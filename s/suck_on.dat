5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly <b>suck</b> <b>on</b> the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

25|$|A pecker or penis gag is a gag {{that has}} a bulge {{resembling}} a phallus (erect penis) or a nipple that is placed into the mouth to enable the wearer to <b>suck</b> <b>on</b> it {{in a manner similar}} to an adult pacifier. The use of a phallic shape is intended to give it an erotic connotation, but it may be a large knob— similar to a ball gag— or may be inflatable. The pecker gag may be wide and flat and large enough almost to fill the mouth, intended to depress the tongue.|$|E

[...] After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name, the band reverted to the name Weird War.

500|$|Scooch had {{reformed}} in hope {{of performing}} at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, and the song was specifically written for the Contest; Eurovision rules state that the song must be an original composition and released no more than seven months before the contest. Russ, as the captain, opens and closes the song with captain's announcements. Natalie and Caroline sing the vocals of the song, as David offers passengers confectioneries. The lyrics are heavily based on actual experiences of flying. The song contains a liberal amount of sexual innuendo, the most overt being [...] "...and blow into the mouthpiece" [...] and [...] "Would you like something to <b>suck</b> <b>on</b> for landing, sir?" [...] (the latter was omitted or changed for some tea-time television performances). The camp style was both praised and criticised - The Guardian noted that the song was, in terms of Eurovision, outdated and similar to Buck's Fizz's winning entry in 1981, while Tim Moore called the song [...] "a fine song in Eurovision tradition".|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} orgasm survived during Romanticism and is {{incorporated}} in many homoerotic works.

For Shelley, orgasm was [...] "the almost involuntary consequences of a state of abandonment in the society of a person of surpassing attractions".
