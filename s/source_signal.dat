5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the <b>source</b> <b>signal,</b> or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, sound {{engineers}} {{have seen the}} introduction of dual [...] "fft" [...] (fast-fourier transform) based audio analysis software which allows an engineer to view not only frequency vs. amplitude (pitch vs. volume) information that an RTA provides, but also {{to see the same}} signals (sounds) in the time domain.

In the proposed system, artificial speech articulated with extremely small sound <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> is detected with a Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) microphone, and then, the detected artificial speech is converted into more natural voice in a probabilistic manner.

40|$|Abstract: This Paper {{addresses}} {{the problem to}} solve Separation of independent <b>sources</b> in composite <b>signal,</b> using fast independent component analysis (FICA). The term blind refers {{to the fact that}} no explicit knowledge of <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> or mixing system is available. In a statistical signal processing, <b>signals</b> from multiple <b>sources</b> arrive simultaneously at the receiver array, so that each receiver array output contains a mixture of <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> that is random signals. Sets of receiver outputs are processed to recover the <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> or to identify the mixing system. FICA approach uses statistical independence of the <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> to solve the (BSS) problems [13]. Estimating the original <b>source</b> <b>signals</b> without knowing the parameters of mixing and/or filtering processes. It is difficult to imagine that one can estimate this at all. In fact, without some a priori knowledge, {{it is not possible to}} uniquely estimate the original <b>source</b> <b>signals.</b> However, one can usually estimate them up to certain indeterminacies.

Therefore, in SCA, either a clustering approach or a masking procedure can result in estimation of the mixing matrix.
