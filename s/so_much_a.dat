5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> part of the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, Chandler focused his {{attacks on the}} Combs {{administration}} rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E

25|$|Diamond {{argues that}} Eurasian civilization is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> product of ingenuity, but of {{opportunity}} and necessity.

25|$|There is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> protest song {{trend in}} France, but rather of a {{permanent}} background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it. World War II and its horrors forced French singers to think more critically about war in general, forcing them to question their governments and the powers who ruled their society.|$|E

25|$|Today the {{significance}} of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now seen as strange or wrong.

25|$|Critics also {{dispute the}} claim that Centering Prayer is in the {{tradition}} of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer is not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.|$|E
25|$|General Burnside {{replaced}} McClellan on the Union side, {{and delayed}} {{for a number}} of weeks near Warrenton, Va. waiting for pontoon builders before marching his reinforced army of 120,281 men to Falmouth, across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg, Va.. General Lee had massed his troops in and around the Fredericksburg area. What followed was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> battle as a military tragedy for the Union.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, there was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> national system as a venerable patchwork of production, distribution, and taxation. The salt trade in one province, Hunan, was estimated to involve some 1,000 traders, six to nine thousand junkmen, and about 1,000 state employees and officials, including police. In the broader Lianghuai region altogether some 369,000 people were employed, including 230,000 laborers in the salt fields.|$|E
25|$|Communicative {{language}} teaching (CLT), {{also known as}} the Communicative Approach, emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language.

25|$|The {{highest point}} carries not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> cairn as a {{rearrangement}} of some loose rock {{at the apex}} of the pyramid. The panorama is excellent, improved immeasurably by the steep final slope and lack of foreground. Every major group of fells in Lakeland is seen well from this superb vantage-point — the Helvellyn range from end to end and the Langdale Pikes across Langdale — but the piece of the view is Scafell Pike towering above Eskdale.|$|E
25|$|In The Rise of American Civilization (1927), Charles and Mary Beard {{argue that}} slavery was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> social or {{cultural}} institution {{as an economic}} one (a labor system). The Beards cited inherent conflicts between Northeastern finance, manufacturing, and commerce and Southern plantations, which competed to control the federal government so as {{to protect their own}} interests. According to the economic determinists of the era, both groups used arguments over slavery and states' rights as a cover.|$|E

Some Shakespeare sonnets in Marshak's translation have been set to music (in classical style by Dmitry Kabalevsky, in pop style by Tikhon Khrennikov, Mikael Tariverdiev, Alla Pugacheva and others, even in rock style — Kruiz). His translations are considered classics in Russia. But many of Marshak's poetic translations became so entrenched in Russian culture, that it was often quipped that he was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> translator as a co-author.|$|E
