40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{particle size}} distribution of three different soils Alfisols, Inceptisols and Entisols in the Gubi Soil Series, Bauchi were studied. The investigation revealed that the soils were generally deep and sandy in texture although the Entisol contains more silt than the sand fraction. Both the Afisols and Inceptisols had transitional horizons between the A and B horizons and also contain kandic (k) horizons. The topsoil colours in the Alfisols and Inceptisols were dominantly dark brown while the subsoils were yellowish to yellowish brown. The Entisols had dark yellowish brown to dark gray colour at the surface and light gray to olive brown in the subsoil. Soil structure was weak coarse subangular blocky for the Inceptisols and Alfisos (except for one profile in the Alfisol which together with the Entisols was structureless. <b>Soil</b> <b>consistence</b> was moist and friable or moist and very friable across soil types. There was evidence of organism (roots) in all the profile with plenty iron concretions and calcium nodules. A proper management of these soils will require additions of organic matter and fertilization with inorganic fertilizers for optimum crop production...|$|E
40|$|Shear soil {{strength}} {{is an important}} dynamic property of the soil, {{as well as the}} state of <b>soil</b> <b>consistence</b> concerning the structure behavior of agricultural soils, which are mostly being ignored in research into the influence of use and management. This fact has been contributing to the perennial problem of fallacious strategies, causing degradation of the physical and mechanical soil properties. This study aimed at an evaluation of the shear {{soil strength}} of a dystrophic Red Latosol submitted to conventional tillage, direct seeding, and Cerrado as control treatment, with different water contents: 0. 05; 0. 16; 0. 18, and 0. 38 kg kg - 1. Results allowed the conclusion that the shear strength of the soil, appraised at a depth of 0 - 0. 05 m of a dystrophic Red Latosol, was affected by water content increases, use and management type. In general, the adjusted equations according to the Coulomb model evidenced greater shear strength in the Cerrado, followed by conventional tillage, and direct seeding. The lowest shear strength of the studied soil, corroborated by the smallest internal friction angle (tg φ) and larger apparent cohesion (c), specifically for the water content 0. 16 and 0. 27 kg kg - 1 (contemplating, therefore, the friable range of the soil), pointed to direct seeding as the management with the greatest possibilities of preserving the structural sustainability of the soil studied. The prediction of shear tension proved {{to be sensitive to the}} effects of soil water variations and the use type. This enables significant contributions, particularly to studies on the structural sustainability of agricultural soils, which are usually impaired by inadequate traffic and tillage operations...|$|E
40|$|The north {{ring road}} in Semarang City – Central Java, is an {{important}} road since the function of products and services transportation which are passing this north traject of Central Java becoming more dense and commonly bring a very heavy load. Besides, this road often passing soil within a quite thick of sedimented alluvium; a clay ground within consistency from very soft until very hard slice, covered with underground coat, consists of compressible soft-slice land, and located in 5. 00 until 20. 00 metres depth. The load of vehicles, especially for the heavy loaded vehicles that passing through continuously, without recovering the soil before, the diminishing of consolidation about 2. 5 metres will occur. The soft-slice soil that we discussed before is the original soil, consisting some slices of soft until very soft <b>soil</b> <b>consistence.</b> From the analytical result, we found that those basic slices of soil are such a kind of clay slice, within a very high density and visually emerged as peat soil. There are two weaknesses of this soil; first it has relatively low strength which cannot support the high embankment of the road, second it has relatively high consolidation settlement that will shape {{the surface of the}} road become scraggly and waven. The empowerment of basic soil system used in the early soft soil design for The Development Project of North Ring Road in Semarang City – Central Java, is using the combination of Prefabricated Vertical Drain (PVD) and Geotextile Woven. This combination has some advantages such as a large discharge capacity, a proper tensile strength of drains, a large permeability and permittivity filter, also the volatility in practice. Within the analysis, the writer also adding alternative methods through the combination of geotextile woven, bamboo pile, and anchored sheet pile which has almost the same advantage as the combination of PVD and Geotextile, but in more efficient ways in using materials.

40|$|Soils play an {{important}} role in grape growing and wine making. Soils anchor the vine and act a reservoir of water and nutrients essential for growth. Soils influence the vine microclimate and therefore wine characteristics. [...] . This report is organized into 16 chapters, and these can be grouped into three part. The first part includes this introduction, and chapters on geological history, landform history and and overview of the soils within the the Waipara and Waikari regions of North Canterbury. This last chapter includes a summary table listing the landforms, regolith, soil and their New Zealand Soil Classification and maps of the landforms and dominant soil series associated with wine growing in North Canterbury. The second part of the report is ordered using the landform relationships of the predominant soils established in the previous section. This is referred to as a physiographic order from the highest and steepest parts of the landscape to the youngest surfaces alongside streams and rivers and on recently active fans. There are eight sections in this part and all available information on the soils’ morphology (description) and chemistry are included in this section up to the time of completion of this report. The third part of the report includes three chapters. The first section is a discussion of soil mapping and the definition of terms associated with soil mapping. These include field identification of soil profiles and soil profile description and the definition of soil horizon notation used in this report and field determination of <b>soil</b> texture, <b>consistence</b> and structure. A simple field method for determining the presence of primary and secondary calcium carbonate using a dilute acid is described. This chapter concludes with the New Zealand Soil Classification (Hewitt, 2010) relevant to the soils of North Canterbury described in this report. The next chapter is a discussion on the interpretation of soil chemistry data. The final chapter in this section comprises tables listing the vineyards of the Waipara and Waikari regions of North Canterbury grouped by the dominant soil or combinations of soils within vineyards. The location of Waipara vineyards are plotted on three maps, of the Omihi Valley, north of the Waipara River and the southern part of the Omihi valley, and south of the Waipara River.

40|$|The Pilot Farm Ježevo was {{established}} {{in accordance with the}} Project UNDP for Yugoslavia, with the aim of its future growing into an experimental station for heavy hydromorphic soils, which would have wider, international significance (ILACO, 1972). Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the production plots 8, 19 and 17 with pipe drainage of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m). According to the marked oder of production plots, they are former: noncalcareous, vertic, humous, amphigley soils, mineral variety of amphigley soils, also noncalcareous and vertic, and - browned meadow soils. Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the Pilot Farm Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9). Further more, by the low values of the consistence index (lower than 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50) with the corresponding liquid state or very soft plasticity in the course of spring (Table 2). 2. In the described conditions to <b>soil</b> <b>consistence,</b> mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil. They are characterised by high values of the coefficient of linear extensibility (0. 12 - 0. 22) and swelling (N...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Injection of {{botulinum toxin}} into the anal {{sphincter}} {{is a novel}} and safe new treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and anal fissure in children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the utility of intra sphincteric injection of botox in the treatment of children with refractory constipation. Methods: All children who suffered from chronic constipation for more than three months, and who had not responded to medical treatment, were referred to pediatrics surgical clinic for surgical intervention by pediatric gastroenterologist. The patients were randomly divided into cases and control group. The control group received no injection and was only treated with stool softeners. The case group received this therapy in addition to injection. After the botox injection, patients were asked about the presence of the signs of constipation including painful defecation, vomiting, stool <b>consistence,</b> <b>soiling</b> and defecation interval. Findings: Defecation of painful stool existed in 88 % of patients before botox injection and it was reduced to 15 % after botox injection. In the control group, 90 % of patients had painful defecation, which reduced to 86 % after medical treatment (P= 0. 0001). Stool was hard in 80 % of patients before was reduced to 28 % after botox injection. In the control group, it existed in 81 % of children and reduced to 78 % after medical treatment (P= 0. 0001). Soiling existed in 62 % of patients before and was reduced to 8 % after botox injection, but in the control group it reduced from 62 % to 42. 5 % after medical treatment (P= 0. 0001). In the control group, 98 % of the patients had defecation intervals more than 3 days and it was the same after medical treatment. In case group, this index before botox injection was 9. 1 days, and after botox injection was reduced to 2. 6 days (P= 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our study results showed that injection of botulinum toxin into anal sphincter is an effective and safe new treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in children...|$|R
