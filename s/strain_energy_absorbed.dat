40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to provide {{the link between the}} fatigue behaviour of pre-strained aluminium alloys and the scaling properties of damage induced on the fracture surface. Fatigue tests performed on pre-strained aluminium alloys revealed a large difference in their residual fatigue resistance linked to the material: the Al-Cu alloy demonstrated a sharp decrease of HCF life-time due to the pre-straining whereas the insensitivity of the Al-Mg alloy was clear. For the Al-Cu alloy, the investigations made at a 'mechanical' scale allow us to associate the <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> during the prior loading with the aspect of the surface and the residual HCF life-time. The statistical characterisation of the fatigue damaged zone was done from the measurement of the surface roughness.

The relationship between mechanical twinning fraction and mechanical behavior of this steel was studied through tension tests at the following temperatures: 25, 300, 325, 350, 375 and 400 °C. Fracture toughness was measured from J integral evaluation at temperatures where the principal hardening mechanism is mechanical twinning and dislocation glide (325 and 375 °C respectively), for which a set of CT samples were pre-cracked by fatigue and then loaded until fracture in accordance to ASTM 1820.

An identation technique {{was used to compare}} the apparent fracture toughness (K) and hardness of six dental ceramic materials to a control soda-lime-silica glass. The materials studied included Vita VMK 68 body porcelain, Optec HSP body porcelain, Dicor, IPS- Empress castable ceramics, Vitadur N core porcelain and In-Ceram core porcelain. Alumina reinforced materials (In-Ceram core) resulted in the highest fracture toughness values followed by Vitadur N core porcelain. IPS-Empress and Optec HSP materials showed moderate but statistically significant (P 0. 0001) greater values compared to conventional feldspathic porcelain Vita VMK 68 and a control soda-lime-silica glass. These differences in K were attributed to differences in the nature of crack microstructure interaction.

40|$|This study proposes an {{alternate}} method {{for the analysis}} of beams with solid cross-section or built as a framed structure and subjected to transverse impact loads from an external striker. The procedure used in the analysis is a combination of two essential tools using pseudo-dynamic techniques. The method reported here involves only one degree of freedom for the structure modelling and assumes an elastic contact between an external striker and the beam structure, which in reality does not happen. As only one degree of freedom is considered in the analysis, some important limitations are inherent to the method proposed here. Essentially, there is the difficulty of modelling the displacement field associated with the transient structure behaviour accurately, as a consequence of fast-rate impact loads. Another difficulty faced by the method refers to a local structure behaviour associated with contact loads. The present method can deal with large displacements in transversely loaded beams associated to a collapse mechanism having a simple geometry and defined with precision from a single parameter. This ensures reasonable accuracy in the evaluation of the <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> capacity of transversely impacted beam structures using a single degree of freedom model in a pseudo-dynamic procedure.

These are mainly due to the {{increase}} in the number of vehicles particularly those with high axle loads, due to the environmental conditions and also due to construction and design errors.

This paper aims to highlight previous research works conducted on the effects of using different types of additives and aggregate gradation on fatigue and rutting resistance of AC mixtures.

An understanding of its mechanical response is essential both from the point of its normal function as well as injury prognosis. Since purely experimental investigations cannot provide complete information, mathematical models to supplement experimental records are necessary. In this study a finite element model of a lumbar intervertebral segment is developed to analyze the stress distributions and <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> capacities. Experiments were conducted to obtain the geometry and load-deflection data. The nonlinear sigmoidal load-deflection behavior was divided into five distinct phases based on the variation of stiffness, defined by the instantaneous slope of the load-deflection diagram. The threshold of trauma was defined at the point at which the structure exhibited softening characteristics (this corresponds with the first drop of stiffness). Load at this level was termed as the micro failure of softening load. At the point of ultimate load, the specimen had zero stiffness. The non-linear axisymmetric (geometrical and material) model incorporated the cartilagenious and cortical bone, the endplates, and the disc. The nucleus pulposus was modeled using isoparametric quadrilateral fluid elements. The model was validated with experimental axial load-deflection data. To exercise the model, homogeneous, isotropic, and loading path independent material parameters were used for all the components of the spinal segment with the exception of the annulus. The Young's modulus of annulus was estimated as a function of load level using the method of steepest descent. The disc absorbed about 84 % of the total <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> in the initial loading phase (ambient range), and at the threshold of failure, it gradually decreased to about 65 %.

40|$|Cellular {{materials}} that are often observed in biological systems exhibit excellent mechanical properties at remarkably low densities. Luffa sponge is one of such materials with a complex interconnecting porous structure. In this paper, we studied the relationship between its structural and mechanical properties {{at different levels of}} its hierarchical organization from a single fiber to a segment of whole sponge. The tensile mechanical behaviors of three single fibers were examined by an Instron testing machine and the ultrastructure of a fractured single fiber was observed in a scanning electronic microscope. Moreover, the compressive mechanical behaviors of the foam-like blocks from different locations of the sponge were examined. The difference of the compressive stress-strain responses of four sets of segmental samples were also compared. The result shows that the single fiber is a porous composite material mainly consisting of cellulose fibrils and lignin/hemicellulose matrix, and its Young's modulus and strength are comparable to wood. The mechanical behavior of the block samples from the hoop wall is superior to that from the core part. Furthermore, it shows that the influence of the inner surface on the mechanical property of the segmental sample is stronger than that of the core part; in particular, the former's Young's modulus, strength and <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> are about 1. 6 times higher.

Unlike the conventional impact method, the specimens {{were placed on the}} bottom platen of an Instron machine with a constant upwards velocity and then the tube collided with the fixed upper rigid platen. Load-deflection curves of empty tubes were first obtained and analysed. From the viewpoint of deformation modes and plastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the tube quadrants around the proximal surface and distal surface, a critical velocity of impact is determined which corresponds to a mode change. A relationship is found to exist between the critical velocity and thickness-to-diameter ratio as well as the yield stress and density of the material. To understand the dynamic crushing behaviour of short aluminium foam-filled sandwich tubes by two rigid platens, further tests and corresponding finite element analysis were performed, respectively. Similar to the observations in the quasi-static tests, the mode of dynamic collapse is bending, with the formation of plastic bending zones accompanied with core crushing. Corresponding FE models for ABAQUS/Explicit were developed and validated against the experimental observations. Detailed deformation features and energy absorption characteristics during the crushing process were identified. It was found that increasing the compression velocity leads to an increase in the total internal plastic energy dissipation for both empty and sandwich tube. The propagation of plastic bending in the form of double-moving-hinges is the main mechanism of energy dissipation, as opposed to the low velocity impact which involves stationary plastic deformation zones...|$|E

The sandwich plate studied consists of three layers. The two outer layers are of mild steel and the centre layer, or core, is of air. Because of this configuration, the analysis is split into two sections. The first {{is the study of}} impulsively loaded circular single plates and the second is the study of the interaction of the outer layers of the sandwich plate on each other. The plates are analysed in the impulse range that results in large plastic deformations known as Mode I Failure. Mode II and III failure of the plates, where failure by tearing occurs, is omitted. The results of the single plate analysis are compared to experimental and analytical work. Criteria for comparison include mid-plate deflections, strain rate dependence, strain predictions, plate thinning, deformation shape and response time. The results of the sandwich plate analysis are compared to experimental data and the criteria for comparison include mid-plate deflections and the diameter of the contact area of the two outer layers. Other aspects of the plate behaviour such as response times and the amount of <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> are also discussed.

40|$|AbstractA {{fundamental}} experimental investigation, with corresponding computational simulations, {{was conducted}} to understand the physical mechanisms of implosions of cylindrical shells occurring within a tubular confining space which has a limited potential energy reservoir. In particular, attention was focused on studying the generation of pressure waves from the implosion, {{the interaction of the}} pressure waves with the confining tube walls and end caps, and the collapse mechanisms of the implodable volume. Experiments were conducted with three implodable volume geometries which had similar critical collapse pressures. The implodable volumes were aluminum 6061 -T 6 cylindrical tubing and were placed concentrically within the confining tube. Pressure histories recorded {{along the length of the}} confining tube during the experiments were utilized to analytically evaluate the deformation of the implodable volume using fluid–structure coupled deformation models. Computational simulations were conducted using a coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian scheme to explicitly model the implosion process of the tubes along with the resulting compressible fluid flow. The numerical model developed in this study is shown to have high correlation with the experimental results and will serve as a predictive tool for the simulation of the implosion of different cylindrical geometries as well as various tube-in-tube implosion configurations. The experimental results show that the limited hydrostatic potential energy available in a confined environment, as compared to a free field, significantly influences the implosion process. The wall velocities of the implodable volume during the collapse, as well as the extent of the collapse progression, are largely affected by the sudden decrease in the available hydrostatic potential energy. This energy is shown to be partially transformed into elasto-plastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the deformation of the implodable volume, as well as the kinetic energy of the water during the implosion process. Experiments also show that the extent of the collapse progression of an implodable volume can potentially be inhibited within a closed environment, which can lead to the arresting of an implosion event prior to completion for larger implodable volumes. The pressure waves generated during collapse comprise of waves emitted due to the impact of the implodable volume walls, the arrest of rushing water and contact propagation along the walls.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{technique}} for tuning the energy absorption properties of laminated and sandwich composites {{through a new}} tailoring concept is presented. The purpose is to minimize the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> through unwanted modes (ones involving interlaminar strengths) and maximize that absorbed through desired modes (ones involving membrane strengths) by finding a suited in-plane variable distribution of stiffness properties. Herein mode is intended as a <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> contribution, such as bending energy, in-plane and out-of-plane shear energy, etc., and no vibration mode. This distribution is obtained making extremal certain <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> contributions of interest (for example, membrane, bending, in-plane, and out-of-plane shear energies) under in-plane variation of the plate stiffness properties. The effect of this technique is {{to act as an}} energy absorption tuning, since it minimizes or maximizes the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> by specific modes. Although the present technique could be applied to laminates or to the face sheets of sandwich composites, in this paper a preliminary application is presented to single plies with variable stiffness coefficients over their plane. Once incorporated into a laminate or a sandwich composite, these layers are shown to have beneficial effects on the strength at the onset of delamination in sample cases where laminated and sandwich composites are subjected to low velocity, low energy impact...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Composite domes made of short, {{randomly}} oriented {{glass fiber}} mats with polyester resin {{were subjected to}} axial compression in an Instron machine, in both empty and foam filled conditions. The domes were of different sizes and their generator was a parabola. The mechanics of deformation and the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> characteristics of the shells were studied, and their load compression curves are presented. The effect of foam filling on {{the response of the}} domes is discussed. Based on the experimental observations analytical expressions were formulated to find the average crush load and total <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> by considering the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> in different mechanisms involved in the crushing process. The results thus obtained were compared with experimental results and these match well. Some conical shells made of the same material, height and diameter as those of domes were also subjected to axial compression, and their behavior is compared with those of the corresponding domes...|$|R
40|$|Innovative {{nanocomposite}} acrylic sheets incorporated with marble waste granules (MWG) {{were prepared}} by free radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The study of physicomechanical properties showed an improvement of adhesion between PMMA/SiO 2 nanocomposites and (MWG). The introduction of SiO 2 nanoparticles induced an extraordinary {{improvement of the}} abrasion resistance of PMMA matrix. The modulii of elasticities, maximum <b>strain,</b> impact <b>absorbed</b> <b>energy</b> and scratch resistance are explained {{on the basis of}} (MWG) porosity and adhesion. The manufactured nanocomposite sheets are cost effective in comparison with natural marble and possess the ability to have wide range of wonderful colors due to the inclusion of marble stones in a polymer matrix. In addition, the sheets display other specific properties such as light weight, color stability, electric insulation, low flammability, low water absorption and excellent mechanical properties.

40|$|The {{effect of}} z-pin {{reinforcement}} on the structural properties and damage tolerance of composite joints is experimentally studied in this article. The ultimate load, failure <b>strain,</b> and <b>absorbed</b> <b>energy</b> capacity of carbon fiber-epoxy T-joints and single lap joints increased rapidly with the volume content of z-pins. The improvement to these properties {{was due to}} the capacity of z-pins to resist unstable (rapid) delamination growth along the bonded region to the T-joints (induced by interlaminar mode I stress) and lap joints (induced by interlaminar mode II stress) by forming a crack bridging traction zone. Large increases to the damage tolerance of T-joints and lap joints containing pre-existing bond-line cracks were also achieved by z-pins. The z-pins formed a bridging traction zone across the delaminated bond-line which retained high strength in the joints, even in the presence of very long cracks which severely weakened conventional joints...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 28 Mar 2017 The {{intrinsic}} specific energy, that is {{the minimum}} energy consumed by pure cutting action to cut unit volume of rock, along with the rock <b>strain</b> <b>energy,</b> {{that is the}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>energy</b> by unit volume of rock in uniaxial compression, were used together to assess rock cutting performance. A series of rock cutting tests using a single polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutter under steady conditions, and uniaxial compressive tests with a single-cyclic loading, otherwise monotonic loading were carried out on rock samples. Different rock types having unconfined compressive strength values of 9 – 249 MPa were carefully tested to determine the intrinsic specific <b>energy</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> values. The results suggest that stress and strain characteristics of the rock obtained from uniaxial compressive tests, in terms of <b>absorbed</b> <b>energy,</b> {{can be related to}} cutting performance. Therefore, it was concluded that the <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> can be used to assess the intrinsic specific energy to evaluate drilling performance in PDC cutting.

40|$|The {{non-crimp}} {{features of}} {{warp and weft}} yarns impart the highest energy absorptions to 3 D orthogonal woven fabric (3 DOWF) than other kinds of 3 D woven fabrics under ballistic impact. There are greater potential applications of the 3 DOWF in ballistic protection. In this paper, an analytical model was proposed to calculate the energy absorption of the 3 DOWF under ballistic penetration of a hemispherical-cylindrical rigid projectile. The analytical model covers the calculations of the <b>energies</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the warp, weft, and Z-yarns and the determinations of penetration time from the impact loading strain rate. The stress wave propagations in the warp, weft, and Z-yarns were analyzed to formulate the fabric deformation and <b>strain</b> <b>energy.</b> The influence of strain rate on the residual velocities of the projectile was investigated. From the <b>absorbed</b> <b>energy</b> distribution calculated by the analytical model, the factors for improving ballistic performance of the 3 DOWF are discussed.
