A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Adrift in a Great City is a 1914 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Film Corporation that stars Florence LaBadie. The film begins with Pat Moran who pays for the passage {{of his wife and}} daughter to join him in America, but he is seriously injured on the way to greeting them. Left by themselves, the daughter works in a <b>sweatshop</b> and goes blind, forcing her and her mother to become beggars. By pure happenstance, the blind girl wanders to the hospital where her father is recovering and tells her story to a doctor. The father recognizes the girl as his daughter and the family is reunited, and the doctor confirms her blindness can be cured. The film was reviewed negatively by critics for its poor scenario, settings and technical execution. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could not bear to deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese <b>sweatshop</b> for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E

He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a <b>sweatshop</b> in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|Pat Moran, {{the foreman}} of a {{construction}} gang, {{worked hard to}} save up {{enough money to pay}} for the passage of his wife and daughter to their new home in America.

5|$|The {{production}} facility for Daicon IV {{was in a}} dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union. Takeda defined it as a literal anime <b>sweatshop,</b> the building was shutdown at 9:00 pm {{and a majority of}} the staff would be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning. The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors. Toru Saegusa did the artwork and the animations were done with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mahiro Maeda, Norifumi Kiyozumi; additional animation was provided by Ichiro Itano, Toshihiro Hirano, Narumi Kakinouchi, Sadami Morikawa, Kazutaka Miyatake. Originally, Daicon IV was supposed to be fifteen minutes long, but the difficult production resulted in the cut time.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their <b>sweatshop</b> tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E

As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term <b>sweatshop</b> came {{to refer to a}} broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior.

40|$|Today’s <b>sweatshops</b> violate our {{notions of}} justice, yet they {{continue}} to flourish. This is so because we have not settled on criteria that {{would allow us to}} condemn and do away with them and because the poor working conditions in certain places are preferable to the alternative of no job at all. In this paper, we examine these phenomena. We consider the definitional dilemmas posed by <b>sweatshops</b> by routing a standard definition of <b>sweatshops</b> through the precepts put forward in the literature on justice and virtue ethics. We conclude that fixing on definitions is pointless and misleading and that we are better off looking at whether or not a workplace violates the basic human rights of workers and whether or not the working conditions there cohere with situations on which we have already rendered judgments. In the end, we suggest guidelines for businesses that operate in the global workplace to help them avoid charges of running <b>sweatshops.</b> These recommendations account for the harsh living conditions in certain developing and emerging countries as well as the norms of societies in developed countries.

25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} <b>sweatshop</b> critics {{were found in the}} 19th century abolitionist movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel slavery, and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and <b>sweatshop</b> work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the Factory Act of 1833) was passed in the United Kingdom {{at the same time that}} the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.|$|E

25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in <b>sweatshops,</b> proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the <b>sweatshops</b> are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, <b>sweatshops</b> offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|R

They believe that better-paying jobs, increased capital investment and domestic ownership of resources will improve the economies of sub-Saharan Africa rather than <b>sweatshops.</b> They point to good labor standards developing strong manufacturing export sectors in wealthier sub-Saharan countries such as Mauritius and believe measures like these will improve economic conditions in developing nations.|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1890s that the first modern {{legislative}} attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia. The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping <b>sweatshop</b> labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries. The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered to be substandard wages. The <b>sweatshop</b> owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and a minimum wage was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly. Over time, the focus changed to helping people, especially families, become more self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|The phrase <b>sweatshop</b> {{was coined}} in 1850, meaning a factory or {{workshop}} where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working {{long hours and}} in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York {{for more than one}} century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term <b>sweatshop</b> was used from Charles Kingsley’s Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create ‘sweating system’ of workers. (Blackburn, 1991) The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s.  This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.|$|E
