5|$|When this {{prayer is}} finished, the choir sings an English {{translation}} of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon {{is followed by a}} rite of benediction consisting of several prayers.|$|E

60|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{a part of}} Mrs. Heep's humility, that she <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> weeds. Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had {{occurred}} since Mr. Heep's decease, she <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> weeds. I think there was some compromise in the cap; but otherwise she was as weedy as {{in the early days}} of her mourning.|$|R

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months until the end of the war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|The {{overhaul}} {{was completed}} in January 2016 and testing began on the East Lancashire Railway on 8 January 2016, with the locomotive <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> its 2011 Wartime Black livery with the numbers 60103 on the smokebox, and its appropriate LNER Wartime numbers, 103 and 502 on the cab sides. Flying Scotsman was originally going to haul its inaugural mainline train called the Winter Cumbrian Mountain Express from Manchester Victoria to Carlisle on 23 January, {{but it was not}} ready due to faulty brakes. The first mainline run, pulling the Winter Cumbrian Mountain Express from Carnforth to Carlisle, took place on 6 February. An inaugural journey from London King's Cross to York in British Railways Brunswick Green livery ran on 25 February. However, during this event, railway enthusiasts accidentally stopped Flying Scotsman due to their trespassing on the line near St Neots. Flying Scotsman made special tours throughout the UK in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Hajibeyov devoted {{much energy}} {{to the idea of}} {{integrating}} woman's role and status into the male-dominated world. The concept of women's emancipation runs through many of his works often in the form of comedy or satirization as in the case when he makes fun of the process of selecting marriage partners, a process hindered by the fact that women were <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> veils until the 1920s when the Soviet regime prohibited them.|$|E

25|$|Linda and Charlotte Mulhall are sisters from Dublin, Ireland, {{known for}} having killed and dismembered their mother's boyfriend, Farah Swaleh Noor, in March 2005.

25|$|Police {{also often}} carry an impact weapon - a baton, {{also known as}} a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been {{replaced}} in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while <b>still</b> <b>wearing</b> the baton on their duty belt. The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons like mace, pepper spray, electroshock guns, and beanbag shotgun rounds.|$|E
