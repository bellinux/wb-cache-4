40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of providing information by post about managing minor illnesses. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Six general practices. Participants: Random sample of 4002 patients from the practice registers. Intervention: Patients were randomised to receive one of three kinds of leaflet or booklet endorsed by their general practitioner: control (surgery access times), booklet, or <b>summary</b> <b>card.</b> Main outcome measures: Attendance with the 42 minor illnesses listed in the booklet. Perceived usefulness of leaflets or booklets, confidence in managing illness, and willingness to wait before seeing the doctor. Results: 238 (6 %) patients did not receive the intervention as allocated. Of the remaining 3764 patients, 2965 (79 %) had notes available for review after one year. Compared with the control group, fewer patients attended commonly with the minor illnesses in the booklet group (? 2 consultations a year: odds ratio 0. 81, 95 % confidence interval 0. 67 to 0. 99) and the <b>summary</b> <b>card</b> group (0. 83; 0. 72 to 0. 96). Among patients who had attended with respiratory tract infections {{in the past year}} there was a reduction in those attending in the booklet group (0. 81; 0. 62 to 1. 07) and <b>summary</b> <b>card</b> group (0. 67; 0. 51 to 0. 89) compared with the control group. The incidence of contacts with minor illness fell slightly compared with the previous year in the booklet (incidence ratio 0. 97; 0. 84 to 1. 13) and <b>summary</b> <b>card</b> groups (0. 93; 0. 80 to 1. 07). More patients in the intervention groups felt greater confidence in managing illness (booklet 32 %, card 34 %, control 12 %, P< 0. 001), but {{there was no difference in}} willingness to wait score (all groups mean= 32, P= 0. 67). Conclusion: Most patients find information about minor illness provided by post useful, and it helps their confidence in managing illness. Information may reduce the number attending commonly with minor illness, but the effect on overall contacts is likely to be modest. These data suggest that posting detailed information booklets about minor illness to the general population would have a limited effect...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} facility-based case reviews (medical audits) in a maternity unit and their effect on the staff involved. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: A 26 -bed obstetric unit in a district hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. SAMPLE: Sixteen audit sessions conducted between February 2004 and June 2005. Thirty-five staff members were interviewed. METHODS: An analysis of all the tools used {{in the management of}} the audit was performed: attendance lists, case <b>summary</b> <b>cards</b> and register of recommendations. The perceptions of the staff about the audits were collected through a questionnaire administrated by an external investigator from 10 June 2005 to 16 June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Session participation, types of problems identified, recommendations proposed and implemented and staff reaction to the audits. RESULTS: Only 7 midwives from a total of 15 regularly attended the sessions. Eighty-two percent of the recommendations made during the audits have been implemented, but sometimes after a delay of several months. Interviewed personnel had a good understanding of the audit goals and viewed audit as a factor in changing their practice. However, midwives highlighted problems of bad interpersonal communication and lack of anonymity during the audit sessions, and pointed out the difficulty of practising self-criticism. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of staff commitment and the resistance of maternity personnel to being evaluated by their peers or service users are reducing acceptance of routine audits. The World Health Organization must take all these factors into account when promoting the institutionalisation of medical audits in obstetrics...|$|R

40|$|Almost {{a decade}} ago we all might have heard about the smart card {{and its role in}} the {{financial}} sector, especially for retail transactions.

The malaise of unemployment persists in many rural and regional locations. Two years after the Brotherhood of St Laurence first identified â€˜hotspotsâ€™ from Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force survey data, a new analysis identifies four regional areas where youth unemployment rates cluster above 20 per cent. For the worst performer â€“ in the outback of Queensland, including the mining hub of Mount Isa â€“ the rate reached 28 per cent. The national youth unemployment rate of 15 â€“ 24 year olds, at 12. 2 per cent (trend rate in January 2016), remains well above the levels before the global financial crisis of 2008, when it dipped below 9 per cent. More welcome news, though, {{can be found in}} tracking the decline in youth unemployment from the high in December 2014 of almost 14 per cent.

40|$|Different {{approaches}} are possible {{when it comes}} to modeling the brain. Given its biological nature, models can be constructed out of the chemical and biological building blocks known to be at play in the brain, formulating a given mechanism in terms of the basic interactions underlying it. On the other hand, the functions of the brain can be described in a more general or macroscopic way, in terms of desirable goals. This goals may include reducing metabolic costs, being stable or robust, or being efficient in computational terms. Synaptic plasticity, that is, the study of how the connections between neurons evolve in time, is no exception to this. In the following work we formulate (and study the properties of) synaptic plasticity models, employing two complementary approaches: a top-down approach, deriving a learning rule from a guiding principle for rate-encoding neurons, and a bottom-up approach, where a simple yet biophysical rule for time-dependent plasticity is constructed. We begin this thesis with a general overview, in Chapter 1, of the properties of neurons and their connections, clarifying notations and the jargon of the field. These will be our building blocks and will also determine the constrains we need to respect when formulating our models. We will discuss the present challenges of computational neuroscience, as well as the role of physicists in this line of research. In Chapters 2 and 3, we develop and study a local online Hebbian self-limiting synaptic plasticity rule, employing the mentioned top-down approach. Firstly, in Chapter 2 we formulate the stationarity principle of statistical learning, in terms of the Fisher information of the output probability distribution with respect to the synaptic weights. To ensure that the learning rules are formulated in terms of information locally available to a synapse, we employ the local synapse extension to the one dimensional Fisher information. Once the objective function has been defined, we derive an online synaptic plasticity rule via stochastic gradient descent. In order to test the computational capabilities of a neuron evolving according to this rule (combined with a preexisting intrinsic plasticity rule), we perform a series of numerical experiments, training the neuron with different input distributions. We observe that, for input distributions closely resembling a multivariate normal distribution, the neuron robustly selects the first principal component of the distribution, showing otherwise a strong preference for directions of large negative excess kurtosis. In Chapter 3 we study the robustness of the learning rule derived in Chapter 2 with respect to variations in the neural modelâ€™s transfer function. In particular, we find an equivalent cubic form of the rule which, given its functional simplicity, permits to analytically compute the attractors (stationary solutions) of the learning procedure, {{as a function of the}} statistical moments of the input distribution. In this way, we manage to explain the numerical findings of Chapter 2 analytically, and formulate a prediction: if the neuron is selective to non-Gaussian input directions, it should be suitable for applications to independent component analysis. We close this section by showing how indeed, a neuron operating under these rules can learn the independent components in the non-linear bars problem. A simple biophysical model for time-dependent plasticity (STDP) is developed in Chapter 4. The model is formulated in terms of two decaying traces present in the synapse, namely the fraction of activated NMDA receptors and the calcium concentration, which serve as clocks, measuring the time of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. While constructed in terms of the key biological elements thought to be involved in the process, we have kept the functional dependencies of the variables as simple as possible to allow for analytic tractability. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to reproduce several experimental results, including the typical pairwise STDP curve and triplet results, in both hippocampal culture and layer 2 / 3 cortical neurons. Thanks to the modelâ€™s functional simplicity, we are able to compute these results analytically, establishing a direct and transparent connection between the modelâ€™s internal parameters and the qualitative features of the results. Finally, in order to make a connection to synaptic plasticity for rate encoding neural models, we train the synapse with Poisson uncorrelated pre- and postsynaptic spike trains and compute the expected synaptic weight change as a function of the frequencies of these spike trains. Interestingly, a Hebbian (in the rate encoding sense of the word) BCM-like behavior is recovered in this setup for hippocampal neurons, while dominating depression seems unavoidable for parameter configurations reproducing experimentally observed triplet nonlinearities in layer 2 / 3 cortical neurons. Potentiation can however be recovered in these neurons when correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes are present. We end this chapter by discussing the relation to existing experimental results, leaving open questions and predictions for future experiments. A set of <b>summary</b> <b>cards</b> of the models employed, together with listings of the relevant variables and parameters, are presented at the end of the thesis, for easier access and permanent reference for the reader. ...|$|R
