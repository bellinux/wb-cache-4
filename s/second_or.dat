5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E

Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E

This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.|$|E
