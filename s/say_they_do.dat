25|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by Pew Research Center in 2012, the number of Americans who do not identify with any religion has increased from 15% in 2007 to 20% in 2012, and this number continues to grow. One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion, however they identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious, while 68% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> believe in God, and 58% feel a deep connection to the earth.|$|E

The volunteers' public profiles have youthful-sounding usernames, young ages, {{and pictures of}} children. The administrators of the site <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not initiate online contact with the users, and refuse to act on tips from the public as a result. If a user starts chatting to the volunteer and turns the conversation to sex, the volunteer responds positively and encourages them to divulge personal details, particularly a telephone number, ostensibly needed to verify their identity so that a meeting can be arranged.|$|E
25|$|During the 21st century, {{the area}} became more gentrified. In 1998, the Blackwell Island Light was {{restored}} by an anonymous donor. In 2006, the restored Octagon Tower opened, {{serving as the}} central lobby of a two-wing, 500-unit apartment building. In 2010, the Roosevelt Island Tramway reopened after renovations. A year later, Southpoint Park opened south of Goldwater Memorial Hospital, near the island's southern end, Cornell Tech, {{a joint venture between}} Technion– Israel Institute of Technology and Cornell University, was announced the same year. In 2012, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park was dedicated and opened to the public as a state park. Construction of the new Cornell Tech campus began in January 2014 with the arrival of equipment on Roosevelt Island for the building of a fence around the construction site and for the demolition of the existing Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital's south campus; demolition began in March 2014, but city officials <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have plans to close the north campus of the hospital.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E

500|$|Zvi Lederman, {{the other}} {{co-director of the}} dig, {{believes}} that Beth Shemesh was a cultural meeting point {{on the border of}} Israelite, Canaanite, and Philistine areas and calls the stories of Samson [...] "border sagas", noting that Samson could cross boundaries to seek out a Philistine wife, but also to fight and kill Philistines: [...] "When you cross the border, you have to fight the enemy and you encounter dangerous animals. You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} Muslim {{countries}} try to overcome {{some of these}} difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months.

In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> on this subject, and what they actually do.

"If from antiquity to the present, {{and since}} the {{beginning}} of man, there are men who have seen the bodies of ghosts and spirits and heard their voices, how can we say that they do not exist?

According to Edith Cantor, while Paula Smith's original [...] "Trekkie's Tale" [...] was only ten paragraphs long, [...] "in terms of their impact on those whom they affect, those words [...] have got to rank right up there with the Selective Service Act". At Clippercon 1987 (a Star Trek fan convention held yearly in Baltimore, Maryland), Smith interviewed a panel of female authors who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not include female characters in their stories at all. She quoted one as saying [...] "Every time I've tried to put a woman in any story I've ever written, everyone immediately says, this is a Mary Sue."
