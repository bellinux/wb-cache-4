5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, BBC {{producer}} Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen {{to collaborate}} with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of <b>Sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>Film</b> International. Although Stockhausen's music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout in 1971), {{this was the first}} time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for Freitag aus Licht, calling the result Zwei Paare (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled In Absentia, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use [...] When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that his mother had been [...] "imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. … This was a very moving moment for us as well, especially because we had made the film without knowing any of this" [...]|$|E
2500|$|With the {{integration}} of FBO into the new RKO Radio Pictures in 1929, Marcus became the executive vice-president for the new company. He, along with Joseph I. Schnitzer and William LeBaron, were the triumvirate which ran the new company. In February, Marcus announced that the new RCA Photophone process of <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> was the direction the studio would go in, rather than the alternative of sound on disc. He stated, [...] "Our synthesis of sound to action is all that we would want in accuracy, and certainly the exhibitor's projection and sound problem is, to our mind, a much simplified one with sound-on-film." [...] With sound films becoming the norm, Marcus announced that RKO would still produce 40–50 per cent of their sound films with silent versions as well in 1929. Later in 1929 Marcus {{was one of the}} film executives on a committee representing film distributors in their negotiations with exhibition houses in trying to iron out a deal regarding splitting the revenue from movie showings.|$|E

50|$|Salinger is {{recognized}} as MGM's best principal orchestrator of musicals made between 1942 and 1962. He reputedly studied mathematical musical progressions under the influential theorist Joseph Schillinger, whose other students included George Gershwin, and major Broadway/Hollywood orchestrators such as Ted Royal and Herbert W. Spencer. Salinger employed a somewhat smaller orchestra than usual, but nevertheless achieved a rich, elaborately constructed sound in his arrangements. The fact that the orchestra that Salinger used was smaller in size than the normal huge studio orchestra was practically unnoticeable, except {{that the quality of}} the orchestral <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>films</b> that Salinger worked on seemed greatly improved, with much less distortion than was common in the days before true high fidelity.|$|R

50|$|Single system audio is {{the system}} of {{recording}} <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> or SOF. There are two methods of recording, the older method, optical and the later method, magnetic. SOF was primarily used for news film prior to the advent of portable videotape recording, but was used until recently for documentary film recording.|$|E
5000|$|However, in {{the days}} of analog technology, no process {{involving}} a separate disk could hold synchronization precisely or reliably. Vitaphone was quickly supplanted by technologies which recorded an optical soundtrack directly onto the side of the strip of motion picture film. This was the dominant technology from the 1930s through the 1960s and is still in use [...] although the analog soundtrack is being replaced by digital <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> formats.|$|E

50|$|The {{single most}} notable feature of Peludópolis {{was the fact}} that it was the first {{animated}} film to be released with sound. Cristiani added this feature part way through production, before the plot had been rearranged, using the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system to record the sound that was to play alongside the movie. While <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> systems did exist at the time, Argentine theaters were simply unable to support the system. Peludópolis included multiple songs during the film, none of which are known to exist.|$|E
50|$|William Fox, President of the Fox Film Corporation, {{had worked}} with {{inventor}} Theodore W. Case to develop a method for capturing <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> eventually becoming the Movietone sound system. In August 1926 the Fox-Case Corporation was created, making $200,000 worth of improvements to {{what had been the}} Fox Annex, a warehouse at 460 W. 54th St. (Fox Films New York ran out of the giant building at 850 Tenth Avenue, around the corner. It eventually became DeLuxe, and is now Independence High School).|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Movietone" [...] {{had been}} used by Fox Film Corporation since 1926, when it was coined by William Fox to name the process he had bought for putting <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>film</b> for [...] "talkies". By the time the 1965 {{incarnation}} of the record label came along, Fox had issued some 78s on the Fox Movietone label decades earlier, but these were not commercial issues, as far as is known. [...] "Movietone" [...] was also the name Fox gave to its TV and newsreel coverage.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{first film}} studios {{were set up}} in Fort Lee, New Jersey but in 1917, William Fox sent Sol M.
