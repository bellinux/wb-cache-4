25|$|The L.A. riots {{contributed to}} the {{creation}} of new ethnic agendas and organization. A week after the riots, in the largest Asian-American protest ever held in a city, about 30,000 mostly Korean and Korean American marchers walked the streets of L.A. Koreatown, calling for peace and denouncing police violence. This cultural movement was devoted to the protection of Koreans' political rights, ethnic heritage, and political representation. It created a new form of leaders within the community, in which second generation children spoke on behalf of the community. Korean Americans saw a shift in occupation goals, from storeowners to political leaders. Such political voice aided Korean Americans in receiving governmental aid in the reconstruction of their damaged neighborhoods. Countless community and advocacy groups have been established to further fuel Korean political representation and understanding. They experienced firsthand the severity of such isolation, as they were forced to endure the physical and psychological aftermath. The representative voice that was created remains present in South Central Los Angeles, as such events as the riots {{contributed to the}} shaping of identities, perceptions and political and <b>social</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For {{the whole}} Soviet period {{there was no}} {{agreed-upon}} formula at the official level to express the national-cultural identity of this large group of Latvian residents. The ideology of the Communist party rejected {{the tradition of the}} Latvian Republic which identified the Russians of Latvia as one of its national minorities. In the USSR there existed a form of national-territorial autonomy of nations, though not for all nations, which made their <b>social</b> <b>representation</b> in the state bodies unequal. As a result, their influence on the social consciousness was unequal as well. A nation could only be considered [...] "fully-fledged" [...] if it possessed a state system {{in the form of a}} union republic. Therefore, there was only one recognized nation in Latvia– Latvians. The Russians of Latvia, both those who had deep historical roots there and those who chose it as a place of permanent residence after World War II, having no territorial autonomy, were not considered as an individual cultural and national community in the Latvian Republic but rather as part of the larger Russian community of the Soviet Union.|$|E

6000|$|Amerigo {{was away}} from her again, as she sat there, as she walked there without him--for she had, with the {{difference}} of his presence in the house, ceased to keep herself from moving about; but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness, and above all with the effect, strange in an intimacy so established, of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect. She had seen him last but five days since, yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country, some long voyage, some combination of dangers or fatigues. This unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest, {{what did it mean}} but that--reduced to the flatness of mere statement--she was married, by good fortune, to an altogether dazzling person? That was an old, old story, but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture, some mellow portrait of an ancestor, that she might have been looking at, almost in surprise, after a long intermission. The dazzling person was upstairs and she was down, and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required, and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved; but she had, all the same, never felt so absorbingly married, so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate. He could do what he would with her; in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it. [...] "What he would," [...] what he REALLY would--only that quantity itself escaped perhaps, in the brightness of the high harmony, familiar naming and discussing. It was enough of a recognition for her that, whatever the thing he might desire, he would always absolutely bring it off. She knew at this moment, without a question, with the fullest surrender, how he had brought off, in her, by scarce more than a single allusion, a perfect flutter of tenderness. If he had come back tired, tired from his long day, the exertion had been, literally, in her service and her father's. They two had sat at home at peace, the Principino between them, the complications of life kept down, the bores sifted out, the large ease of the home preserved, {{because of the way the}} others held the field and braved the weather. Amerigo never complained--any more than, for that matter, Charlotte did; but she seemed to see to-night as she had never yet quite done that their business of <b>social</b> <b>representation,</b> conceived as they conceived it, beyond any conception of her own, and conscientiously carried out, was an affair of living always in harness. She remembered Fanny Assingham's old judgment, that friend's description of her father and herself as not living at all, as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them; and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together, one September day at Fawns, under the trees, when she put before him this dictum of Fanny's.|$|E

In line with the theoretical points concerning the defensive function of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> it was predicted that women would have more shared and concrete <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> of sexual maniac and victim than men.

5000|$|There {{have been}} various {{developments}} {{within the field}} since Moscovici's original proposition of the theory. Jean-Claude Abric {{and his colleagues have}} explored the structural elements of <b>social</b> <b>representations,</b> distinguishing between core and peripheral elements in terms of the centrality and stability of certain beliefs. This approach {{has come to be known}} as the central nucleus theory. Saadi Lahlou explores the relations between <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> and behavior, focusing on eating representations and consumer behaviour. [...] Other important developments have been made by Caroline Howarth in linking Social identity theory with the theory of <b>social</b> <b>representations,</b> by Gerard Duveen in elaborating developmental aspects in relation to the micro-genesis of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> of gender, and by Wolfgang Wagner in fathoming the relationship between discursive processes, collective behaviour patterns and the construction of <b>social</b> <b>representations.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>representations</b> {{are formed}} when a {{particular}} object or phenomenon is considered problematic {{by a particular}} group. In {{trying to make sense}} of the object or phenomenon, the group forms socially shared concepts allowing it to become part of the group’s social world. Because of these features, <b>Social</b> <b>Representations</b> Theory has been used extensively in the area of health and illness, particularly in the area of HIV/AIDS and the stigma that surrounds the disease and those affected. However, few researchers have looked to the narrative to examine the social nature of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> and have focused mainly on other methods to explore their internal structure. This article explores history of HIV/AIDS and the early <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> of disease. Narrative analysis is used to determine how the early <b>social</b> <b>representations,</b> particularly the process of objectification, has affected the identities of those recently diagnosed with HIV.

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>representation</b> {{theory is}} popular mainly among European social psychologists.

However, the theory is far from being a settled doctrine as it attracts ongoing debate and controversy from both social representationists and other theorists. The theory is less known in the United States, partly because much of Moscovici's original work has been published in French.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the theory of}} <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> {{as a model of}} social scientific theory. In doing so, it attempts to reconstruct the foundations of the theory of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> by focusing on intellectual resources that were available to Serge Moscovici during the time he was developing the theory. These resources shaped his epistemology, and firmly distinguished the theory of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> from other <b>social</b> psychological approaches. The focus on these intellectual resources draws attention to two issues. First, in contrast to what Moscovici often called ‘one or two sentence theories’ in social psychology based on the manipulation of variables, the theory of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> is built on a rich set of presuppositions. Second, an explicit recognition of presuppositions of <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> in their application in professional practices like education, politics and health, among others, enables a unique contribution to social sciences and humanities...|$|R

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Representation</b> Theory is an {{approach}} that bridges the traditional divide {{between the individual and}} the collective in psychology and the social sciences.

The theory and its development are summarized in Wagner & Hayes’ 2005 monograph.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>social</b> <b>representation</b> theory such contradictions {{highlight}} {{the role of}} representational systems as serving the purpose of relating, social belonging and communication in everyday life.

Both systems of knowledge have their own domain of validity but they are at the same time fluid enough to cross-fertilize each other in dialogical encounters.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>social</b> <b>representation</b> was {{originally}} coined by Serge Moscovici in 1961, {{in his study}} on the reception and circulation of psychoanalysis in France. It is understood as the collective elaboration [...] "of a social object by the community {{for the purpose of}} behaving and communicating". They are further referred to as [...] "system of values, ideas and practices with a twofold function; first, to establish an order which will enable individuals to orient themselves in their material and social world and to master it; and secondly to enable communication to take place among the members of a community by providing them with a code for social exchange and a code for naming and classifying unambiguously the various aspects of their world and their individual and group history". In his study, Moscovici sought to investigate how scientific theories circulate within common sense, and what happens to these theories when they are elaborated upon by a lay public. For such analysis, Moscovici postulated two universes: the reified universe of science, which operates according to scientific rules and procedures and gives rise to scientific knowledge, and the consensual universe of <b>social</b> <b>representation,</b> in which the lay public elaborates and circulates forms of knowledge which come to constitute the content of common sense.|$|E

50|$|Distinct {{from data}} mining and content analysis, {{netnography}} {{as a method}} emphasizes the cultural contextualizing of online data. This often proves to be challenging in the social-cues-impoverished online context. Because netnography is based primarily upon the observation of textual discourse, ensuring trustworthy interpretations requires a different approach than the balancing of discourse and observed behavior that occurs during in-person ethnography. Although the online landscape mediates <b>social</b> <b>representation</b> and renders problematic the issue of informant identity, netnography seems perfectly amenable to treating behavior or the social act as the ultimate unit of analysis, rather than the individual person.|$|E
50|$|Another central {{tenet of}} Wagner’s {{thinking}} is the constructivist unity of a <b>social</b> <b>representation</b> {{and the social}} object it constructs. The object and the thinking and behaviour of a community about it cannot be separated on epistemological grounds. Without a representation, an object would just be a „something“ and it could not take {{its place in the}} life world of a community. Once an issue or object is part of a local world, it is intimately linked with the behaviour and ways of thinking of the people sharing in its representation, such that the object, at the end, is the representation.|$|E

We concluded that tegumentary leishmaniasis is viewed as a wound caused by a mosquito, portrayed by metaphors. The results of the second phase showed that <b>social</b> <b>representations</b> are systems that favor adherence to scientific knowledge, at times more rigidly in the central core, other times more flexibly when linked to the peripheral systems...|$|R
