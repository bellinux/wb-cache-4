The next day, Dorothy frees the Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted {{connections}} of the Tin Woodman, and meets the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages the three of them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in <b>silk</b> <b>gauze,</b> the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E

Jittoku do not have mon. Jittoku originated in the Kamakura period (1185-1333 CE), and by the Edo period (1603-1868) they were worn with kimono by male doctors, monks, Confucian scholars and tea ceremony masters as kinagashi (as a replacement for hakama). In the modern day they are worn as kinagashi mainly by male practitioners of tea ceremony who have achieved a sufficiently high rank.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by weaving, {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or ramie fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate <b>silk</b> <b>gauzes.</b> In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs. A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two mandalas, two monk's surplices or kesa, one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.|$|R

Sacrifices and prayers were offered to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors, hoping {{to ensure a successful}} journey and a safe passage during the voyage. In the autumn of 1405, the treasure fleet had assembled at Nanjing and was ready to depart from the city. According to the Taizong shilu 11 July 1405 entry about the dispatch of the fleet, Admiral Zheng He and [...] "others" [...] departed for the first expedition [...] "bearing imperial letters to the countries of the Western Ocean and with gifts to their kings of gold brocade, patterned silks, and colored <b>silk</b> <b>gauze,</b> according to their status."

Afterwards, the fleet sailed down the Chinese coast, towards the mouth of the Min River, where they awaited the northeast monsoon at Taiping anchorage in the Changle district. More prayers and sacrifices were conducted for Tianfei by the crew during the wait for the northeast monsoon. Afterwards, the fleet departed via the Wuhumen (lit.

With the blue <b>silk</b> <b>gauze</b> lightly tied under his collar, and the lapels of his thin coat thrown back to admit his thumbs to his {{waistcoat}} pockets, he felt almost cheerful before his glass. Should he shave? As once before, this important question occurred to him. His thinness gave him some advantages of figure, but he thought that it made his face older. What effect would cutting off his beard have upon it? He had not seen the lower part of his face for fifteen years. No one could say what recent ruin of a double chin might not be lurking there. He decided not to shave, at least till after dinner, and after dinner he was too impatient for his visit to brook the necessary delay.|$|E

50|$|Relative to {{the overall}} basic cost of living, even simple {{clothing}} was expensive, and was recycled many times down the social scale. Most clothing was simple in structure and basic form, and its production required minimal cutting and tailoring, but all was produced by hand and every process required skill, knowledge and time. Spinning and weaving were thought virtuous, frugal occupations for Roman women of all classes. Wealthy matrons, including Augustus' wife Livia, might show their traditionalist values by producing home-spun clothing, but most {{men and women who}} could afford it bought their clothing from specialist artisans.

6000|$|Colville {{went back}} to his own room, and {{spent a good deal of}} time in the contemplation of a suit of clothes, adapted to the season, which had been sent home from the tailor's just before Mr. Waters came in. The coat was of the lightest serge, the {{trousers}} of a pearly grey tending to lavender, the waistcoat of cool white duck. On his way home from Palazzo Pinti he had stopped in Via Tornabuoni and bought some <b>silk</b> <b>gauze</b> neckties of a tasteful gaiety of tint, which he had at the time thought very well of. But now, as he spread out the whole array on his bed, it seemed too emblematic of a light and blameless spirit for his wear. He ought to put on something as nearly analogous to sackcloth as a modern stock of dry-goods afforded; he ought, at least, to wear the grave materials of his winter costume. But they were really insupportable in this sudden access of summer. Besides, he had grown thin during his sickness, and the things bagged about him. If he were going to see Mrs. Bowen that evening, he ought to go in some decent shape. It was perhaps providential that he had failed to find her at home in the morning, when he had ventured thither in the clumsy attire in which he had been loafing about her drawing-room for the past week. He now owed it to her to appear before her as well as he could. How charmingly punctilious she always was herself! ...|$|E

40|$|Following {{favourable}} {{results from}} a previous study, a large, multicentre, prospective, case-control study was performed to further assess the incidence of bleeding complications after dental extraction in patients taking oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT). Four hundred fifty-one patients being treated with warfarin who required dental extraction were compared with a control group of 449 non-anticoagulated subjects undergoing the same procedure. In the warfarin-treated group, the oral anticoagulant regimen was maintained unchanged, such that the patients had an International Normalised Ratio ranging between 1. 8 and 4, and local haemostatic measures (i. e. fibrin sponges, <b>silk</b> sutures and <b>gauzes</b> saturated with tranexamic acid) were adopted. All the procedures were performed in an outpatient setting. Seven bleeding complications occurred in the OAT group and four in the control group; {{the difference in the}} number of bleeding events between the two groups was not statistically significant (OR= 1. 754; 95 % CI 0. 510 - 6. 034; p= 0. 3727). No post-operative late bleeds requiring hospitalisation and/or blood transfusions were recorded, and the adjunctive local haemostatic measures were adequate to stop the bleeding. The results of our protocol applied in this large, multicenter study show that dental extractions can be performed easily and safely in anticoagulated outpatients without any modification of the ongoing anticoagulant therapy, thus minimising costs and reducing discomfort for patients...|$|R

Two months previously he had lost a portion of wax candle in the urethra (urethral masturbation). He thought it had slipped into his bladder, but said nothing about it. In a short time he began to have bladder irritation. By means of our cystoscopic rongeur the wax candle was easily grasped and removed. Case No. 2, S. S, ag e d sixteen years. Patient admitted that three days before while employing a vinyl tube within the urethra it slipped {{away from him and}} disappeared into the bladder. Shortly after that he began to have miction pain. The cystoscopic,rongeur was introduced without difficulty. We have made the statistical observation from 1917 to 1955 on foreign body in the urinary bladder of 65 cases in our clinic, and of 456 cases in Japan. 1) Difference in Age: The most of patients are ranging in age from 21 to 30 which mark 13 cases (20 %). 2) Difference in Sex : The incidence of vesical foreign body is higher in male than in female, and this ratio is 2. 1 : 1 in our clinic. 3) The list of objects removed from the hu m an bladder is an incredibly varied one. Most of the objects are wax candle, <b>gauze,</b> <b>silk</b> sutures, needles and catheters. 4) By far the most common portal of entry is the urethra (66, 2 % in our clinic, 61. 6 % in Japan). 5) It is more desirable to treat a patient by not surgical procedure tha n by surgical operation (by not surgical 76 % in our clinic, 38. 6 % in Japan) ...|$|R
