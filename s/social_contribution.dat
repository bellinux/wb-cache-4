2500|$|In 1908, the Aromanian {{intellectual}} was propelled to {{high office}} by the Young Turk Revolution and the Second Constitutional Era: the party rewarded his contribution, legally interpreted as [...] "high {{services to the}} State", by assigning him a special non-elective seat in the Ottoman Senate (a status {{similar to that of}} another Young Turk Aromanian, Filip Mișea, who became a deputy). As Zbuchea notes, Batzaria was unqualified for the office, as he was neither forty years old nor a distinguished bureaucrat, and only owed his promotion to his conspiratorial background. By then, Batzaria is said to have also become a personal friend of the new sultan, Mehmed V, and of Education Minister Abdurrahman Şeref, who reportedly shared his reverence for Nicolae Iorga. A regular contributor to Le Jeune Turc and other newspapers based in Istanbul, the Aromanian campaigner was also appointed vice-president of the Turkish Red Crescent, a humanitarian society, which provided him with close insight into the <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> of Muslim women volunteers, and, through extension, an understanding of Islamic feminism.|$|E

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse succcess. She made part of an ensemble cast in Emilio Estevez's drama Bobby (2006), about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination. Stone received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Lindsay Lohan. As a member of the cast, she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture, but won the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast. In December 2006, Stone co-hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway together with Anjelica Huston.

2500|$|Former Minister of the Economy Arnaud Montebourg, a Socialist rebel {{known for}} {{promoting}} [...] "made in France", presented a firmly left-wing project shortly after declaring his candidacy in August 2016. He promised to offer French enterprises preference in bidding, reverse the 2011 tax increases on the French middle class, and repeal {{most of the}} El Khomri labor law while preserving certain [...] "interesting" [...] social protections such as the [...] "right to disconnect" [...] and [...] "personal activity account". Critical of European austerity, he declared that he would defy the requirement to maintain a budget deficit under 3% of GDP and intended to strengthen intelligence services, require six months of civic service, and achieve gender equality. He also proposed €30 billion in spending to stimulate economic growth, lower the general <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) to increase individuals' purchasing power by €800 a year, create 5,000 new posts in hospitals, call a referendum on a new republic, promulgate a law on the separation of banking activities (as Hollande did), impose a European carbon tax, and establish a national anti-terrorism prosecutor.|$|E
2500|$|Feminist {{writers of}} that period, such as Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, started {{to allow for}} the {{possibility}} that women should be able to combine home with outside employment. 1950s’ form of feminism is often derogatorily termed “welfare feminism.” Indeed, many activists went to great length to stress that their position was that of ‘reasonable modern feminism,’ which accepted sexual diversity, and sought to establish what women’s <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> was rather than emphasizing equality or the similarity of the sexes. Feminism in 1950s England was strongly connected to social responsibility and involved the well-being of society as a whole. This often came at the cost of the liberation and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children’s needs, as advocated, for example, by John Bowlby the head of the Children's Department at the Tavistock Clinic, who [...] published extensively throughout the 1950s and by Donald Winnicott who promoted through radio broadcasts and in the press the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.|$|E
60|$|I am {{very clear}} in my mind on this {{perpetual}} need of competition. I admit that upon that turns the practicability of all the great series of organizing schemes that are called Socialism. The Socialist scheme must show {{a system in which}} predominance and reproduction are correlated with the quality and amount of an individual's <b>social</b> <b>contribution,</b> and so far I acknowledge {{it is only in the}} most general terms that this can be claimed as done. We Socialists have to work out all these questions far more thoroughly than we have done hitherto. We owe that to our movement and the world.|$|E
30|$|Public {{economics}} literature highlights two alternative {{definitions of}} the nature of <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> On the one hand, they can represent a deferred salary if the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and <b>social</b> benefits (pensions and unemployment benefits) is high. This is the case of pension systems with defined contributions. On the other hand, they might be considered a regular payroll tax (such as the labour income tax), if the tax-benefit link is weak, {{as is the case in}} many defined-benefit pay-as-you-go pension systems. In this paper we opt for an intermediate position, so <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> would be treated as a particular labour tax whose revenues are partially affected by social security financing. Therefore, we will concentrate on the labour market dynamics to analyse the incidence of <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and, in general, of labour taxes.|$|R
40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>contributions</b> have an {{important}} impact on payroll policy. Also, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> represent a significant budgetary revenue item which can be viewed at the edge between taxation and insurance. <b>Social</b> <b>contributions</b> in Romania experienced many changes which ended in 2008. Nowadays, they are within a long transaction period towards partial externalization of the insurance activity to privately managed funds. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the homogeneity of Romanian social security public scheme using annual data extracted from 2002 - 2009. The main findings reveal that <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> reached the pinnacle of diversification, being too many, some of them with a small contribution rates; fiscal reforms which reduced contribution rates advantaged employers, and state will be interested to externalize this activity as far private sector will be able to assume this responsibility and the budgetary effects are acceptable for the public finance...|$|R
