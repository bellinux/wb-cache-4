50|$|Torilis arvensis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the parsley family known by the common names spreading hedgeparsley, tall sock-destroyer and common <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley.</b> It is native to parts of Europe and it is known elsewhere, such as North America, as an introduced species and a common weed. It grows in many types of habitat, especially disturbed areas. It is an annual herb producing a slender, branching, rough-haired stem up to a meter in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are each divided into several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets up to 6 centimeters long each. The leaflet is divided or deeply cut into segments or teeth. The inflorescence is a wide open compound umbel of flower clusters on long, slender rays. Each flower has five petals which are unequal in size and are white with a pinkish or reddish tinge. Each greenish or pinkish fruit is 3 to 5 millimeters long and is coated in straight or curving prickles.|$|R
50|$|Torilis japonica, the erect hedgeparsley, {{upright hedge-parsley}} or Japanese <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley,</b> is a plant {{species in the}} genus Torilis. Japanese Hedgeparsley is {{considered}} both an annual and biennial plant in the carrot family depending on the biogeographical location. This means Japanese Hedgeparsley can complete its life cycle in either one or two growing seasons depending on habitat. Japanese Hedgeparsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats. It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration. It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading {{a wide range of}} habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation. This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability. Aside from its environmental implications, T. japonica has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.|$|R
50|$|Alternaria Leaf Blight is a foliar {{disease of}} carrots {{caused by the}} fungus Alternaria dauci. Alternaria dauci is {{included}} in the porri species group of Alternaria, which is classified for having large conidium and a long, slender filiform beak. Because many of the members of this group have similar morphology, Alternaria dauci has also been classified as formae specialis of carrots, or A. porri f. sp. dauci. It has been well established that the host range of this disease is on cultivated and wild carrot, but it has also been claimed that Alternaria dauci has the ability to infect wild parsnip, celery, and parsley. A study in 2011 by Boedo et al. evaluated the host range of Alternaria dauci in a controlled environment and concluded that several non-carrot species could constitute alternate hosts, such as Ridolfia segetum (corn parsley) and Caucalis tenet (<b>hedge</b> <b>parsley).</b> Despite their findings, reports of A. dauci colonization on non-carrot hosts continues to be debated because the use of Koch's Postulates on recovered isolates of A. dauci is challenging and is rarely reported; in addition, few reports are often made of such infections in field settings.|$|R

40|$|Hedging {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} topics in finance. How to effectively hedge the exposed risk draws significant interest from both academicians and practitioners. In a complete financial market, every contingent claim can be hedged perfectly. In an incomplete market, the investor can eliminate his risk exposure by superhedging. However, both perfect hedging and superhedging usually call for a high cost. In some situations, the investor does not have enough capital or is not willing to spend that much to achieve a zero risk position. This brings us to the topic of partial hedging. In this thesis, we establish the risk measure based partial hedging model and study the optimal partial hedging strategies under various criteria. First, we consider two of the most common risk measures known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We derive the analytical forms of optimal partial hedging strategies under the criterion of minimizing VaR of the investor's total risk exposure. The knock-out call hedging strategy and the bull call <b>spread</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy are shown to be optimal among two admissible sets of hedging strategies. Since VaR risk measure has some undesired properties, we consider the CVaR risk measure and show that bull call <b>spread</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy is optimal under the criterion of minimizing CVaR of the investor's total risk exposure. The comparison between our proposed partial hedging strategies and some other partial hedging strategies, including the well-known quantile hedging strategy, is provided and the advantages of our proposed partial hedging strategies are highlighted. Then we apply the similar approaches in the context of reinsurance. The VaR-based optimal reinsurance strategies are derived under various constraints. Then we study the optimal partial hedging strategies under general risk measures. We provide the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and use these conditions to study some specific hedging strategies. The robustness of our proposed CVaR-based optimal partial hedging strategy is also discussed in this part. Last but not least, we propose a new method, simulation-based approach, to formulate the optimal partial hedging models. By using the simulation-based approach, we can numerically obtain the optimal partial hedging strategy under various constraints and criteria. The numerical results in the examples in this part coincide with the theoretical results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the basis risk of catastrophic-loss (CAT) index options, which securitize losses from events such as hurricanes and earthquakes. These securities were introduced in response to a surge in the frequency and severity of catastrophic losses and the recognition that global reinsurance markets are not efficient in financing this type of loss. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of CAT index options in hedging hurricane losses for 255 insurers accounting for 93 percent of the insured residential property values in Florida. We simulate hurricane losses using a sophisticated model developed by Applied Insurance Research and measure the basis risk of call <b>spread</b> <b>hedges</b> that settle on a statewide loss index and four intrastate indices. The results show that insurers in the two largest size quartiles can hedge losses almost as effectively using the intra-state index contracts as they can using contracts that settle on their own losses. Many insurers in the third largest size quartile also can hedge effectively using the intra-state indices, but most insurers in the smallest quartile would encounter significant basis risk. A high proportion of the total property exposure in Florida can be hedged efficiently using the intra-state contracts, providing a potential solution to the CAT loss financing problem. Hedging using the statewide loss index is effective only for the largest and most diversified insurers. The Basis Risk of Catastrophic-Loss Index Securities 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{the market}} for credit baskets and single tranche bespoke CDOs keeps growing very rapidly, we witness a lively debate about the merits and {{shortcomings}} of the base correlation model, which is currently the recognized market standard. Difficulties such as the lack of arbitrage-freedom and the witnessed impossibility to calibrate in some market situations are motivations to research a different standard for mark-to-market and risk management. To contribute to this ongoing debate, we describe here a new modeling framework based on a structural, bottom-up approach. Points of interest for this model are {{that it can be}} made consistent with many data sources such as rating transition probabilities, historical default probabilities, single name credit spread curves and equilibrium recovery swap rates. Remarkably enough, we find that the model can be calibrated simultaneously to synchronous datasets for the iTraxx and CDX term structures for tranche spreads across the entire capital structures, including the index basis, and for maturities up to 10 years. The model makes use of an innovative mathematical framework based on spectral analysis and provides numerically noiseless <b>spreads</b> and <b>hedge</b> ratios. As far as execution times are concerned, the model is at least as fast if not faster than the most simplified analytic versions of the base correlation model. 1...|$|R

Optimal hedging and firm value are explicitly linked to firm risk, the type of debt covenants and the relative priority of the hedging contract. It is shown that in some cases hedging is possible only if the counterparty to the forward contract also holds {{a significant portion of the}} debt. Also, the <b>spread</b> in the <b>hedging</b> contract reduces the optimal amount of hedging to less than the minimum-variance hedge ratio. Among other results this article elucidates why some firms hedge using forward contracts while other firms hedge in the futures markets, as well as why higher priority forward contracts are more efficient hedging vehicles.

We also show that, unlike what is commonly assumed, dynamic models do not necessarily perform better than static models, nor do high-dimensional bottom-up models perform better than simpler top-down models. When it comes to hedging, top-down and regression-based hedging with the index provide significantly better results during the credit crisis than bottom-up hedging with single-name credit default swap (CDS) contracts. Our empirical study also reveals that while significantly large moves—“jumps”—do occur in CDS, index, and tranche spreads, these jumps do not necessarily occur on the default dates of index constituents, an observation which shows the insufficiency of some recently proposed portfolio credit risk models. hedging, credit default swaps, portfolio credit derivatives, index default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, portfolio credit risk models, default contagion, <b>spread</b> risk, sensitivity-based <b>hedging,</b> variance minimization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{survey the}} {{theoretical}} and the computational {{problems associated with}} the pricing of spread options. These options are ubiquitous in the financial markets, whether they be equity, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, or energy markets. As a matter of introduction, we present a general overview of the common features of all the spread options by discussing in detail their roles as speculation devices and risk management tools. We describe the mathematical framework used to model them and we review the numerical algorithms used to actually price and hedge them. There is already an extensive literature on the pricing of spread options in the equity and fixed income markets, and our contribution there is mostly to put together material scattered across a wide spectrum of recent text books and journal articles. On the other hand, information about the various numerical procedures which can be used to price and <b>hedge</b> <b>spread</b> options on physical commodities is more difficult to find. For this reason, we make a systematic effort to choose examples from the energy markets in order to illustrate the numeric challenges associated with these instruments. This gives us a chance to venture in the poorly understood world of asset valuation and real options which are the object of a frenzy of active mathematical research. In this spirit, we review the two major avenues to modeling energy prices dynamics, and we explain how the pricing and hedging algorithms can be implemented both in the framework of models for the spot prices dynamics {{as well as for the}} forward curves dynamics. 1...|$|R
