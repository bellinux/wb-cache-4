5000|$|A {{signature}} block (often abbreviated as signature, <b>sig</b> <b>block,</b> sig file, [...]sig, dot sig, siggy, or just sig) is {{a block of}} text automatically appended {{at the bottom of}} an email message, Usenet article, or forum post.|$|E
50|$|The {{form that}} used to {{register}} a site with the Usenet mapping project, before Internet connectivity became commonplace for Usenet sites, included a field for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy. This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of Usenet links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to this as one's ICBM address or missile address, and some people include it in their <b>sig</b> <b>block</b> with that name (but a real missile address would include target elevation).|$|E
5000|$|The Usenet {{standard}} RFC 3676 specifies that {{a signature}} block should be displayed as plain text in a fixed-width font (no HTML, images, or other rich text), {{and should be}} delimited {{from the body of}} the message by a single line consisting of exactly two hyphens, followed by a space, followed by the end of line (i.e., in C-notation: [...] ). This latter prescription, which goes by many names, including [...] "sig dashes", [...] "signature cut line", [...] "sig-marker", [...] "sig separator" [...] and [...] "signature delimiter", allows software to automatically mark or remove the <b>sig</b> <b>block</b> as the receiver desires.

5000|$|New {{possibilities}} {{provided by}} electronic {{means of communication}} gave rise to new types of humor. An early example of these is humorous ASCII art. While the precursor of the ASCII art, the [...] "typewrite art", has been known since 19th century, [...] it was available to few. Whereas ASCII art, including silly one, has become ubiquitous in <b>sig</b> <b>blocks</b> in discussion boards and e-mails. One may find quite a few silly examples in the Jargon File, which also mentions subgenres of ASCII art humor: puns on the letter/character names (e.g., if read [...] "B" [...] as [...] "bee" [...] and the caret character (^) as [...] "carrot", the one may create an ASCII art rebus for a [...] "bee in a carrot patch") and pictures of [...] "silly cows" [...]|$|R
