25|$|Running rigging is {{the rigging}} of a sailing vessel {{that is used}} for raising, lowering, shaping and {{controlling}} the sails on a sailing vessel—as opposed to the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging,</b> which supports the mast and bowsprit. Running rigging varies between vessels that are rigged fore and aft {{and those that are}} square-rigged.|$|E
25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel <b>standing</b> <b>rigging,</b> prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber <b>standing</b> <b>rigging.</b> As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E
25|$|Early sailing vessels used rope of hemp {{or other}} fibers, which {{gave way to}} wire ropes of various types. Galvanized steel was common {{for the first half}} of the 20th century, {{continuing}} as an inexpensive option to its 1960s successor material—stainless steel cables and rods. In the late 20th Century, racing yachts adopted composite fiber lines for <b>standing</b> <b>rigging,</b> with the goal of reducing weight and windage aloft.|$|E
5000|$|In the age {{of wooden}} sailing vessels, a ship's rigging was rope made of hemp, which would rot quickly in such a damp environment. To avoid this, the ropes and cables of the <b>standing</b> <b>rig</b> were soaked in tar, {{which had to be}} {{replenished}} by tarring.|$|R

5000|$|Ketch or Sloop rig with {{aluminum}} spars {{and stainless steel}} <b>standing</b> and running <b>rigging.</b> Main (24m) mast has double aluminum in line spreaders and mizzen mast is with single spreaders. <b>Standing</b> <b>rig</b> with stainless steel wire rope with Norseman swageless terminals and consists of headstay, main backstay, the mizzen forward support is done using intermediate shrouds or a triatic stay, mizzen backstay, single upper shrouds and double lowers on main, single uppers and lowers on mizzen. Main, mizzen and spinnaker booms are aluminum. The original winches were manufactured by Lewmar and Barlow. Swan 65 has two spinnaker poles because gybeing large spinnakers by dipping the pole is considered too dangerous. With only one spinnaker pole operational ADC Accutrac performed gybes by lowering the spinnaker, repacking it and hoisting it up again on the other side. (Clare Francis 1978) ...|$|R
25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging. This is opposed to the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> {{is often}} {{stainless}} steel wire, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid {{stainless steel wire}} {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
25|$|The hull is of {{conventional}} glassfibre construction, {{with a strong}} layup conforming to Lloyd's standards. The two tonnes of lead ballast is encapsulated in the hull, obviating the need for keel bolts. The hull is joined to the deck by a large bulwark, topped with a teak caprail. Unusually, the deck has no balsa core, instead using solid glassfibre construction. Although this makes for greater longevity of the hull {{as there is no}} core to rot or delaminate, a slight 'flex' can sometimes be felt. The mast is keel stepped, and is supported by double lower shrouds for greater redundancy. The <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> terminates at U-bolts in the deck. Although this type of chainplate is sometimes criticised, there is no recorded instance of a dismasting, and Rogers claims reinforcing this system would have no impact on safety. It has the benefit of simplicity and low cost.|$|E

25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>rigging</b> is 1 x 19 {{stainless}} steel wire rope (breaking strength [...] ) with swage terminals, {{stainless steel}} turnbuckles and chain plates. Running rigging is of Samson braid, including jib sheets and main sheet. Halyards are stainless steel having dacron rope tails.|$|E
2500|$|In centuries past, a ship's rigging was {{typically}} fashioned from rope. In the 19th century this was {{commonly referred to}} as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color than the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, running rigging is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> is most often fashioned from stainless steel [...] "wire rope". Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene [...] (UHMWPE) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), Vectran, and Technora.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>rigging</b> {{comprises}} the fixed lines, wires, or rods, which support each mast or bowsprit [...] on a sailing vessel and reinforce those spars against wind loads {{transferred from the}} sails. [...] This term is used in contrast to running rigging, which represents the moveable elements of rigging which adjust the position {{and shape of the}} sails.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial {{solution}} was the Steam Auxiliary Ship - a vessel with a steam engine, but also rigged as a sailing vessel. The steam engine {{would only be}} used when conditions were unsuitable for sailing - in light or contrary winds. Some of this type (for instance Erl King) were built with propellers that could be lifted clear of the water to reduce drag when under sail power alone. These ships struggled to be successful on the route to China, as the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> required when sailing was a handicap when steaming into a head wind, most notably against the southwest monsoon when returning with a cargo of new tea. [...] Though the auxiliary steamers persisted in competing in far eastern trade {{for a few years}} (and it was Erl King that carried the first cargo of tea through the Suez Canal), they soon moved on to other routes.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic indiscipline reigned {{amongst the}} crews: sailors would quit their ships after reviews, or refuse to depart, {{arguing that the}} ships were being sailed {{in order to be}} {{surrendered}} to the British; the municipalities had to intervene and help the Navy convince these sailors to obey. The climate deteriorated to the point that in the night of 6 August, part of Northumberland's <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> was sabotaged. [...] In March, after Jean Bart and Trajan were sent to Vannes, a significant proportion of their crews deserted. In May, in the face of rapid devaluation of the currency, crewmen from the frigates Engageante and Proserpine refused to embark unless they were paid in advance; consequently, on 17 May, 150 men from Proserpine, out of a 260-man complement, failed to report for duty. Some of the crewmen considered their duty to scrutinise their own officers, and regarded themselves, as representative of the French people, to be legitimate sources of authority.|$|E
50|$|During {{the entire}} voyage, Newby {{took part in}} all the work {{required}} to maintain the ship, such as constant chipping of rust, painting and polishing brass and copper and overhauling the <b>standing</b> and running <b>rigging</b> - all of this {{on top of the}} day-to-day tasks required to sail the ship, such as changing from fair weather sails to storm sails and back again as storms rose and abated.|$|R
50|$|A deadeye is an item {{used in the}} <b>standing</b> {{and running}} <b>rigging</b> of {{traditional}} sailing ships. It is a smallish round thick wooden (usually lignum vitae) disc {{with one or more}} holes through it, perpendicular to the plane of the disc. Single and triple-hole deadeyes are most commonly seen. The three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep's skull.|$|R

The tack parrel and tack line can be <b>rigged</b> with either <b>standing</b> or running <b>rigging.</b> The latter, if chosen, will rarely be adjusted.|$|R

60|$|Notwithstanding the repairs, she {{was still}} in a miserable plight. The lower masts were said to be unsound; the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> was much worn; and, in some places, even the bulwarks were quite rotten. Still, she was tolerably tight, and but little more than the {{ordinary}} pumping of a morning served to keep her free.|$|E
5000|$|The British ship's hull, rigging, and sails {{were shot}} to pieces. Holed below the waterline, {{the letter of}} marque took on water at an {{alarming}} rate, and her danger was {{compounded by the fact}} that the American guns had left her with only one operable pump. Trumbull fared little better. Captain of Marines Gilbert Saltonstall subsequently noted: [...] "We were literally cut all to pieces; not a shroud, stay, brace, bowling, or other <b>rigging</b> <b>standing.</b> Our main top must mast shot away, our fore, main mizzen, and jigger masts gone by the board...".|$|R

50|$|After {{more than}} 47 {{years of service}} as a sail and later on as a {{stationary}} training ship she was first laid up in A Graña, Ferrol, her Spanish port of registry. In 1981 the underwater hull was re-plated at the drydock in Ferrol. Later Galatea was completely de-rigged down to a hulk (all yards with <b>standing</b> and running <b>rigging</b> and even the masts removed) and was towed to Seville {{to be used as}} a floating museum, but left forgotten. Some sources even reported that the ship was sunk in the harbour by removing her bronze sea cock valve, but salvaged later by the Spanish Navy.|$|R
60|$|There {{was more}} money in the {{business}} than one knew what to do with. As it extended, I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings, and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort, with ruffles down the forehatch and the running-gear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with a half-turn in the <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> forward of the weather-gaskets. Yes, it was a daisy.|$|E
60|$|Joe nodded, {{and looked}} at the {{approaching}} craft curiously. Though somewhat larger, it was built on about the same lines as the Dazzler which meant, above everything else, that it was built for speed. The mainsail was so large that it was more like that of a racing-yacht, and it carried the points for no less than three reefs in case of rough weather. Aloft and on deck everything was in place--nothing was untidy or useless. From running-gear to <b>standing</b> <b>rigging,</b> everything bore evidence of thorough order and smart seamanship.|$|E

Fair as things now seem, I would give a thousand dollars of a small stock, in which no single dollar has been lightly earned, to see these spars safely on board the Montauk, and snugly fitted to their proper places. Sticks, gentlemen, are to a ship what limbs are to a man. Without them she rolls and tumbles about as winds, currents, and seas will; while with them she walks, and dances, and jumps Jim Crow; ay, almost talks. The <b>standing</b> <b>rigging</b> are the bones and gristle; the running gear the veins in which her life circulates; and the blocks the joints." ...|$|E
