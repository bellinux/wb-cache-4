5|$|Governor Moore {{received}} formal {{notification concerning}} the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia, along with 300 Indians, captured and burned {{the town of}} <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> in the 1702 Siege of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine.</b> The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana.|$|E
5|$|In March 1964, King and the SCLC {{joined forces}} with Robert Hayling's then-controversial {{movement}} in <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine,</b> Florida. Hayling's group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was {{forced out of the}} organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them. King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine,</b> including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested.|$|E

5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Although high {{waves and}} severe northeasterly gusts were noted from 6to 7September 1804 at <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine,</b> Florida and {{eight of the}} nine vessels in the local port were {{rendered}} unfit for use, the town proper largely escaped damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 Mary Ann Channer Davis, who {{had moved}} to <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> {{with her husband in}} 1821, bought the Fornells claim to Key Biscayne from one of the Fornells' heirs for US$100. Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, {{probably}} were aware of plans to build a lighthouse on the Florida coast somewhere between <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> and Key West, and knew that Key Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired land at the southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.|$|E

Belief in the miraculous power of this relic had spread throughout Europe, and it brought many pilgrims to <b>St</b> <b>Augustine's,</b> whose gifts enriched the abbey.|$|R
5|$|The Siege of Pensacola was two {{separate}} attempts in 1707 by English-supported Creek Indians {{to capture the}} town and fortress of Pensacola, one of two major settlements (the other was <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine)</b> in Spanish Florida.|$|E
5|$|When Bob was {{designated}} a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys west of Craig Key, and from Flamingo to Venice. Gale warnings were later posted for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine.</b> Small craft south of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> were advised {{to remain in}} port. While the storm was situated off the east-central coast of Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Savannah, Georgia to Little River, South Carolina. The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning after Bob's intensification to Category 1 status.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars turned from reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of <b>St</b> <b>Augustine,</b> the presence, in the Sistine Chapel of five pagan prophets is not surprising.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1740s, the South Carolina provincial half-galley Beaufort was {{stationed}} in a cove at {{the southern tip of}} Hilton Head to guard against intrusions by the Spanish of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine.</b> The point and cove are named after Captain David Cutler Braddock, commander of the Beaufort. Captain Braddock was a mariner and privateer of note in Colonial times. Earlier, he had been placed in command of the Georgia schooner Norfolk by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and helped chase the Spanish back to <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> after their failed 1742 invasion of St. Simons Island. After relocating to Savannah in 1746, he served two terms in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly while earning a living as a highly active privateer. He drew a well-known chart of the Florida Keys while on a privateering venture in 1756. The chart is in the Library of Congress.|$|E

5|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived {{at the same moment}} and born at approximately the same time.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, a {{separate}} tropical cyclone {{formed in the}} western Atlantic.

No significant damage occurred, though coastal flooding and heavy rainfall that caused a break in an earthen dam were reported along the coast of Georgia.|$|E
