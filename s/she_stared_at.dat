25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E

[...] "How do you think?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me with equal disbelief. [...] "He started his career after the war in Italy [...] I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he was Beethoven." ...|$|E

Patterns in fabric that <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> coming to life, multiplying, and engulfing or expunging her, a process which she has carried into her artistic career and which she calls [...] "self-obliteration". She was reportedly fascinated by the smooth white stones covering {{the bed of the}} river near her family home, which she cites as another of the seminal influences behind her lasting fixation on dots.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him quickly; then shrugged her {{shoulders}} again.|$|E

2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the paper deep in thought.

60|$|She started, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} {{distended}} eyes, and her small mouth was {{open like a}} ring.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him blankly, {{and with}} that vague {{expression}} of puzzlement which irritated whilst it half-frightened him.|$|E
