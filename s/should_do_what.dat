Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and {{want to go back}} to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying that he has been doing a great job for the first time in his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is best for his family.|$|E

In the morning, Samuel was hesitant about reporting the message to Eli, but Eli asked him honestly to recount to him what he had been told by the Lord. Upon receiving the communication, Eli merely said that the Lord <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> seems right unto him.|$|E
25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she sat alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E

He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E
2500|$|Enough is {{a thriller}} film which also details an abusive relationship. Kazan said it's [...] "About the worst {{aspect of the}} male psyche is that males have been taught, traditionally, to expect {{to get what they}} want. Much of the {{problems}} that men have, or the problems that men impose on women, have to do with feeling like they’re entitled, and that women <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> men want." [...] Ryan J. Downey of MTV News said [...] "Is America ready to see its favorite iced-up, well-manicured diva, Jennifer Lopez, all glammed-down and kicking ass as a battered wife?".|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December, T. V. Soong {{arrived in}} Xi'an, and Soong Mei-ling arrived two days later, {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} Chiang's release. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition {{when it became clear}} that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: [...] "In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little." [...] Chiang nodded and said: [...] "Enlai, you were my subordinate. You <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I say." [...] Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.|$|E

2500|$|At home, SpongeBob, still distraught, {{explains}} {{the situation to}} Patrick. Patrick, however, tells him that [...] "being unemployed is the best gig [...] knows." [...] Patrick says that he'll {{come back in the}} morning to introduce SpongeBob to [...] "the unemployed lifestyle." [...] The next morning, the two friends meet up and start SpongeBob's first day of [...] "glorious unemployment," [...] or as Patrick likes to call it, [...] "Fun Employment." [...] Patrick demonstrates the following activities: 1.) Going to Squidward's garden and getting him to throw vegetables at them after ruining some of his flowers, 2.) Taking a [...] "siesta" [...] and 3.) Having a free lunch with friends at Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. Sandy, who is carrying out an experiment in nutrition, is surprised to see SpongeBob there, and tells SpongeBob that he should find a new job after she learns he was fired. After deciding that Sandy is right, SpongeBob thanks Patrick for trying to help him, but points out that while unemployment might be fun for him, SpongeBob needs a job. Patrick is fine with this and tells his best friend that he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he feels is right.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Hitchens {{argued that}} Pullman pursues an anti-Christian agenda, citing an {{interview}} in which Pullman is quoted as saying: [...] "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief." [...] In the same interview, Pullman acknowledges that a controversy {{would be likely to}} boost sales, but continues [...] "I'm {{not in the business of}} offending people. I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we can to increase the amount of wisdom in the world." [...] Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens' brother Christopher Hitchens, author of God Is Not Great, praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one [...] "whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction". However, he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, accusing Pullman of being a [...] "Protestant atheist" [...] for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.|$|E
