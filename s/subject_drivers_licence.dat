50|$|In some countries, e.g. Austria, Finland and Sweden, {{national}} identity cards are fully voluntary and not needed by everyone, as identity documents like <b>driver's</b> <b>licences</b> are accepted domestically. In these countries {{only a minority}} have a {{national identity}} card, since a majority have a passport and a <b>driver's</b> <b>licence</b> and don't need more identity documents. This is so also for Ireland where {{those who have a}} passport and a <b>driver's</b> <b>licence</b> have less need for the passport card.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the driving prohibitions under the Criminal Code, there may be collateral civil consequences. For example, <b>driver</b> <b>licences</b> are issued under provincial law.

50|$|In Canada, <b>driver's</b> <b>licences</b> {{are issued}} by the {{government}} of the province or territory in which the driver is residing. Thus, specific regulations relating to <b>driver's</b> <b>licences</b> vary province to province, though overall they are quite similar. All provinces have provisions allowing non-residents to use licences issued by other provinces and territories, out-of-country licences, and International Driving Permits. Many provinces also allow non-residents to use regular licences issued by other nations and countries. Canadian <b>driver's</b> <b>licences</b> are also valid in many other countries due to various international agreements and treaties.|$|R

40|$|The {{event of}} holding a <b>driver’s</b> <b>licence</b> and listing it on a resume sends {{a signal of}} a {{capacity}} formobility which generally increases the chances of getting a job.

In that profession with a high concentration of women, the simple attribute of a female candidate mentioning a motorcycle <b>driver’s</b> <b>licence</b> on her resume causes her to lose her advantage over a male candidate. The listing of a <b>driver’s</b> <b>licence</b> on a resume is perceived by the employers as a gender-related characteristic.

50|$|Canada is {{a federal}} state, and {{responsibility}} for road safety with respect to drunk driving falls on both Parliament and the provincial legislatures.

It {{is important to note that}} while Parliament may prohibit an accused from driving, in the absence of provincial legislation, this does not affect the validity of the <b>driver's</b> <b>licence</b> of the accused.
