5000|$|Hoard is an {{allocator}} whose goal is scalable {{memory allocation}} performance.

In addition, there is a thread-local cache that can hold a limited number of <b>superblocks.</b> By allocating only from <b>superblocks</b> on the local per-thread or per-processor heap, and moving mostly-empty <b>superblocks</b> to the global heap so they can be reused by other processors, Hoard keeps fragmentation low while achieving near linear scalability with the number of threads.|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{major urban}} renewal {{projects}} began in Huntington. Four square blocks between 3rd Avenue {{and what is}} now Veterans Memorial Boulevard were demolished.

Two square blocks remained a vast parking lot for the greater part of 30 years, bordered by 8th Street, Veterans Memorial Boulevard, 10th Street, and 3rd Avenue, and was nicknamed the <b>Superblock.</b> The inclusion of a Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant on a small corner parcel in the early 1990s was the only development along the <b>Superblock.</b> The urban renewal effort of the past also produced the Radisson Hotel complex along 3rd Avenue, a new Mack and Dave's storefront, and Heritage Station.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{multiprocessor}} and multicore architectures adopt {{shared resources}} to meet increased performance requirements. Adaptive arbiters, such as FlexRay, {{have been adopted}} to grant access to shared resources. While increasing the performance, timing analysis is more challenging {{with this kind of}} arbiter. This paper considers real-time tasks that are composed of <b>superblocks,</b> while <b>superblocks</b> themselves are composed of phases. Phases are characterized by their worstcase computation time on their processing element and their worst-case number of access requests to a shared resource. Resource accesses, such as access to caches or scratchpad memory, are synchronous and cause the processing element to stall until the access is served. Based on dynamic programming, we develop an algorithm that safely derives an upper-bound of the worst-case response time of a phase. The worst-case response time of a task can then be determined for both sequential or time-triggered execution of <b>superblocks.</b> Experimental results are conducted for a real-world application.

25|$|By the 1950s and 1960s, {{the area}} went into decline, {{in line with}} a trend of general urban {{deterioration}} in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by city planner Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the <b>superblock</b> where they stand today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing {{much in the way}} of amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant graft and corruption associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{optimization}} systems store optimized or translated code in software-managed code caches {{in order}} to maximize reuse of transformed code. Code caches store <b>superblocks</b> that are not fixed in size, may contain links to other <b>superblocks,</b> and carry a high replacement overhead. These additional constraints reduce the effectiveness of conventional cache management policies. This dissertation investigates the code cache management problem in dynamic optimization systems and presents three major advances that cover the design space of cache management decisions. Through code cache simulations, we show that a FIFO replacement policy outperforms other traditional policies, as it enables contiguous cache evictions, allows for a simple circular buffer implementation, and results in comparable cache miss rates to LRU. Furthermore, a pseudo-circular FIFO algorithm is presented, which handles the problem of un-deletable cache blocks. An investigation of cache eviction granularities also reveals that evicting more than the minimum number of <b>superblocks</b> from the code cache at a time results i...|$|R
5000|$|The {{site was}} divided into five <b>superblocks,</b> with {{attention}} paid to the site's topography {{and a desire to}} retain as many natural characteristics of the area as possible. The <b>superblocks</b> were delineated by South Barton Street, South Cleveland Street, Sixteenth street, and Edgewood street. There were 590 paved and lined parking spaces along these streets. In the five <b>superblocks,</b> the designers concentrated undulating strings of 661 apartments on 12% of the space, leaving about 47 acres for green space, parks, recreation areas, yards, roads, parking spaces and service. The apartments were spaced around courts, the biggest being the [...] "H" [...] court. Each apartment had a front court and a private back court. The front court elevations were designed with Attic medallions, varying colonial door and window surrounds, porches, shutters, gambrel roofs of slate, dormers, and careful landscaping. The back court elevations are plain and have almost no details. There were 357 one-bedroom, 271 two-bedroom, and 33 three-bedroom apartments.|$|R
