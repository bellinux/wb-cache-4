5|$|Many in Rome <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> {{reconciliation}} with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned {{and sentenced to}} death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> {{to be only}} known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} whether {{they could have been}} exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E

Refloated by the Italians on 1 May 1943, Commandant Teste was {{captured}} by the Germans in September 1943 and sunk again the following year by Allied bombs on 18–19 August 1944. Raised again in February 1945, she was <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> to be repairable and was considered for conversion as an escort or training carrier. The proposals were eventually dropped and the ship {{was used as a}} store ship for U.S.-built equipment until sold for scrap on 15 May 1950.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, scutes {{which were}} found in the Kayenta Formation (Glen Canyon Group) of {{northern}} Arizona, were by Kevin Padian referred to a Scelidosaurus sp., and used to determine that the age of the strata was around 199.6-196.5 million years ago, {{at a time when it}} was <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> that Scelidosaurus harrisonii dated to the early Sinemurian. These scutes established a geographic tie-in between Arizona's Glen Canyon and Europe, where fossils of Scelidosaurus had previously been discovered. Later scientists have rejected the assignment to Scelidosaurus, as the scutes are different in form. In 2014, Roman Ulansky named a new species, S. arizonenesis, based off these specimens. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter identified it as a nomen dubium, instead once again placing the specimens as Thyreophora indet.|$|E

5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E

5000|$|The idea {{represented}} in the title—that thoughts are free—was expressed as early as in antiquity and became prominent again in the Middle Ages, when Walther von der Vogelweide (c.1170-1230) wrote: [...] ("yet <b>still</b> <b>thoughts</b> are free"). In the 12th century, Austrian minnesinger Dietmar von Aist (presumably) had composed the song [...] ("only thoughts are free"). About 1229, Freidank wrote: [...] ("this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine").|$|R

With utmost confidence, enthusiasm and dedication, coupled with blessings from Master Cheng Yen, Brother David Liu later decided to donate {{a piece of land}} adjacent to his factory to Tzu Chi for the purpose of building the Hall of <b>Still</b> <b>Thoughts.</b> On 21 May 1997, the Melaka Tzu Chi <b>Still</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Hall, {{the first of its kind}} in Malaysia, was completed. Master De Xuan from Hualien was invited to visit Melaka and officiate at the Opening Ceremony, and at the same time, upgrade Melaka's Contact Office to a Liaison Office. In June 1998, Melaka Liaison Office was further upgraded to a Tzu Chi Branch Office. Master Cheng Yen sent Brother Steven Huang, the Chief Supervisor of Tzu Chi International Affairs, to Melaka for this purpose. Melaka Branch took charge of Tzu Chi affairs in Central and Southern Peninsular of Malaysia, as well as East Malaysia. In year 2005, Kuala Lumpur became another Tzu-Chi's branch office.|$|R
25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not definitely know that Pickett had withdrawn his force, he <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> Griffin could intercept the Confederates. Griffin moved Chamberlain's brigade at the head of his column in line of battle with great care because Griffin thought they might strike the Confederate force if they emerged from White Oak Road while his division moved toward Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Griffin advanced on Crump Road. With a Confederate counterattack <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> to be possible as Crawford moved, Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road when Warren perceived that the Confederates from the White Oak Road Line were not going to wait for or follow the moving Union division.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{is related to}} the origin of glass as a substitute for gemstones. By borrowing techniques for stone and carved gems, artisans were able to produce a variety of small containers from blocks of raw glass or thick moulded blanks, including cameo glass in two or more colours, and cage cups (<b>still</b> <b>thought</b> by most scholars to have been decorated by cutting, despite some debate).|$|E

25|$|It {{would seem}} {{reasonable}} {{to think that}} the regular spacing and size uniformity of fish in schools would result in hydrodynamic efficiencies. However, experiments in the laboratory have failed to find any gains from the hydrodynamic lift created by the neighbours of a fish within a school, though it is <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> that efficiency gains do occur in the wild. Landa (1998) argues that the leader of a school constantly changes, because while being in the body of a school gives a hydrodynamic advantage, being the leader means you are the first to the food.|$|E
25|$|The French {{were also}} irritated {{that they had}} not been {{consulted}} about the British shipping US infantry and machine gunners to France. Although some American divisions were now serving with the British forces, at the Supreme War Council on 1 May Haig thought Pershing “very obstinate and stupid” for refusing to integrate US troops (1 May) with Allied units (an ironic complaint in view of his reluctance to integrate British troops with French).

25|$|New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) — native but now {{relatively}} uncommon {{since in}} most places the eastern cottontail has replaced it; {{it appears to be}} more common in the west-central and southeastern parts of the state; generally found in shrubby wetlands and forests with dense plant life near the ground. Another possible reason for the decline of this species could be the loss of areas with suitable ground cover, which protects the animals from predators. Loss of farmland to forests is thought to have reduced the population since the 1930s, when New England cottontails were <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> to outnumber eastern cottontails.|$|E
25|$|Haig then {{returned}} to France (13–15 February) to inspect Fifth Army, which was taking over a section of French line.

On 21 February, Monck forced Parliament to readmit members that were purged in December 1648 and it seemed certain that the Commonwealth would stay in power. The tract was written to persuade those who <b>still</b> <b>thought</b> that a monarchy would serve as a better form of government than the one Monck was setting into motion.|$|E
