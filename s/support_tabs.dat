5000|$|The <b>Support</b> <b>tab</b> {{consists}} of: Auxiliary Skills, Item Skills, Ely Skills, and Fight Arena Skills. Auxiliary {{skills are}} skills {{that let you}} get through the game and complete quests. In this tab, there are such skills as Mining, Digging, and Ignite. Item skills are normally pet buffs that you can activate while having a pet equipped. Most players don't use this section, as opening the pet menu allows them to put each pet buff on their hotkeys. Ely skills are skills you can get purely by using Ely. With {{the release of the}} Engineer class line, new skills called [...] "Ely Skills" [...] were introduced into the game. One skill for increasing of the Four Stats: Power, Stamina, Magic, and Luck. These skills are purchased and there is no level requirement. These are somewhat expensive for new players, so they are not a priority. Some skills cannot be unlocked without going to various dungeons to succeed a book that is dropped by the boss. Books that can't be accessed through bosses come from boxes in Fashion Shop that give a random item upon use. The last way to get the remaining skills are through PvP. You have to reach a certain rank in order to trade in PvP points for a book. Fight Arena skills are those that are earned through getting PvP points and trading them in for skills that help counter or fight another player.|$|R

40|$|B cells often {{infiltrate}} the microenvironment of human tumors. B cells can both positively and negatively regulate antitumor immune responses. In several human cancers, higher numbers of CD 20 (+) TAB {{are associated with}} a favorable prognosis, whereas in human primary melanomas, this association is contentious. In this study, we determined the association of TAB numbers in cutaneous primary melanoma tissue samples and patients' overall survival. The CD 20 immunohistochemistry on archival nonmetastasized and metastasized cutaneous primary melanoma tissues from 2 independent patient cohorts was performed. One cohort was used in class comparison for metastasis, the most important prognostic factor for overall survival, and the other cohort for a subsequent survival analysis. Survival association was further validated with RNA data from a third independent cohort. Whole tissue sections were read automatically via quantitative digital imaging and analysis. Survival data were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard modeling. We discovered that cutaneous primary melanomas without metastasis contain significantly more TAB than primary melanomas that had metastasized. At time of first diagnosis, a higher number of TAB is associated with a significantly better overall survival in patients with cutaneous primary melanomas of > 1 mm Breslow depth. Also, higher CD 20 /CD 19 tumor mRNA levels are correlated with a significantly better overall survival. Thus, our data <b>support</b> <b>TAB</b> numbers as a prognostic biomarker in cutaneous primary melanoma patients with a tumor of > 1 mm Breslow depth. For a survey in larger studies, whole tissue section analysis seems to be key to accurate assessment of TAB numbers...|$|R
50|$|The Austrian-Swiss {{cableway}} manufacturer Steurer Seilbahnen created {{two parallel}} single-track twin-cable aerial ropeways which manage {{with a single}} rope span without pylons. There are two rope loops, {{the return of the}} ropes is in each case on the track of the other path. For stabilizing the ropes 17 large <b>supporting</b> cable <b>tabs</b> are used. Two glazed Kuechler design cabins from Gangloff are installed with six automatic doors and a capacity of 150 people each. The hourly transportation capacity is 1,700 persons per direction. At low ridership or technical restrictions the Urdenbahn can be operated with just one car. The emergency passenger evacuating concept includes the use of winches between the two cabins.|$|R
