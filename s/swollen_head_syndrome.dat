Phylogenetic typing showed that commensal and omphalitis strains belonged mainly to phylogenetic Group A and <b>swollen</b> <b>head</b> <b>syndrome</b> to phylogenetic Group D. Septicemic strains were assigned in phylogenetic Groups A and D. These data could suggest that clonal lineage of septicemic APEC strains have a multiple ancestor origin; one from a pathogenic bacteria ancestor and other from a non-pathogenic ancestor that evolved by the acquisition of virulence related sequences through horizontal gene transfer. <b>Swollen</b> <b>head</b> <b>syndrome</b> may constitute a pathogenic clonal group. By the other side, omphalitis strains probably constitute a non-pathogenic clonal group, and could cause omphalitis as an opportunistic infection.

We examined 780 oropharyngeal swab or nasal turbinate samples collected from 130 chicken flocks to investigate the prevalence of aMPV and to isolate aMPV from chickens from 2004 - 2008. Twelve aMPV subtype A and 13 subtype B strains were detected from clinical samples by the aMPV subtype A and B multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). Partial sequence analysis of the G glycoprotein gene confirmed that the detected aMPVs belonged to subtypes A and B. Two aMPVs subtype A out of the 25 detected aMPVs were isolated by Vero cell passage. In animal experiments with an aMPV isolate, viral RNA was detected in nasal discharge, although no clinical signs of SHS were observed in chickens.

The current information on prevalence of aMPV in broiler in Italy is fragmentary and the impact on production remains unknown. In order to draw an epidemiological picture of aMPV in broiler flocks, starting from 2014, a survey has been performed mainly in the highly poultry populated areas in the North of Italy. Swabs collected during one-off and longitudinal studies were tested using A and B subtype specific Real Time RT-PCR.

Thirty commensal strains isolated from poultry with no signs of these illnesses were used as control strains. The purified DNA of these strains produced electrophoretic profiles ranging from 0 to 15 bands with molecular sizes varying from 100 bp to 6. 1 kb, allowing the grouping of the 79 strains into a dendrogram containing 49 REP-types. Although REP-PCR showed good discriminating power it {{was not able to}} group the strains either into specific pathogenic classes or to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. On the contrary, we recently demonstrated that other techniques such as ERIC-PCR and isoenzyme profiles are appropriate to discriminate between commensal and APEC strains and also to group these strains into specific pathogenic classes. In conclusion, REP-PCR seems to be a technique neither efficient nor universal for APEC strains discrimination. However, the population clonal structure obtained with the use of REP-PCR must not be ignored particularly if one takes into account that the APEC pathogenic mechanisms are not completely understood yet...|$|E

40|$|Avianmeta{{pneumovirus}} (aMPV), {{also known}} as avian pneumovirus or turkey rhinotracheitis virus, is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and is associated with <b>swollen</b> <b>head</b> <b>syndrome</b> in chickens. Since its discovery in the 1970 s, aMPV has been recognized as an economically important pathogen in the poultry industry worldwide. The conserved region VI (CR VI) of the large (L) polymerase proteins of paramyxoviruses catalyzes methyltransferase (MTase) activities that typically methylate viral mRNAs at guanine N- 7 (G-N- 7) and ribose 2 =-O positions. In this study, we generated a panel of recombinant aMPV (raMPV) Colorado strains carrying mutations in the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in the CR VI of L protein. These recombi-nant viruses were specifically defective in ribose 2 =-O, but not G-N- 7 methylation and were genetically stable and highly attenu-ated in cell culture and viral replication in {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) young turkeys. Importantly, turkeys vaccinated with these MTase-defective raMPVs triggered a high level of neutralizing antibody and were completely protected from challenge with homologous aMPV Colorado strain and heterologous aMPVMinnesota strain. Collec-tively, our results indicate (i) that aMPV lacking 2 =-O methylation is highly attenuated in vitro and in vivo and (ii) that inhibi-tion of mRNA capMTase can serve as a novel target to rationally design live attenuated vaccines for aMPV and perhaps other paramyxoviruses...|$|E

The majority of AMPV detections were of field origin, circulating mainly from 9 to 12 weeks of age in turkeys and from 5 to 7 weeks of age in broilers, and associated with respiratory symptoms.

The reasons for vaccine failure could be field virus changes in key antigenic regions that allow replication and leading to disease in well vaccinated birds. Our study revealed that VC 03 vaccine strain can be detected in turkeys up to many weeks after vaccination, with a high prevalence in the first weeks after hatch. This confirmed the pattern seen previously for subtype A and B live vaccine which has been shown to persist on farm for 4 - 5 weeks. Uniquely in this study, apparently vaccine derived strains were observed in older turkeys of up to 84 days of age.
