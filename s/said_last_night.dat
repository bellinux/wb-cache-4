2500|$|On March 17, 2008, The Toronto Star {{reported}} {{details from}} Canadians {{caught in the}} violent riots in Tibet. 19-year-old John Kenwood of Victoria, B.C. was witnessing a Chinese motorcyclist being pummelled unconscious by a Tibetan mob hurling chunks of pavement as big as bricks. [...] "He may have died," [...] Kenwood <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> (March 16). [...] "I can't be certain." [...] "He didn't seem {{to understand what was}} going on," [...] said Kenwood. [...] "He was wearing a gold helmet and he got off his bike and raised his arms. He didn't know what to do." [...] Also the report cited Canadian eye-witnesses of how the riots turned violent and how some of them escaped with help from taxi drivers and guides. Another report described in detail how Canadian traveller Justin Winfield from Toronto helped to save a Han Chinese from mobs and took him to a local hospital along with two women.|$|E
2500|$|When the Holiday Bowl chose ASU, the Sun Devils head Coach Dennis Erickson said, [...] "We're {{excited about}} going to the Holiday Bowl. [...] We get to play Texas. That's a great program, a {{historic}} program, and great opportunity for us. As I <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> after the game, we have no control over the BCS; {{all we can do is}} go out there and play football. Which we did a good job of 10 times. That's something that they have to deal with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is. Our players are really excited about going where we're going." [...] Vice President for ASU Athletics Lisa Love said. [...] "Playing a perennial power like the University of Texas, December 27 in the Holiday Bowl, which, by the way, is wonderfully hosted by that committee. This is a great, step forward. This is exactly what we wanted to do. We are very pleased to be mentioned in the same breath as a program like Texas." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, yes!' {{said the}} Doctor; 'Annie's quite well, and she'll {{be delighted to}} see you. You were always her favourite. She <b>said</b> so, <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> when I showed her your letter. And--yes, to be sure--you {{recollect}} Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really believe}} Tom's half sorry he can't do so. He <b>said</b> {{something}} <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that suggested it--I can't remember {{exactly what it}} was. Of course, I don't understand much about these matters, but Howitson was here talking business until late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is it you}} <b>said</b> I was <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> You know," [...] {{he asked}} after some {{preliminary}} talk. [...] "Too--too--I don't know. A very funny word." ...|$|R
6000|$|BARTHWICK. [Portentously.] This young--er--lady {{says that}} last night--I think you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> madam--you took away---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are unusually enthusiastic, cousin," [...] said Emma, with a laugh. [...] "I {{thought you}} <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that weather never {{affected}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S.--You <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> you {{positively}} declined {{adding another}} item to your account with me; don't you think I've saved you that trouble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly, {{but one can}} use one's eyes, I suppose. He <b>said</b> nothing <b>last</b> <b>night</b> {{about going}} away, {{and now he is}} leaving by this afternoon's coach; besides, {{although}} he laughed and talked as usual one could see with half an eye that it was forced. So you have actually refused him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{less that}} is <b>said</b> about <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> the better, but I can't pass over it without expressing our {{gratitude}} for the position you took," [...] she said. [...] "Harry has driven Jernyngham out in the sleigh--he {{has been in a}} curious limp state all morning--and Gertrude has not yet got over the shock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not quite}} the thing," [...] he <b>said.</b> [...] "Late, <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I suppose. I'm sure it's very {{good of you to}} think of me, Speedwell, but I'd rather you left me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{brought him}} {{straight}} round. [...] "Ah there you are! It's what I <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> to Chad. That he himself, I mean, has none." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is pretty}} nice. You can come if Demi don't mind, and I guess he won't, because he <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> {{that he liked}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes you}} say queer things," [...] said the Captain, looking Altamont {{hard in the}} face. [...] "Remember what you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> at Clavering's table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have not}} {{forgotten}} what I <b>said</b> to you <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> My father's name is Numerian. He {{lives on the}} Pincian Mount. You will save him, Hermanric--you will save him! You will remember your promise!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} too much spirit to show I was hurt, though," [...] cries Hetty, {{clenching}} her little fists. [...] "And I would smile, though that horrible old painted woman boxed my ears. She is horrible, mamma. You think so yourself, Theo! Own, now, you think so yourself! You <b>said</b> so <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and acted her coming in on her crutch, and grinning round to the company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{him tell}} his story. I am certain {{he has spoken}} nothing but the truth, for he <b>said</b> to me <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that he had twice asked for the money, and was going this morning for the third time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over what you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> Colonel, and with your permission I am resolved to make an attempt to bring about Nana's release." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} papa {{is not quite}} pleased about our engagement," [...] Rosamond continued, almost in a whisper; [...] "and he <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that he should {{certainly}} speak {{to you and say}} it must be given up." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} Lemuel stopped Miss Swan {{at the door}} of the breakfast room, and said, [...] "I've been {{thinking}} over what you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and I should like to bring some one--a lady friend of mine--to see the pictures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I be back again?--No, I {{could not}} be back again then; besides, Feemy, I wouldn't be married in this place after what your brother and Father John <b>said</b> to me <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> If {{we are to be}} married at all, it can't be here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gene, I could sure swear at you or {{any other}} pig-head of a cowboy. Listen. My brother-in-law, Jack, heard {{something}} of what I <b>said</b> to you <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> He doesn't like you. I'm afraid he'll tell Al. For Heaven's sake, man, go down-town and shut him up and yourself, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever Guy {{may have}} said, you are quite mistaken. There's a mystery somewhere. Keep his letter and {{show it to}} me. I may, perhaps, be able to unravel the tangle. I'm more than ever {{convinced}} that what I <b>said</b> to you <b>last</b> <b>night</b> was perfectly true. We will save him yet. Unalterably, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> {{that you thought}} the world a very stupid, grown-up place, {{because there were no}} giants and fairies in it now? Well, perhaps there are fairies, {{and they are going to}} show themselves to you, if you watch well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} no {{conception}} how unhappy I am about it. Of course Lady Fawn will tell me to go away. I went out on purpose to beg his pardon for what I <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and I just said the very same thing again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is ever thus," [...] said Sanchez, sententiously; [...] "it {{is what he}} <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> when I {{picked him}} up on the mound. He will sleep now--thou shalt see. He will get no further than Koorotora and the coyote--and then he will sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I {{have been}} {{spending}} {{a week with}} the Bartons," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>last</b> <b>night</b> I came over from their house to the station in a carriage. There is a connecting train, but I should have had to take it {{very early in the}} evening, so I saved time by hiring a carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be what my Lady Queensberry <b>said</b> we were <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> To {{be what we}} are! You {{know the}} word for it!" [...] cried the indignant old woman. [...] "I say, {{what has come to}} the whole race? Your father's mother was an honest woman, Maria. Why did I leave her? Why couldn't you remain so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Barker, I {{thank you}} for what you <b>said</b> to me <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> You were right and I was wrong. I was ungrateful, and ungenerous. I can only say that it was a very sore subject, and that in my {{surprise}} I thought of the past, and not the present. Believe me, I am very sorry for what I said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a solicitor; are you? and you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> you was commercial! Will you be {{good enough}} to tell us, Mr. Solicitor--for I didn't just catch your name, except that it begins with a dock--and that's where most of your clients are to be found, I suppose--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{count on}} me, and on Charles," [...] said my Lord, generously; [...] "and {{there are some}} others I know of. Gad! You made a dozen of friends and admirers by what you <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> Richard. And his Grace has a few enemies. You will not lack support." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to bury them," [...] he said, [...] "you had best look sharp, or they may clear out of the country. You {{remember}} what I <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> Just {{look at the top}} of that 'ere hillock, and tell me whether I was in the right or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I never did!" [...] she remarked. [...] "But I <b>said</b> to John <b>last</b> <b>night</b> that I pitied them at sea. He's {{been washed}} {{up by the}} tide, I suppose, and I count there'll be more before the day's out. A year come next September there was six of 'em, gentlefolk, too, who'd been yachting. Eh, but it's a cruel thing is the sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps I don't {{mean that}} exactly," [...] I answered, {{sitting on the}} edge of the table, and {{thrusting}} my hands deep down into my trousers pockets, with the uncomfortable sensation that I was making a fool of myself. [...] "I was judging from what you <b>said</b> you were <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> If study has only brought you to pessimism, I would rather be ignorant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{beginning}} of art,' <b>said</b> Mr. Cobden-Sanderson <b>last</b> <b>night</b> in his charming lecture on Bookbinding, 'is man {{thinking about the}} universe.' He desires to give expression to the joy and wonder that he feels at the marvels that surround him, and invents a form of beauty through which he utters the thought or feeling that is in him. And bookbinding ranks amongst the arts: 'through it a man expresses himself.' ...|$|R
