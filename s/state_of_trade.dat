60|$|In our {{inquiry into}} the laws of {{international}} trade, we commenced with the principles which determine international exchanges and international values on the hypothesis of barter. We next showed that the introduction of money, as a medium of exchange, makes {{no difference in the}} laws of exchanges and of values between country and country, no more than between individual and individual: since the precious metals, under the influence of those same laws, distribute themselves in such proportions among the different countries of the world as to allow the very same exchanges to go on, and at the same values, as would be the case under a system of barter. We lastly considered how the value of money itself is affected by those alterations in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> which arise from alterations either in the demand and supply of commodities or in their cost of production. It remains to consider the alterations in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> which originate not in commodities but in money.|$|E

Friendly arrangements were preferable with all who would come into them, and we should carry into such arrangements all the liberality and spirit of accommodation which the nature of the case would admit.

60|$|I {{will first}} {{refer you to}} Mr. Barlow's account of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Your Lordships will there find a full {{exposure}} of the total falsehood of the prisoner's assertions.

Your Lordships may there see the madness and folly of tyranny attempting to regulate trade. In the printed Minutes, page 2830, your Lordships will see how completely Mr. Hastings had ruined the trade of the country. You will find, that, wherever he pretended to redress the grievances which he had occasioned, he did not take care to have any one part of his pretended redress executed. When you consider the anarchy in which he states the country through which he passed to have been, you may easily conceive that regulations for the protection of trade, without the means of enforcing them, must be nugatory.|$|E
60|$|To {{the ancients}} the Mediterranean was the ocean; and among its bays, and creeks, and islands, {{maritime}} enterprise sprang into being and rose into celebrity. Among the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, and Hebrews, {{we find the}} earliest traces of navigation and commerce. The first of these nations, occupying the narrow slip of land between Mount Lebanon and the Mediterranean, rose into fame as mariners between the years 1700 and 1100 before Christ--the renowned city of Sidon being their great sea-port, whence their ships put forth to trade with Cyprus and Rhodes, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, Gaul, and Spain. Little is known of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in those days, or of the form or size of ancient vessels.

60|$|Let not the reader, however, hastily {{conclude}} that the traders cheated the Indians in this traffic, though the profits were so enormous. The ring or the axe was indeed a trifle to the trader, but the beaver-skin and the horse were equally trifles to the savage, who could procure {{as many of them}} as he chose with very little trouble, while the ring and the axe were in his estimation of priceless value. Besides, be it remembered, to carry that ring and that axe to the far distant haunts of the Red-man cost the trader weeks and months of constant toil, trouble, anxiety, and, alas! too frequently cost him his life! The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> is considerably modified in these regions at the present day. It is not more justly conducted, for, in respect of the value of goods given for furs, it was justly conducted then, but time and circumstances have tended more to equalise the relative values of articles of trade.|$|E
60|$|While the French {{were thus}} bound, and the British free, I always thought {{we must be}} in a {{condition}} to trade to advantage, or it must be our own fault.

But {{that it was my}} opinion that we might carry on a trade with France to our great advantage, and that we ought for that reason to trade with them, appears in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes of the Review, above nine years before the Mercator was thought of. It was not thought criminal to say so then; how it come to be villanous to say so now, God knows; I can give no account of it.

6000|$|... "The ancients divided time," [...] {{said the}} {{somewhat}} pertinacious commentator, [...] "into years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and moments, as they divided numbers into units, tens, hundreds, thousands, {{and tens of}} thousands; and both with an object.

Missing an hour, therefore, is somewhat like dropping an important figure in a complex calculation, and the whole labor may be useless, for want of punctuality in one, as for want of accuracy in the other.
