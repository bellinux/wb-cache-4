We present a <b>sequential</b> algorithm for <b>processing</b> such queries, but observe that any <b>sequential</b> top-k query <b>processing</b> strategy is bound to require unnecessarily long query processing times, since web accesses exhibit high and variable latency. Fortunately, web sources can be probed in parallel, and each source can typically process concurrent requests, although sources may impose some restrictions on the type and number of probes {{that they are willing to}} accept. We adapt our <b>sequential</b> query <b>processing</b> technique and introduce an efficient algorithm that maximizes sourceaccess parallelism to minimize query response time, while satisfying source-access constraints...|$|R

30|$|To {{examine the}} basic perceptual {{processing}} of cognitively and algorithmically fused imagery, we applied SFT. The SFT framework supplies information about important cognitive properties including workload capacity, independence, architecture, and the stopping rule. Workload capacity {{refers to the}} change in the processing rate of information of an individual sensor when going from single- to multi-sensor presentation. Independence {{is the degree to which}} the processing of each type of sensor information influences the processing of the other. Architecture refers to whether processing is simultaneous (parallel <b>processing),</b> <b>sequential</b> (serial <b>processing),</b> or information is pooled (coactive processing). The stopping rule refers to whether one or both sensors must be finished processing when a response is made (e.g., OR or AND).|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the {{combination}} of laser irradiation with atmospheric pressure plasmas, {{also referred to as}} laserâ€“plasma hybrid technology, {{turned out to be a}} powerful technique for different materials processing tasks. This chapter gives an overview on this novel approach. Two methods, simultaneous and <b>sequential</b> laser-plasma <b>processing,</b> are covered. In the first case, both the plasma and the laser irradiation are applied to the substrate at the same time. Depending on the process gas and the discharge type, the plasma provides a number of species that can contribute to the laser process plasma-physically or plasma-chemically. <b>Sequential</b> plasma-enhanced laser <b>processing</b> is based on a plasma-induced modification of essential material properties, thus improving the coupling of laser energy into the material during subsequent laser ablation. Simultaneous plasma-assisted laser processing allows increasing the efficiency of a number of different laser applications such as cleaning, microstructuring, or annealing processes. <b>Sequential</b> plasma-assisted laser <b>processing</b> is a powerful method for the processing of transparent media due to a reduction in the laser ablation threshold and an increase in the ablation rate at the same time. In this chapter, the possibilities, underlying mechanisms, performance, and limits of the introduced approaches are presented in detail...|$|R

5000|$|Tools that {{correctly}} read [...]ZIP archives must scan {{for the end}} {{of central}} directory record signature, and then, as appropriate, the other, indicated, central directory records.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "Data Management" [...] {{arose in the}} 1980s as {{technology}} moved from <b>sequential</b> <b>processing</b> (first cards, then tape) to random access processing. Since it was now technically possible to store a single fact in a single place and access that using random access disk, those suggesting that [...] "Data Management" [...] {{was more important than}} [...] "Process Management" [...] used arguments such as [...] "a customer's home address is stored in 75 (or some other large number) places in our computer systems." [...] During this period, random access processing was not competitively fast, so those suggesting [...] "Process Management" [...] was more important than [...] "Data Management" [...] used batch processing time as their primary argument. As applications moved into real-time, interactive applications, it became obvious to most practitioners that both management processes were important. If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process wasn't well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interpreter}} {{does not}} need to be unduly complex, or produced by a programmer with the advanced knowledge of a compiler writer, and can be written just as any other application program - except that it is usually designed with efficiency in mind. Its primary function is to [...] "execute" [...] the table entries as a set of [...] "instructions". There need be no requirement for parsing of control table entries and these should therefore be designed, as far as possible, to be 'execution ready', requiring only the [...] "plugging in" [...] of variables from the appropriate columns to the already compiled generic code of the interpreter. The program instructions are, in theory, infinitely extensible and constitute (possibly arbitrary) values within the table that are meaningful only to the interpreter. The control flow of the interpreter is normally by <b>sequential</b> <b>processing</b> of each table row but may be modified by specific actions in the table entries.|$|E
