In the {{centrifuge}} of the multi-parameter combined environmental testing device, the three-phase induction motor {{could not be}} started directly at the frequency of 50 Hz due to the large moment of inertia of {{the centrifuge}} rotor. Therefore, large torque output of the three-phase induction motor was required at low frequencies. And the specimen needed <b>stepless</b> rotational <b>speed</b> adjustment (40 - 130 r/min).

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} {{evidence shows}} that the potential for whiplash injury varies with both the average acceleration and <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> of a rear-end collision. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine the gradation of neck muscle responses and the head and neck kinematics to rear-end collision pulses in which the acceleration and <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> were independently varied. Thirty subjects (15 F, 15 M) underwent 36 consecutive rear-end collisions consisting of three different average accelerations (a = 0. 5, 0. 9 and 1. 3 g) and three different <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> (Δv = 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 m/s). Onset and amplitude of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and cervical paraspinal (PARA) muscle responses were measured using surface electromyography. Kinematic measures included linear and angular accelerations and displacements of the head and torso. The results showed that the amplitude of the muscle and kinematics responses was graded to both collision acceleration and <b>speed</b> <b>change.</b> The magnitude of early peaks in the head/neck kinematics correlated more strongly with collision acceleration (r^sup 2 ^ = 0. 63 to 0. 69), whereas the magnitude of later kinematic peaks correlated more strongly with collision <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> (r^sup 2 ^ = 0. 59 to 0. 95). Onset of the SCM muscle response correlated only weakly with collision acceleration and <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> (r^sup 2 ^ ≤ 0. 07). A collision pulse descriptor obtained by multiplying average acceleration and <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> (aDgr;v) yielded the strongest and most consistent correlations with neck muscle (r^sup 2 ^ = 0. 48 to 0. 58) and head/neck kinematic responses (r^sup 2 ^ = 0. 78 to 0. 94).

40|$|Neurons in the mediotemporal {{area of the}} macaque (MT) {{respond to}} {{accelerations}} of visual stimuli with a high transient increase in firing rate that decays to a markedly lower reponse plateau after a few hundred milliseconds. The latency of this transient response correlates with reaction time in tasks requiring the detection of such changes. However, it remains unknown how the sign, the amplitude and the latency of transients in MT generally depend on the sign {{and the size of}} a <b>speed</b> <b>change,</b> and how this interacts with a neuron's tuning to absolute speeds. Moreover, it has never been adressed whether such transients may explain <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> detection at a behavioral level. By characterizing the representation {{of a wide range of}} positive and negative <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> in MT of awake and behaving macaques, this thesis obtains three major findings: First, neuronal transients do not only depend on the absolute speed after a <b>speed</b> <b>change,</b> but are scaled in such a way that their relative amplitudes systematically reflect the size of the <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> itself. For each neuron, this scaling increases with the distance of a <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> from its preferred speed, and depends on its transient-sustained-ratio as a measure of the extent to which it is subject to short-term adpatation within the local ciruitry of MT. Second, simulations in the framework of signal-detection-theory demonstrate that the detection rates of human observers under similar conditions can be reproduced by a physiological detection model that applies an upper and lower threshold, respectively, to positive and negative population transients of a moderate number of MT neurons. Third, the latency of the transient responses is found to mirror the pattern of reaction times in detection tasks, and fullfills predictions of a psychophysical model of motion detection by its dependence on the the absolute value of a <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> and an incomplete normalization for higher base speeds. Because of this close relation between the neuronal representation and measures of detection behavior, this thesis draws the conclusion that neuronal transients in MT are systematically shaped to facilitate the detection of <b>speed</b> <b>changes</b> by the application of a simple threshold mechanism to the population response. It highlights yet another functional purpose of adaptation and presents a framework for future analyses of the detection of changes in other motion or stimulus domains...|$|R
