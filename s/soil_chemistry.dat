25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> can be {{dramatically}} {{changed when}} base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum).|$|E
25|$|One {{theory of}} {{bottom-up}} control lies with differential <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased salinity and acidity stress - soils oxidize under freshwater or tidal moisture limitation, leading to increased acidity. Hypersalinity has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005). However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).|$|E

50|$|The {{manifestation of}} dryland {{salinity}} {{is largely a}} problem of groundwater - however the accumulation of salt within the soil and at the surface due to proximity to or saturation by saline groundwater causes changes to the <b>soil’s</b> <b>chemistry,</b> structure and stability, and the plant life that it supports.|$|R
50|$|In soil, {{tungsten}} metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion. It can be selectively or non-selectively imported by some prokaryotic {{organisms and}} may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes. Its {{effect on the}} action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive. The <b>soil's</b> <b>chemistry</b> determines how the tungsten polymerizes; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates.|$|R
25|$|Flooding {{can bring}} {{significant}} sediments to an alluvial plain. While this effect {{may not be}} desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a floodplain is a natural process that can rejuvenate <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> through mineralization.|$|E

2500|$|A {{mycorrhiza}} (from Greek μυκός mykós, [...] "fungus", and ῥίζα rhiza, [...] "root"; pl. mycorrhizae or mycorrhizas) is {{a symbiotic}} association between a fungus and {{the roots of}} a vascular host plant. The term mycorrhiza refers {{to the role of}} the fungi in the plants' rhizosphere, its root system. Mycorrhizae play important roles in soil biology and <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry.</b>|$|E
40|$|A field {{monitoring}} {{study was}} carried out to follow the changes of fine root morphology, biomass and nutrient status in relation to seasonal changes in <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry</b> and moisture regime in a mature Scots pine stand on acid soil. Seasonal and yearly fluctuations in soil moisture and <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry</b> have been observed. Changes in soil moisture accounted {{for some of the}} changes in the <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry.</b> The results showed that when natural acidification in the soil occurs with low pH (3. 5 - 4. 2) and high aluminium concentration in the soil solution (> 3 - 10 mg l(- 1)), fine root longevity and distribution could be affected. However, fine root growth of Scots pine may not be negatively influenced by adverse soil chemical conditions if soil moisture is not a limiting factor for root growth. In contrast, dry soil conditions increase Scots pine susceptibility to soil acidification and this could significantly reduce fine root growth and increase root mortality. It is therefore important to study seasonal fluctuations of the environmental variables when investigating and modelling cause-effect relationships...|$|R

2500|$|In soil science, {{hydrology}} {{and agricultural}} sciences, water content {{has an important}} role for groundwater recharge, agriculture, and <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry.</b> [...] Many recent scientific research efforts have aimed toward a predictive-understanding of water content over space and time. Observations have revealed generally that spatial variance in water content tends to increase as overall wetness increases in semiarid regions, to decrease as overall wetness increases in humid regions, and to peak under intermediate wetness conditions in temperate regions [...]|$|E
2500|$|Deforestation {{is also a}} large {{conservation}} {{concern because}} Igapó forests are characterized by slow tree growth due to low soil nutrient content and high soil acidity. Despite low nutrient availability, Igapó and other floodplain forests can be biodiverse with some partially endemic species. Due to <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> and seasonal inundation, trees and other resources tend to grow back more slowly after harvest by humans than in other types of Amazonian forests, [...] Accordingly, igapó forests cannot sustain timber harvest. For the future, igapó forests should be fully protected from logging and deforestation because of the low productivity found in them.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{attributed to}} the link between different soil conditions and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in soil conditions associated with die-off. Second, attributing causation with changing soil conditions and die-off is potentially dubious. Reverse causality is a potential explanation; that is, <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry</b> differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered root or evaporation dynamics due to die-off (Marsh 2007).|$|E
40|$|A simple soil {{acidification}} model {{was applied to}} evaluate the effects of sulphur and nitrogen emission reductions on the recovery of acidified European forest soils. In addition we included the {{effects of climate change}} on <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry,</b> by modelling temperature effects on soil chemical processes and including temperature and precipitation effects on nitrogen uptake and on leaching. Model results showed a strong effect of the emission reduction scenarios on <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry.</b> Using the Current Legislation (CLE) scenario, the forest area in Europe with soil solution Al/Bc > 1 mol mol(- 1) (a widely used critical limit) decreased from about 4 % in 1990 to about 1. 7 % in 2050.

2500|$|Heavy metals {{are well}} known toxic agents for living organisms. [...] High soil {{concentrations}} of heavy metals such as zinc, copper, cadmium, lead, nickel, and chromium affect basic metabolic processes {{and can lead to}} cell damage and death. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are susceptible to heavy metal contamination. However, there seems to be widespread heavy metal tolerance in these fungi, with many species having the ability to colonize soils both with and without high heavy metal content. This said, there are a few examples of ecotypes associated with harsh <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry,</b> indicating such inhospitable soils can lead to fungal evolutionary change.|$|E
2500|$|Fungi {{have been}} found in every habitat type in the Wombat Forest. [...] Like animals and plants, fungi have {{preferences}} for different habitats; some grow only on fallen wood, others on animal faeces, some at the base of particular tree species, in moss beds or forest floor humus, some occur only after fires, and others are found in dry bare earth. [...] Many fungus species fruit between late summer and early winter, depending on temperature, rainfall and various other environmental factors such as <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry.</b> [...] Fire also plays a role in triggering the fruiting of some fungi. [...] Furthermore, fungi provide an important food source for many of the Wombat Forest's animals including mammals, birds, reptiles and invertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|Theophilus {{recommends}} {{the use of}} beech logs, which analysis has shown has {{a high proportion of}} CaO when grown on calcareous soil. [...] Whatever wood is used, the amount of potash and CaO it provides, as well as other components that might affect colour and opacity, varies considerably with the age and part of the tree, <b>soil</b> <b>chemistry,</b> climate, {{the time of year when}} the tree was cut and the dryness of the wood when burned, factors over which the glassmaker had little control. This variability explains the problems that glassmakers had in trying to produce glass of a consistent quality. Large amounts of ash would have to be prepared and mixed together to give the homogeneity needed to give a predictable glass composition. A typical yield of ash from beech is only about 1%, so using Theophilus' recipe of two parts of sand to one part of ash means it would take 63kg of beech wood to produce one kilo of glass. It has been estimated that, including fuel, 150–200kg of wood would be needed per kilo of glass.|$|E

For all models this chapter shows examples of site-scale applications at intensively monitored forested plots in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Norway, illustrating the adequacy of the model behaviour. Impacts of legislated emission reductions and forest harvest scenarios on <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry</b> are illustrated with a MAGIC model application. Besides scenario analyses, dynamic models {{can also be used to}} determine target loads, i. e. the deposition to reach a prescribed condition within a given time frame.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in Papers I to IV illustrate {{the importance of}} soil moisture in <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry</b> and response of native plants to the changes induced by change in moisture regime. With the help of glasshouse experiments I tried to study the influence of different treatments of soil moisture conditions on the mineral uptake by native plants of calcareous soil. I also tried to find the correlation between response of the studied species to soil moisture and their field conditions on Öland. Change in moisture level in the soil influenced plant nutrition, which was relevant both {{in the field and}} in the greenhouse. I studied different soil moisture conditions held at constant level and also wet/dry fluctuations. Soil moisture {{had a profound effect on}} pH and concentrations of several ions like HCO 3, Ca, Mg, K, P, Mn, Zn. Soil moisture affects mineral uptake directly by changing soil solution concentrations of certain ions, such as Ca, Mg, K, or indirectly by changing pH and HCO 3. Bicarbonate and pH increased with increasing soil moisture, being closely correlated to each other. I observed increase in solubility of P and Mn with increasing moisture level, elements that are considered as limiting factors on calcareous soil. Zinc concentration in soil solution was adversely affected by increasing soil moisture. It is concluded that variation in soil moisture can influence the distribution of dry and wet growing species by affecting <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry.</b> Plants responded more or less according to their field conditions. The studies {{presented in}} my thesis indicated that soil moisture plays an important role, influencing <b>soil</b> solution <b>chemistry</b> and nutrient uptake by plants...|$|R

40|$|A cosmic-ray soil {{moisture}} probe is usually calibrated locally using soil samples collected within its support volume.
