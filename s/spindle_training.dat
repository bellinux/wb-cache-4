Optimizing {{relationships}} between growth and fructification processes in apple, {{in order to}} obtain high and quality yields every year, is a permanent concern of the fruit research. The relationship between apple trees training systems in „Gala‟, Pinova‟ ‚ „Topaz ‟ and „Florina ‟ apple cultivars, grafted on M 9 rootstocks, in the first 5 years of cropping under the climatic conditions of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, was studied. In the experimental field some growth parameters (trunk cross-sectional area, tree height, length of annual shoots) and fructification (yield in the end of first year of vegetation, cumulative yield for the first 5 years of fructification) were observed. The studied cultivars had a different behaviour, on hand, due to the genetic characteristic of each one and on the other hand, due to the training system of the trees. The results showed that Slender spindle and Vertical axis transmit much strongly growth than Solaxe and Tall <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> systems. The biggest average trunk cross sectional area with the Tall <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> system was obtained (33. 4 cm 2) and also the highest trees (361. 8 cm). Tall spindle gave precocity and the best yield potential compared to the all others cultivars, followed by Solaxe. Tall <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> system proved to be, besides the other technological works, the best ones regarding the all performances of high density apple orchards...|$|E
40|$|In pear, fruit {{ripening}} is not homogeneous, {{which leads}} to problems in harvest and storage management. To identify factors affecting the ripening homogeneity, structural, biochemical and molecular parameters were investigated. Fruits were sampled from trees trained with three different systems, spindle, V-shaped and bi-axis, and were further grouped {{on the basis of}} canopy position (top or bottom) and branch type (short-old-spurs, 3 -year-old or older branches, 2 -year-old branches and twigs). This study confirmed that the position in the canopy plays a crucial role in fruit ripening in V-shaped and bi-axis training systems. Fruit on the <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> system was unaffected by the position of the canopy, albeit showing a large variability within the fruit of each part of the canopy. Such variability is much lower in the bi-axis and V-shaped systems. The <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> system had no similarity in homogeneity indices between the molecular and physiological measurements. Partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) showed differences in training system, branch type and canopy position separated by the different physiological and molecular parameters. Short-old-spurs and twigs had the highest homogeneity and least variability in all training systems and branch types. In addition, partial least square path modelling (PLS-PM) was able to identify a high correlation between physiological measurements and ripening compared to that of molecular dat...|$|E
40|$|T {{here has}} been a steady {{increase}} intree planting density over the last 50 years from 35 trees/acre to, in some cases, more than 2, 500 trees/acre. Some experimental orchards have used densi-ties up to 4, 000 trees/acre. During the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s the Slender <b>Spindle</b> <b>training</b> system (Wertheim, 1968) {{was the most common}} system in Northern Eu-rope, while the Vertical Axis (Lespinasse, 1980) was more common in Southern Eu-rope, North America, and New Zealand. In the 1990 ’s a few growers planted the very high density Super Spindle system (Nuberlin, 1993) with greater than 2, 000 trees/acre. By the late 1990 ’s an amalgam-ation of these three systems gave rise to a new system we began calling the Tall Spindle system. Development of th...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on Topaz, Cooper 39 and Muscat apple cultivars grafted on M 27 {{rootstocks}} under Tokat ecological conditions during 2008 - 2010. The trees planted in 2. 0 m x 0. 5 m row spacing (10, 000 trees ha- 1) and <b>trained</b> to super <b>spindle</b> (SS) <b>training</b> system. The vegetative development, yield and fruit quality performances of the trees supported by wire – pole combination were observed for three years. At {{the end of the}} experiment, it was determined that Cooper 39 had a higher trunk cross sectional area (TCA) than Topaz and Muscat. While cumulative yield (CY) per tree and cumulative yield efficiency (CYE) were determined to be the highest in Cooper 39, these values were found to be the lowest in Topaz. CY per hectare over the first three crop year was found to be the highest in Cooper 39 and the yield reached to 142. 9 t. ha 1. The lowest CY per hectare (69. 6 ton ha- 1) was determined in Topa...|$|R

In this study we use a point process probability structure to assess mechanical stimulus-response characteristics of muscle <b>spindle</b> spike <b>trains.</b> We assume that the stimulus intensity is primarily a linear combination of the spontaneous firing rate, the muscle extension, and the stretch velocity. By using {{the ability of the}} point process framework to provide an objective goodness of fit analysis, we were able to distinguish two classes of spike clusters with different statistical structure. We found that spike clusters with higher SNR have a temporal structure that can be fitted by an inverse Gaussian distribution while lower SNR clusters follow a Poisson-like distribution. The point process algorithm is further able to provide the instantaneous intensity function associated with the stimulus-response model with the best goodness of fit. This important result is a first step towards a point process decoding algorithm to estimate the muscle length and possibly provide closed loop Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems with natural sensory feedback information...|$|R
40|$|Business-to-business Product Service System (PSS) {{solutions}} {{are characterized by}} intensive interaction among PSS providers, suppliers, and customers, {{as well as an}} integration of physical and immaterial solution modules. These factors increase the complexity and interdisciplinary of such offerings. Furthermore, the characteristics complicate sustainability assessment and monitoring of PSS, as environmental, social, and economic concerns have to be integrated into a PSS by minimizing negative impacts of the PSS on these three axes throughout the PSS lifecycle. The indicator-based framework "PSS Sustainability Assessment and Monitoring (PSS-SAM) " has been specifically developed to support managers and decision makers in dealing with the complex situation described above. This framework considers the most important sustainability aspects throughout the entire PSS lifecycle and adheres to European standard requirements. The results of a previous work have already confirmed the usability of the framework to assess the sustainability of one PSS module (availability of spindle) within a single PSS lifecycle phase (operating phase). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the improvements of the PSS-SAM framework that facilitate sustainability assessment of PSS solutions with multiple modules throughout their entire lifecycle. The improved framework has been validated by a case study of an industrial micro-production PSS solution including multiple modules (<b>spindle,</b> maintenance, <b>training,</b> etc.). The long-term goal is to develop IT solutions that support the sustainability assessment of PSS...|$|R
40|$|The agronomic {{efficiency}} of dwarf interstock use is presently under debate in China where almost 90 % of apple orchards use vigorous rootstock, even in high density orchards. This study aimed at comparing two apple cultivars ('Fuji' and 'Gala') performance when grafted on a vigorous rootstock but associated either with a dwarf interstock (DT) {{or with a}} vigorous interstock (VF). Both orchards were trained with the <b>spindle</b> <b>training</b> system, in the conditions of Loess Plateau of China. For each cultivar and rootstock-interstock combination, 2 or 3 trees were digitized on which we estimated light interception and distribution at the tree scale. All trees were digitized at the current-year shoot scale, before harvest in 2011 and 2012. Shoots were distinguished according to length (long and short) and type (fruiting or vegetative). Virtual canopies were reconstructed based on allometric relationships and leaf angle distributions sampled at shoot and leaf scale in each year. Total leaf area (TLA), direct and diffuse projected leaf area (PLA) and silhouette to total leaf area (STAR) were estimated at the tree scale with the VegeSTAR software. TLA was affected by both cultivars and combinations, but PLA was only affected by combinations, for both diffuse and direct PLA. Moreover, STAR was affected by combinations, cultivars and years. The DT-trees compared to VF-trees and 'Gala' compared to 'Fuji' trees had higher STAR at tree scale and had higher number of voxels with higher STAR. In order to improve our understanding of rootstock - scion combination, we will use the RATP model to further study inter- and intra- tree microclimate and leaf functions (photosynthesis and transpiration) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} six weeks of strength training on static and dynamic balance in young male athletes. Thirty 15 - 17 young male athletes with mean and SD (62. 79 ± 3. 62 kg ∞ 171. 1 ± 4. 46 cm) were divided into two groups (15 subjects for each group). We used the SEBT and Romberg adjusted balance test before and after exercise programs to test balance. Strength exercise consisted, including: squat, leg extension, and calf raise, lunge, curl up. The results showed a significant increase in static and dynamic balance in the group (P= 0. 001). A possible reason for increased balance in the experimental group maybe increasing strength muscle in lower extremity after exercise program, the process of decreasing disinhibition and stimulating of muscles’ <b>spindles</b> during strength <b>training...</b>|$|R
50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the <b>spindle</b> and gear <b>train</b> along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R
40|$|Muscle spindle {{proprioceptive}} receptors play {{a primary}} role in encoding {{the effects of}} external mechanical perturbations to the body. During externally-imposed stretches of passive, i. e. electrically-quiescent, muscles, the instantaneous firing rates (IFRs) of muscle spindles are associated with characteristics of stretch such as length and velocity. However, even in passive muscle, there are history-dependent transients of muscle spindle firing that are not uniquely related to muscle length and velocity, nor reproduced by current muscle spindle models. These include acceleration-dependent initial bursts, increased dynamic response to stretch velocity if a muscle has been isometric, and rate relaxation, i. e., a decrease in tonic IFR when a muscle is held at a constant length after being stretched. We collected muscle <b>spindle</b> spike <b>trains</b> {{across a variety of}} muscle stretch kinematic conditions, including systematic changes in peak length, velocity, and acceleration. We demonstrate that muscle spindle primary afferents in passive muscle fire in direct relationship to muscle force-related variables, rather than length-related variables. Linear combinations of whole muscle-tendon force and the first time derivative of force (dF/dt) predict the entire time course of transient IFRs in muscle spindle Ia afferents during stretch (i. e., lengthening) of passive muscle, including the initial burst, the dynamic response to lengthening, and rate relaxation following lengthening. Similar to acceleration scaling found previously in postural responses to perturbations, initial burst amplitude scaled equally well to initial stretch acceleration or dF/dt, though later transients were only described by dF/dt. The transient increase in dF/dt at the onset of lengthening reflects muscle short-range stiffness due to cross-bridge dynamics. Our work demonstrates a critical role of muscle cross-bridge dynamics in history-dependent muscle spindle IFRs in passive muscle lengthening conditions relevant to the detection and sensorimotor response to mechanical perturbations to the body, and to previously-described history-dependence in perception of limb position...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the distinct contribution of slow (11 - 13 Hz) and fast (13 - 15 Hz) spindles in the consolidation process of a motor sequence learning task (MSL). Young subjects (n = 12) were trained on both a finger MSL task and a control (CTRL) condition, which were administered one week apart in a counterbalanced order. Subjects were asked to practice the MSL or CTRL task in the evening (approximately 9 : 00 p. m.) and their performance was retested on the same task 12 h later (approximately 9 : 00 a. m.). Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings were performed during the night following training on either task, and an automatic algorithm was used to detect fast and slow spindles and to quantify their characteristics (i. e., density, amplitude, and duration). Statistical analyses revealed higher fast (but not slow) <b>spindle</b> density after <b>training</b> on the MSL than after practice of the CTRL task. The increase in fast spindle density on the MSL task correlated positively with overnight performance gains on the MSL task and with difference in performance gain between the MSL and CTRL tasks. Together, {{these results suggest that}} fast sleep spindles help activate the cerebral network involved in overnight MSL consolidation, while slow spindles do not appear {{to play a role in}} this mnemonic process.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2001 – 2012 next to Wrocław (southwestern Poland). The purpose of this research was to assess the influence of type of nursery trees of pear cvs ‘Carola’ and ‘Dicolor’ budded on quince S 1 rootstock on growth and cropping, as well as fruit quality of two pear cultivars. The trees were planted in the spring of 2001 in 4 replications with 5 trees per plot. Trees were planted in rows with spacing 1. 2 × 3. 5 m (2381 trees per hectare). Three types of nursery trees, all without feathers, were planted: two-year-old (3 years in a nursery), one-year-old maidens (2 years in a nursery) and annual grafts (only 1 year in a nursery). Tree canopies were formed as a <b>spindle</b> and were <b>trained</b> in the Güttingen-V system. Until the twelfth year after planting, growth and yield were significantly affected by the type of nursery trees. One-year-old maidens were characterized by the strongest vigor in orchard, while pears planted as two-year-old trees grew rather weak (especially with ‘Dicolor’ cv.). Planting two-year-old trees didn’t have any clear positive influence on tree cropping in the orchard. The final results of the study proved that trees planted as annual grafts, irrespective of cultivar, yielded significantly worse. The type of nursery trees had no clear influence on mean fruit weight...|$|R
40|$|Many {{recent studies}} on the {{segmental}} motor control system have employed spike-triggered-averaging (STA) {{and other forms of}} cross-correlation to either attribute CNS, reflex, or direct motor effects to the impulses of a single (reference) neuronal spike train or to explore conditions under which pairs of neural units show temporal correlations in their discharge. Our experience with these techniques suggested the need for a control procedure that tests for synchrony between the reference and other spike trains such as to: (1) either preclude that the observed effects are due to spike trains other than or in addition to the reference train; or (2) give insight into the conditions leading to correlated discharge between two units. A motor unit synchronization test based on analysis of EMG waveforms has already been described. We have modified this test for the detection of synchrony between either afferent or efferent signals by analysis of averaged muscle nerve signals rather than EMG waveforms. Our procedure involves use of a multi-unit muscle nerve recording that serves as the input to a signal averager triggered by a spike train from either: (1) a motor unit's EMG; (2) a dorsal root filament or ganglion cell; or (3) a ramdom trigger source. With appropriate delay of the muscle nerve signal input, the non-rectified average of the trigger signal's waveform is compared to the rectified average which contains this waveform together with contributions of all other active unitary events. Additionally, the rectified average is compared to a "randomly" triggered average of the same input signal. On the basis of these recordings, it can be determined, within certain boundary conditions, whether or not any other unitary events are in synchrony with the reference event. Such synchronization is expressed quantitatively {{in the form of a}} synchronization index (SI). We evaluated the efficacy of the SI by electronic simulation procedures and by comparing its use to that of a cross-correlation procedure that tests for synchrony on the basis of crosscorrelograms computed between two simultaneously recorded <b>spindle</b> afferent spike <b>trains</b> during brief stretch of a passive muscle at progressively increasing amplitudes (5 - 100 um). These experiments revealed that the SI is a sensitive test of afferent synchrony in the passive muscle provided the spike trains of interest have a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 0. 2 in the muscle nerve recording and that it is recognized that the detectable degree of synchronization of a non-reference event is a function of its S/N ratio. For tests on the active muscle, the force levels must remain low. Otherwise increased neuronal activity in the muscle nerve recording decreases the S/N ratio of individual spike trains. Thus, despite restrictive (but predictable) boundary conditions, the SI test can contribute importantly to select conclusions drawn from cross-correlation studies...|$|R
