40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the synergistic effects of corrosion and wear of artificial human joints made from a <b>surgical</b> grade <b>cast</b> F- 75 cobalt–chromium–molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloy. Both electrochemical and gravimetric measurements {{have been used to}} determine the performance of CoCrMo samples in static environments and under predominantly three-body abrasive wear conditions using the micro-abrasion test method. Electrochemical measurements are presented from embedded corrosion cells within a micro-abrasion rig. Micro-abrasion–corrosion has been studied using an aggressive abrasive slurry (SiC/Ringer's) to identify depassivation and repassivation processes. These initial conditions are an attempt to simulate worst-case scenarios where wear, cement or bone debris are entrained into the contact. The in situ wear-corrosion measurements have been used to identify the implications of wear and corrosion on both the implant and tentative implications for the patient over the long term. Results show strong synergistic effects occur ranging from negative to positive (i. e. beneficial to accelerated surface removal rates).

50|$|Bone heals by {{formation}} of a callus over the defective area. Speed and quality of healing {{is directly related to}} the blood supply and fracture stability. Rest is required immediately following injury to reduce movement of the fracture site. Stability may be improved through use of <b>surgical</b> implants or <b>casting,</b> depending on the location of extent of the fracture. Shock wave therapy is sometimes employed in the case of splint bone fracture or stress fractures to the cannon bones, to improve blood flow to the area. Fractures within a joint, such as chip fractures in the knee, hock, or fetlock, require arthroscopic surgery to prevent secondary arthritis of that joint.|$|R

30|$|Twenty-five years later, Mehta {{published}} her {{prospective study}} on the cast treatment of infantile progressive scoliosis on 136 patients [14]. The cast application was performed following the method of Cotrel and Morel; however, Mehta did not use straps for de-rotation but instead the cast was molded with manual pressure over the rib prominence. The spinal deformity was completely corrected if the treatment with casting started early in children with moderate curves. Cast treatment did not resolve the curves in older children with severe curves; however, the curve magnitude was effectively reduced. Following this impressive prospective report, serial casting quickly became an accepted method {{for the management of}} EOS as both a definitive treatment and to delay <b>surgical</b> procedures.

30|$|Reported {{frequency}} {{estimates of}} AVN following closed reduction vary significantly between 4 and 60 % [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. There {{is therefore a}} significant discrepancy in the literature, with difficulty in interpreting the expected rate of AVN. Whilst this variation may be a consequence of natural variation due to the relatively small case numbers, it may similarly be due to systemic differences such as case selection, or <b>surgical</b> technique (i.e. <b>cast</b> position, duration of treatment, tendon release). A {{clear understanding of the}} expected AVN rate would empower surgeons to audit their own practice against a ‘standard’, would provide feasibility data for the measure of effect size in future intervention studies, and may help to elicit if there are particular aspects of the surgical intervention that may particularly heighten the risk of AVN.|$|R
40|$|GOAL OF THE STUDY: To analyse {{the results}} of non <b>surgical</b> {{treatment}} (<b>cast</b> for 12 weeks) for complete and recent rupture of Achilles tendon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed with an average follow up of 2 years 14 patients (14 ruptures). All patients evaluated subjective results on a linear scale. Objective results were given by clinical examination, ultrasonography and performance testing. RESULTS: Subjective results were excellent for 50 % of cases, good for 29 % and fair for 21 %. Amyotrophy of the calf was always noted (mean 15 cm). The maximum force was reduced by 22 % and the endurance by 47 % {{in comparison with the}} healthy calf. All sportsmen but one were able to continue their sport as before. None of them had to change their job. DISCUSSION: The conservative treatment of fresh ruptured Achilles tendon by plaster cast for 12 weeks gives satisfactory results in comparison with surgical treatment followed by 6 weeks immobilisation. The results are not so good when compared to conservative or surgical treatment followed by immediate mobilisation. CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment by plaster cast for 12 weeks should be applied to non compliant patients or to patients who are not concerned by the functional results or unable to follow a programme of reeducation or to patients with chronic skin lesions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Congenital talipes equino varus (CTEV) is a three {{dimensional}} deformity {{and is one}} of {{the most}} common congenital abnormalities affecting the lower limb and can be challenging to manage. Hind-foot deformity is considered the most difficult to treat. Unfortunately, the calcaneus is often small and thus difficult to control during <b>casting</b> after <b>surgical</b> release in severe or relapsed cases. We used three pins to control and maintain the hind foot correction, after <b>surgical</b> release, during <b>casting</b> in 47 cases (59 feet). We introduced a modified, coronal plane, transverse calcaneal pin. This pin is inserted from medial to lateral through the calcaneus to correct the varus mal-positioning of the calcaneus in the sagittal plane and to provide a better control on the small sized, hind-foot during casting. We paid special attention to the final hind-foot deformity after surgery, and the results were favorable after the application of this transverse pin. </p...|$|R
50|$|People with AMC look {{their worst}} at birth. AMC is {{considered}} non-progressive, so with proper medical treatment, things can improve. The joint contractures that are present {{will not get}} worse than {{they are at the}} time of birth. There is no way to completely resolve or cure AMC. But with proper treatment, most children make significant improvements in their range of motion and ability to move their limbs which enables them to do activities of daily life, and live relatively normal lives. Therapeutic interventions that are cornerstone in the treatment of AMC include: stretching and range of motion exercises, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, splinting and serial <b>casting.</b> <b>Surgical</b> intervention may also improve joint mobility and function. Other positive prognostic factors for independent walking were active hips and knees, hip flexion contractures of less than 20 degrees and knee flexion contractures less than 15 degrees without severe scoliosis.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{guidelines}} exist {{regarding the}} prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in orthopedic surgery. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare (inter) national guidelines and analyse differences. Methods: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the internet were searched for guidelines on {{the prevention of}} VTE in orthopedic surgery. From these, we constructed a table comparing the different antithrombotic regimens during different orthopedic <b>surgical</b> and plaster <b>cast</b> treatments. RESULTS: Eleven guidelines from nine different countries and one international guideline were included. Few guidelines advise on thrombosis prophylaxis after plaster cast immobilization, (prolonged) arthroscopic surgery and isolated lower extremity trauma. Different opinions exist on the sole use of aspirin and mechanical prophylaxis and {{on the use of}} vitamin K antagonists after major hip and knee surgery. CONCLUSION: Based on the same available literature, different guidelines recommend different thromboprophylactic regimens. Ideally, the grade of recommendation should be based on the same level of evidence world-wide. Whilst there is no agreement on the relevance of different endpoints (e. g. asymptomatic DVT), {{it is very difficult to}} reach a consensus.

This paper proposes {{a new approach to}} overcome the problem by introducing weakly structured light actively <b>casting</b> <b>surgical</b> tool shadows on organ surfaces. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we propose a robust approach to extract shadow edges from a sequence of shadowed images; second, we develop a novel field surface interpolation (FSI) approach to obtain an accurate and dense disparity map. Our approach does not rely on texture information and is able to reconstruct accurate 3 -D information by exploiting shadows from surgical tools. One advantage is that the point correspondences are directly calculated and no explicit stereo matching is required, which ensures the efficiency of the method. Another advantage is the minimum hardware requirement because only stereo cameras and a separated single-point light source are required. We evaluated the proposed approach using both phantom models and ex vivo images. Based on the experimental results, we achieved the precision of the recovered 3 -D surfaces within 0. 7 mm for phantom models and 1. 2 mm for ex vivo images.

40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to compare the outcome {{following}} conservative or surgical treatment for displaced fracture of the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity. MATERIALS AND METHODS 14 men and 4 women aged 20 to 44 years chose to undergo conservative (9 feet) or surgical (10 feet) treatment by a single surgeon for closed displaced fracture of the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity. The injury mechanism was a fall from a height of < 1. 5 m; the mean time from injury to treatment was 3 (range 1 - 7) days. Conservative treatment comprised immobilisation in a plaster <b>cast.</b> <b>Surgical</b> treatment involved fixation with a half thread cannulated screw for large fragments (in 6 feet) or a mini-plate for comminuted fragments (in 4 feet). At the final follow-up, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot score was evaluated. RESULTS The conservative and surgery groups were comparable in terms of age, gender and fracture displacement. The mean follow-up duration was 20 (range, 14 - 24) months. All patients had bone union; none had implant loosening or breakage. One patient with surgical treatment developed skin numbness at the medial aspect of the heel that resolved following neurotrophic drug treatment for 3 months. The surgery group achieved earlier full weight bearing (5. 8 vs. 7. 5 weeks, p< 0. 001) and return to work (5. 9 vs. 8. 2 weeks, p= 0. 048), but comparable AOFAS score (89. 0 vs. 88. 2, p= 0. 4).
