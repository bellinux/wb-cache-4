40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{texture of}} {{processed}} berry fruits changes both during processing and subsequent storage. A study {{was made of}} these changes in processed strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blue- berries, spin-cooked and stored at 100 °F. for 28 days in tin and glass containers. Four samples, {{from each of the}} two replications of the above, four berries,were analyzed immediately after processing and after 3, 7, 14, and 28 days of storage at 100 °F. Physical measurement of texture was obtained by the use of Maryland <b>Shear-press.</b> The work diagrams thus obtained were studied in detail. These samples, after being subjected to the <b>Shear-press,</b> were analyzed for percent A. I. S. and total pectin. The results indicated the following: 1. There {{was no significant difference in}} the texture, percent A. I. S. and total pectin, between berries processed and stored in tin and glass containers over a period of 28 days at 100 °F, 2. Highest correlation was obtained between texture as measured by partial work and total pectin in case of strawberries and blueberries and between maximum force and percent A. I. S. in raspberries and blackberries. 3. Maryland <b>Shear-press</b> gave characteristic work diagrams for each of the four berries, which were consistent throughout. 4. A linear relationship was obtained between sample size and texture as measured by the total work...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 In {{the present}} study, the textural changes induced in Chinese waterchestnuts by {{physical}} and chemical means were of prime concern. After being subjected to chemical and heat treatments, the corms were analyzed to relate the chemical changes with the physical changes in the corms. Chinese waterchestnuts were peeled, filled in cans with one hundred ml of various concentrations of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, and heated in the retort for one hour at 240 °F (115. 6 °C). Distilled water {{was used for the}} control samples. Physical and chemical examinations followed, and the results of the texture measurements were compared with the chemical composition of the corms. A physical measurement of texture was obtained by using the Maryland <b>Shear-press.</b> The drained weights, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, ash, total sugars, cellulose, starch, total pectins including three pectic fractions, phosphorus, calcium and potassium were determined. Measurements of pH, degrees Brix, and color intensity were made on the processed liquid. The results indicated the following conclusions: 1. Processing in both acid and alkali had a definite softening effect on the Chinese waterchestnut corm. 2. The highest correlation was obtained between texture (as measured by maximum force and total work) and cellulose in both the acid and alkali series. 3. The hydrolysis of cellulose and starch was more complete in the acid series. 4. A linear relationship existed between the pH of the acid series and texture. 5. The samples processed in acid showed more consistent trends than did the alkali processed samples. 6. There was a darkening in color as the concentration of both the acid and alkali increased. 7. The percentages of total solids and AIS showed a definite trend when compared with the texture measurements. 8. The relationship between firmness of the corms and the pectic substances in this study was a complex relationship due to the reactive nature of the pectic compounds...|$|E
