40|$|Failure {{investigation}} {{was done on}} a 321 stainless steel charge heater tube which failed in a refinery unit processing heavy crude oil. Crude oil was the charge in the radiant and convection sections; while saturated <b>stripping</b> <b>steam</b> is present in convection section. After a leak was detected, visual inspection revealed that nine convection tubes had black oil/coke deposits on their external surfaces. The deposits were seen on the first three rows of tubes. When one of the tubes was lightly ground at the black colored area, a circumferential crack was visually observed. The investigation revealed that long-term aging, coupled with localized deposition of salts and coke from the heavy crude led to sensitization of the tube surface layers. This in turn resulted in sulphidation of the internal surface grain boundaries, formation of grooves, and cracking of the material. Thus, cracking was intergranular in nature in the initial stage, but became transgranular at later stages.

The major energy requirements are the reboiler duty for solvent regeneration and the compression work for CO 2 sequestration.

By considering the cost of the main heat exchangers, the temperature approaches and pressure drops of the cross exchanger and the steam heater were optimized.

The CDU system consists of three industrial units processing a blending of five extra-heavy crude oils and producing two commercial fuels, Jet- 1 A and Diesel. The NLP model involves typical restrictions (e. g., flow rate according to capacity of pumps, distillation columns, etc.) and the heat integration of streams from atmospheric distillation towers (ADTs) and vacuum distillation towers (VDTs) with the heat exchanger networks for crude oil preheating. A metamodeling approach is used so as to represent the ADTs. Preheating networks are modeled with mass, energy balances, and design equations of each heat exchanger.

The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether significant improvements in liquid-solid contact could be achieved by optimizing {{the location of the}} spray nozzles. In the coker regions where bitumen is injected, the gas is a mixture of product vapors and steam. Steam introduced at different levels rises through the coker: the <b>stripping</b> <b>steam</b> is injected near the bottom, then the attrition steam above the stripper and finally the bitumen atomization steam. As a result, the cross-sectional averaged gas velocity greatly varies vertically, from the lowest spray bank to the highest spray bank. In addition, there are large radial variations in gas velocity, as gas bubbles tend to concentrate in the central region of the bed. In this study, the impacts on liquid-solid contact of gas velocity and uneven gas distribution were investigated. The effects of spray pulsations and atomization gas flowrate on liquid distribution were also studied. Effects of bed hydrodynamics on the initial liquid distribution and on the subsequent drying were studied separately. The results indicate that jet pulsations or increasing the atomization gas flowrate improve the liquid distribution.

This solvent has the advantages of forming two liquid phases upon CO 2 loading, one rich in CO 2 and the other very low in CO 2. Having a highly concentrated rich solvent improvements could be reached by reducing the sensible heat and improving the equilibrium sensitivity hence reducing the need for <b>stripping</b> <b>steam.</b> Also {{it is possible that}} the heat of absorption may change to the better. To better understand this system in designing the separation unit requires substantial work on characterization of the solvent. One important aspect is to provide equilibrium data. In this work new ebulliometric VLE data for the binary DEEA/H 2 O and DEEA/MAPA systems and the ternary DEEA/MAPA/H 2 O system are reported at different temperatures and concentrations. Results show that pure MAPA is more volatile than DEEA, but in aqueous solution MAPA was found to be less volatile. A mix of DEEA and MAPA in aqueous solution tends to lower the volatility thus makes the system more advantageous by reducing volatility. The activity coefficients for the species in the ternary aqueous system are found to be lower than the activity coefficients obtained from the corresponding binary aqueous mixtures. The UNIQUAC framework was implemented to represent the experimental data. The six UNIQUAC parameters were determined and were able to predict P-T-x-y, activity coefficient, excess enthalpy and freezing point depression for both the binary and ternary systems. However, a small inconsistency was observed between water activity coefficients determined from ebulliometer and freezing point depression measurements. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{challenge}} for the CO 2 post combustion capture from power plant flue gases is {{the reduction of the}} energy requirement for solvent regeneration. The required reduction can only be achieved by application of new solvents. For the validation of new solvents in the absorption/desorption process, a pilot plant (column diameters 0. 125  m, absorber packing height 4. 2  m, flue gas flow 30 – 110  kg/h, CO 2 partial pressure 35 – 135  mbar) was built in the EUproject CASTOR. To obtain a baseline for testing of new solvents, first systematic studies were carried out with MEA in that plant. All important process parameters, i. e. CO 2 content in the flue gas, CO 2 removal rate ΨCO 2, fluid dynamic load, and solvent flow rate were varied. These studies allow detailed insight into the process, e. g., a quantification of the different contributions to the overall regeneration energy (namely: desorption enthalpy, <b>stripping</b> <b>steam,</b> heating up of solvent feed and condensate recycle) {{as a function of the}} chosen process parameters. A rate-based model of the process based on a detailed physico-chemical model was implemented in the process simulator CHEMASIM. It is shown that the model is able to predict the experimental results for MEA. Besides MEA, two new solvents were studied in the pilot plant. A direct comparison of different solvents in such pilot plant experiments is not trivial. The comparison of only a few operating points for the new solvents with seemingly corresponding results for MEA can lead to wrong conclusions, since for each solvent an optimisation of the operating conditions is necessary. Only systematical studies allow a meaningful comparison. The technique that was used in the present work for this purpose was measuring data sets at constant CO 2 removal rate (by adjustment of the regeneration energy in the desorber) and systematically varying the solvent flow rate. A minimal energy requirement for the given removal rate is found from theses studies. Only the optima for different solvents should be compared. By this procedure, one solvent candidate was identified that shows an advantage compared to MEA...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to investigate}} the possibility of substituting <b>stripping</b> <b>steam</b> with an alternative gas, which will be recycled in a closed loop at the process, without changing physical state. This modification of the atmospheric distillation process increases the revenues of the unit, compared with the conventional. The increases are justified as a 2 - 4 % wt. increase of the unit’s yield in distillates. The utilization of an alternative stripping medium has also some side advantages, as the sparing of the enthalpy of vaporization and condensation of the medium in the unit, {{the reduction of the}} demineralized water consumption and the elimination of the water dew point corrosion of the atmospheric column’s top. The proposed modification is more environmentally friendly, because it does not produce water / hydrocarbon emulsions. The alternative stripping medium that was used {{for the purposes of the}} dissertation is the refinery’s fuel gas, which is made mainly of H 2, C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4. Ethane is found in the crude oil and it is produced mainly by the atmospheric distillation itself. Other sources are the naphtha reformer and the hydrocracker units. Hydrogen is a product of the naphtha reformer. Most of it is used at the refinery’s hydrotreaters and the surplus is mixed with the fuel gas. Ethylene is not a constituent of the crude oil. It is produced by cracking processes, mainly by the Fluid Catalytic Cracker Unit, (FCC). In order to simplify the calculations, the make - up stripping medium is considered to be pure C 2 H 6. The other reasons for its selection are: • It is incondensable at the operating conditions of the atmospheric distillation. • It is abundant at any refinery. • It is not corrosive, because it is treated at amine absorber units, in order to remove the H 2 S. • A big amount is produced by the atmospheric distillation itself. • It does not condense and dissolve corrosive agents, as Η 2 Ο steam does. The conclusion of the dissertation is that “dry” stripping is feasible not only for new units, but it can also be applied to the existing ones as a revamp. The same principle can be utilized also at different processes. In fact, the conclusions of the study were utilized at the design of a new stripper column, for a lubricating oil hydrotreating unit. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{more than}} 80 % of the world’s energy {{consumption}} {{coming from the}} burning of fossil fuel (BP, 2013; IEA, 2013), the mitigation of greenhouse-gas from the energy sector is crucial for avoiding climate change. Amine scrubbing is the most mature and well-understood process for post-combustion CO 2 capture (Rochelle, 2009; Svendsen et al., 2011). In amine scrubbing, the regeneration of the solvent accounts for the most energy demanding {{part of the process}} (Aroonwilas & Veawab, 2007; Van Wagener & Rochelle, 2011). In a coal-fired power plant, the energy requirement for the stripper reboiler is calculated to be 15 - 30 % of the net power production (Jassim & Rochelle, 2006). The energy demand of the process is directly correlated to the chosen solvent. Therefore, the development of new solvents or solvent blends has gained much attention during the past 15 years. The aqueous mixture of 5 M DEEA/ 2 M MAPA is a promising solvent for CO 2 post combustion capture. This solvent has a particular characteristic as it forms two liquid phases upon CO 2 loading. In this case the formation of two phases is desired as having one lean and one very CO 2 -rich phase (upper and lower phase, respectively) gives a potential for lowering the liquid circulation rate, thereby lowering the sensible heat needed for increasing the CO 2 pressure in the desorber and thereby lower the <b>stripping</b> <b>steam</b> requirement, and finally, by using a mixture of a tertiary and primary/secondary amine the operative heat of absorption can be lowered thus lowering the heat needed for reversion of the absorption reaction. Moreover, the primary/secondary amine will enhance the capture rate while the tertiary amine will raise the capture capacity of the solvent. In addition, because of the very rich solution sent to regeneration, one may produce the CO 2 at elevated pressures. In this thesis several experiments has been carried out in the DEEA/MAPA system in order to characterize this solvent. The screening experiments showed the potential of this solvent for CO 2 capture. VLE experiments were carried out in the single amine systems both with and without CO 2. In addition, density and viscosity measurements were performed. These experiments are described in Chapter 2 of this thesis. The VLE data were used to develop thermodynamic models. The eNRTL model was chosen to model the liquid phase while the Peng-Robinson EoS was used in the vapour phase modelling. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to fit the eNRTL parameters. For the simulations of the pilot plant, a simplified soft model was used since very few data is available for the DEEA/MAPA system. The data from the screening experiments were used to fit the parameters of the soft model. An attempt to describe the oxidative degradation of MEA by a rigorous model is shown. The model is able to represent the development in time of the concentrations of most of the compounds. However, this model is only an initial step of the solvent degradation modelling and substantial work, both on the experimental and modelling side, is remaining in order to satisfactorily define a model for the oxidative degradation. The DEEA/MAPA system was tested in the Gløshaugen (NTNU/SINTEF) pilot plant. The solvent was shown to be relatively easy to operate within the pilot plant. Neither high viscosity nor foaming issues were noted. Absorption was reasonably fast and the CO 2 stripping in this system was easily done due to the presence of a tertiary amine. Moreover, the system was able to operate at significantly lower specific reboiler duty and reboiler temperatures compared to the benchmark 30 wt. % MEA. The solvent was, however, more volatile than MEA and better control to avoid solvent losses is required in a real plant. The experimental pilot campaign for the DEEA/MAPA system was validated towards simulation models implemented in CO 2 SIM. A total of 18 runs from the campaign were validated and simulated with CO 2 SIM. The model of the DEEA/MAPA system was successfully implemented in CO 2 SIM and can be used for further simulations of large scale plants.

The Selexol process can operate selectively to recover hydrogen sulfide {{and carbon dioxide}} as separate streams, so that the hydrogen sulfide {{can be sent to}} either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulfur or to a WSA Process unit for conversion to sulfuric acid while, at the same time, the carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), was to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} vapor-phase bioreactor system for the destruction of trichloroethylene (TCE) from contaminated groundwater. A field demonstration was per-formed using groundwater at the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site contaminated with a complex mixture of organic chemicals. This site is managed and operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. for the Department of Energy (DOE). Analysis of the data generated during the test can be summarized in three major observations. First, TCE was degraded in the presence of all the organics found in the <b>steam</b> <b>strip</b> condensate. This was observed during treatment of both the <b>steam</b> <b>strip</b> condensate and condensate amended with TCE to increase its concentration relative to the other components. The conclusion that TCE was being biodegraded was supported by performing mass balance control experiments with the reactor and by tracking recalcitrant chemicals also present in the steam stripper condensate. Second, there appeared to be an initial lag period of up to 24 hours before onset of TCE degradation in the reactor. The source of this lag was not determined but could be related to either an acclimation of the microorganisms to other chemicals found in the condensate or reversible inhibitory effects on TCE degradation. The duration of TCE degradative activity was relatively short for only 2 to 5 days. compared to previous demonstrations where TCE was the sole contaminant. However, several of the runs were interrupted due to mechanical and not biological issues. Third, other chemical contaminants were also degraded. by the bacteria used in the vapor phase reactor which is consistent with previous work performed both at ENVIROGEN and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Three {{classes of}} amine-functionalized mesocellular foam (MCF) {{materials}} are prepared and evaluated as CO 2 adsorbents. The {{stability of the}} adsorbents under steam/air and steam/nitrogen conditions is investigated using a Parr autoclave reactor to simulate, in an accelerated manner, the exposure that such adsorbents will see under <b>steam</b> <b>stripping</b> regeneration conditions at various temperatures. The CO 2 capacity and organic content of all adsorbents decrease after steam treatment under both steam/air and steam/nitrogen conditions, primarily due to structural collapse of the MCF framework, but with additional contributions likely associated with amine degradation during treatment under harsh conditions. Treatment with steam/air is found to have stronger effect on the CO 2 capacity of the adsorbents compared to steam/nitrogen. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
50|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>strips</b> the {{dissolved}} {{gas from the}} boiler feedwater and exits via the vent valve {{at the top of}} the domed section. Should this vent valve not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the vent valve not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. The vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam.|$|R
50|$|The iron-hulled barque {{was built}} in Liverpool, England in 1869 by Bowdler Chaffer & Company for S. Meyers & Company. Originally christened Cape Clear with Lloyds of London in 1870, she started {{her career as a}} screw {{steamboat}} with auxiliary sail carrying passengers on the Australia - Liverpool run. She was purchased by a French firm based in Bordeaux in 1889, re-christened Georges Valentine and turned into a sailing bark by being <b>stripped</b> of all <b>steam</b> machinery except the boiler. Rigged as a three-masted barkentine, she was then sold to a firm based in Dunkirk, northern France. In 1895, she was sold to Mortolo & Simonetti, based in Genoa, Italy. She was based in Camogli, northern Italy and transported lumber regularly from Pensacola, Florida to South America.|$|R
