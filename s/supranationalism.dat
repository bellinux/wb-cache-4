Then-French President Charles de Gaulle's opposition to <b>supranationalism</b> and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an [...] "empty chair policy" [...] whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, the {{decision}} was made through Treaty of Rome 1957 to launch the first European Economic Community. It shared the Assembly and Court with the Coal and Steel Community, but set up parallel bodies for the Council and Commission. Based on the Spaak Report of 1956, it sought to break down all barriers to trade in a common market for goods, services, labour and capital, and prevent distortion of competition and regulate areas of common interest like agriculture, energy and transport. A separate treaty was signed for a European Atomic Energy Community to manage nuclear production. In 1961 the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway applied for membership only to be vetoed in 1963 by France's Charles de Gaulle. Spain also applied and was rejected as it was still led by the Franco dictatorship. The same year, the Court of Justice proclaimed that the Community constituted a [...] "new legal order of international law". The Merger Treaty 1965 finally placed the ECSC and Euratom within the EEC. Shortly after, de Gaulle boycotted the Commission, which he believed was pressing <b>supranationalism</b> too far. The Luxembourg compromise in 1966 agreed that France (or other countries) could veto issues of [...] "very important national interest", particularly relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, instead of making decisions by [...] "qualified majority". But after the May 1968 events in France and de Gaulle's resignation, the way was free for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to join in 1973. Norway had rejected joining in a 1972 referendum, while the UK confirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum. Aside from the European Economic Community itself, the European continent underwent a profound transition towards democracy. The dictators of Greece and Portugal were deposed in 1974, and Spain's dictator died in 1975, enabling their accession in 1981 and 1986. In 1979, the European Parliament had its first direct elections, reflecting a growing consensus that the EEC should be less a union of member states, and more a union of peoples. The Single European Act 1986 increased the number of treaty issues in which qualified majority voting (rather than consensus) would be used to legislate, as a way to accelerate trade integration. The Schengen Agreement of 1985 (not initially signed by Italy, the UK, Ireland, Denmark or Greece) allowed movement of people without any border checks. Meanwhile, in 1987, the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev announced policies of [...] "transparency" [...] and [...] "restructuring" [...] (glasnost and perestroika). This revealed the depths of corruption and waste. In April 1989, the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June elections. These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism. In November 1989, protestors in Berlin began taking down the Berlin Wall, which became a symbol of the collapse of the Iron Curtain, with most of Eastern Europe declaring independence and moving to hold democratic elections by 1991.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph H. H. Weiler, in his seminal work The Dual Character of <b>Supranationalism,</b> {{states that}} there are two main facets to European <b>supranationalism,</b> {{although}} these seem to be true of many supranational systems. These are: ...|$|E
50|$|Most of the inter-parliamentary {{institutions}} do {{not hold}} legislative power and have a consulting or informal cooperation-stimulating role. When the intergovernmental organization chooses to operate through a hybrid system of not only intergovernmentalism, but also <b>supranationalism</b> an organization-level legislature is established (or a predecessor inter-parliamentary institution is granted legislative power) {{in the form of}} international parliament. Members of international parliaments could be assigned {{in the same way as}} members of inter-parliamentary institutions or in cases of more advanced <b>supranationalism</b> they could be directly elected.|$|E

50|$|An {{international}} parliament is {{a branch}} of an intergovernmental organization tasked with legislative powers and thus establishing a hybrid system of not only intergovernmentalism, but also <b>supranationalism.</b> It could {{be based on a}} predecessor inter-parliamentary institution or a newly established organization-level legislature.|$|E
50|$|The Founding Fathers of the European Community and {{the present}} European Union said that <b>supranationalism</b> was the {{cornerstone}} of the governmental system.

50|$|Intergovernmentalism is an {{alternative}} theory of political integration, where power in international organizations is possessed by the member-states and decisions are made unanimously. Independent appointees of the governments or elected representatives have solely advisory or implementational functions. Intergovernmentalism is used by most international organizations today. An alternative method of decision-making in international organizations is <b>supranationalism.</b>|$|E

50|$|Such {{branches}} of intergovernmental organizations are typically established {{in order to}} provide for representation of citizens, rather than governments who are represented in other bodies within the organization. The assembly can be composed of members of the national legislatures (whose members are directly elected in most cases) or of its own directly elected members, further strengthening the <b>supranationalism</b> of the organization.|$|E
50|$|Today <b>supranationalism</b> only {{exists in}} the two European Communities inside the EU: the Economic Community (often called the European Community {{although}} it does not legally cover all State activities) and Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community, a non-proliferation community, in which certain potentialities have been frozen or blocked). Supranational Communities provide powerful but generally unexploited and innovatory means for democratic foreign policy, by mobilising civil society to the democratically agreed goals of the Community.|$|E
50|$|In July 1965, intergovernmentalist Charles De Gaulle boycotted European {{institutions}} due {{to issues}} he had regarding new political proposals by the European Commission.

50|$|Only {{the first}} pillar {{followed}} {{the principles of}} <b>supranationalism.</b> The pillar structure of the EU allowed the areas of European co-operation to be increased without leaders handing {{a large amount of}} power to supranational institutions. The pillar system segregated the EU. What were formerly the competencies of the EEC fell within the European Community pillar. Justice and Home Affairs was introduced as a new pillar while European Political Cooperation became the second pillar (the Common Foreign and Security Policy).|$|E

However, with the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, new intergovernmental elements have been introduced alongside the more federal systems, making it more difficult to define the European Union (the EU). The European Union, which operates through a hybrid system of intergovernmentalism and <b>supranationalism,</b> is not officially a federation - though various academic observers regard it as having the characteristics of a federal system.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Supranationalism</b> was {{strongest in}} the first pillar.

Later, through the Treaty of Maastricht the word [...] "Economic" [...] {{was removed from the}} EEC, so it became simply the EC. Then with the Treaty of Amsterdam additional areas would be transferred from the third pillar to the first. In 2002, the ECSC (which had a lifetime of 50 years) ceased to exist because the treaty which established it, the Treaty of Paris, had expired.|$|E
50|$|Another {{criticism}} on {{the theory}} of multi-level governance is that it's not really a proper theory, rather {{that it is an}} approach. The main difference between multi-level governance and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between intergovernmentalism and <b>supranationalism</b> and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the sovereignty of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.|$|E

50|$|After {{the failure}} of the Fouchet Plan and De Gaulle's veto of the United Kingdom's {{application}} for EC membership, the Commission attempted to move towards integration by proposing an idea that would combine the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the European Parliament, and Commission. De Gaulle supported the creation of the CAP and favoured its enactment. However, he disagreed with the Parliament's new role, the Commission's strength, the shift towards <b>supranationalism,</b> and the budget proposals for financing the CAP. De Gaulle made it a condition that majority voting with a right to veto must exist if France was to participate in the European Community. When de Gaulle was not granted a more intergovernmental Commission or voting and veto rights, the French representative left the Council of Ministers.|$|E
50|$|In the Lisbon Treaty and {{the earlier}} nearly {{identical}} Constitutional Treaty, the democratic {{independence of the}} five key institutions is further blurred. This moves the project from full democratic <b>supranationalism</b> {{in the direction of}} not just intergovernmentalism but the politicisation of the institutions, and control by two or three major party political organisations. The Commission defines key legal aspects of the supranational system because its members must be independent of commercial, labour, consumer, political or lobby interests (Article 9 of the Paris Treaty). The Commission was to be composed of a small number of experienced personalities, whose impartiality was beyond question. As such, the early presidents of the Commission and the High Authority were strong defenders of European democracy against national, autocratic practice or the rule of the strong over the weak.|$|E
5000|$|Florian's stance, and {{especially}} {{his commitment to}} independent social democracy, made him a suspect upon the establishment of Romania's communist regime. As noted by researcher Victor Frunză, Florian and Alexandru Claudian made a [...] "high sacrifice" [...] when they refused {{to give in to}} [...] "blackmail" [...] and would not join the [...] "Workers' Party" [...] (as the Communist Party styled itself upon its absorption of Social Democratic sympathizers). In 1948, he was stripped of his university chair. Placed under constant surveillance by the Securitate, Romania's new secret police, he was soon after arrested. During his eight-month-long imprisonment without trial, he had the revelation on [...] "recessivity as world structure". The new system evidenced that Florian had come to criticize some of the basic assumptions in Western philosophy, and conceiving of the world through the teachings of genetics. His system divided existence alongside its two, equal but alternating, attributes: the dominant trait tempered by the recessive (albeit not degraded) one; violence to love, rational to irrational, nationalism to <b>supranationalism.</b>|$|E

40|$|Borders define {{jurisdiction}}s. To uphold borders is {{to claim}} jurisdiction; {{to claim the}} right to decide on the law. The nation state makes such a claim. It seeks jurisdiction over a particular territory. By implication, the nation state also acknowledges that other jurisdictions may apply beyond that territory. Borders work two-ways, and while they grant the nation state exclusive jurisdiction, they also limit the nation state’s claims to the designated territory. <b>Supranationalism</b> and multiculturalism undermine the idea of exclusive territorial jurisdiction. <b>Supranationalism</b> grants institutions the power to break through national borders and to overrule the nation state’s territorial arrangements. In this way, borders become increasingly porous. Multiculturalism, meanwhile, not only deligitimizes the nation state’s borders by weakening the collective identity of the people living behind them; it also encourages religious sub-groups to invoke rules from beyond the nation state’s borders, thereby undermining the very idea of territorial jurisdiction. ‘God’s heart has no borders’, to put it bluntly. <b>Supranationalism</b> and multiculturalism are thus antithetical to national sovereignty and to the borders therein implied. <b>Supranationalism</b> dilutes sovereignty, and so brings about the gradual dismantling of borders from the outside; multiculturalism weakens nationality, thus delegitimizing their existence altogether from the inside. !e idea of political organization that fundamentally opposes <b>supranationalism</b> and multiculturalism – the idea of the nation state – has been declared ‘outdated’ and ‘irrelevant’ by an overwhelming number of commentators.
