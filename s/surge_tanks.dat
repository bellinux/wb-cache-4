Finally, the effects of penstock are analysed by using stability region and response curves. The {{results indicate that the}} stability and regulation quality of system without <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> are determined by time response of frequency which only depends on water hammer wave in penstock, while, for system with <b>surge</b> <b>tank,</b> the time response of frequency depending on water hammer wave in penstock and water-level fluctuation in <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> jointly determines the stability and regulation quality.

40|$|Abstract – {{in nuclear}} power plants using {{pressurized}} water as the main coolant maintaining system pressure within prescribed limits is necessary. The volume of the main coolant expands and contracts with average temperature variations causing insurges and outsurges in the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> volume which is called "pressurizer". The <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> acts {{in a way in}} which coolant pressure is maintained within prescribed limits. The <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> is equipped with a spray and relief system as well as electric heating elements. The pressure is controlled by the increase in bubble populations through heating and / or flashing or steam condensation through water sprays. This paper analyses the transient behavior of the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> in a WWER type pressurized water nuclear power plant. An analytical method is developed for predicting pressure and water level variations in the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> following in or out surge processes. The analysis also takes into consideration the variation of the thermodynamic mass qualities inside the <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> The results obtained are compared with RELAP 5 /Mod 3 and RELAP 5 /Mod 2 as valid codes.

Transient analysis is important {{and one of the}} more challenging and complicated flow problem in the design and the operation of water pipeline systems. Transient can produce large pressure forces and rapid fluid acceleration into a water pipeline system, these disturbances may result in device failures, system fatigue or pipe ruptures, and even the dirty water intrusion. Several methods have been introduced and used to analyze transient flow, an accurate analysis and suitable protection devices should be used to protect water pipeline systems. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method has been used to solve the dynamic and continuity equations in the rigid column method, while the characteristics method used to solve these equations in the full elastic method. The results obtained provide that the model is an efficient tool for flow transient analysis and provide approximately identical results by using these two methods.
