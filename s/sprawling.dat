A problem with empirically examining the relationship between <b>sprawl</b> and transportation externalities is that <b>sprawl</b> is a difficult concept to quantify. This paper uses a measure of <b>sprawl</b> designed by Ewing, Pendall, and Chen (2002) {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>sprawl</b> and commute times, automobile ownership, miles driven, fatal auto accidents, air pollution, and highway expenditures.

Firstly literature survey on urban <b>sprawl</b> and urban fringe was examined. Geographic Information System was used to define and map urban <b>sprawl.</b> Daily trip production in <b>sprawl</b> and urban core was analyzed. In addition daily travel behavior was inquired. For this study, 2007 İstanbul Master Plan Household and O-D survey was also used. It allows comparisons travel behavior between <b>sprawl</b> and urban core area. The results confirmed that there is no much difference on socio economic situation between people living in urban <b>sprawl</b> area and people living in urban core area. However using of private car is higher rate in <b>sprawl</b> area than urban core. In addition <b>sprawl</b> population drive more time and distance than urban population. The results provide important insights into the importance of <b>sprawl</b> on transportation and suggest that transportation system can be adversely affected to the extent that cities continue to expand to urban <b>sprawl</b> areas as wanton. As a consequence, <b>sprawl</b> effects İstanbul transportation as negative because <b>sprawl</b> affects travel behavior.

40|$|Urban <b>sprawl</b> {{is one of}} the avidly urban issues today. “Sprawling” {{means the}} {{spreading}} of urban area towards rural area surrounding it. There are different social and economic factors which led to urban <b>sprawl.</b> The study of urban <b>sprawl</b> in this paper attempts to measure the <b>sprawl</b> of urban areas into rural areas and the type of <b>sprawl</b> and the pre-dominant causes responsible for <b>sprawl.</b> It first reviews and analyses past research on the definitions of urban form, compactness and <b>sprawl,</b> and corresponding quantitative variables. Measures of urban <b>sprawl</b> will be identified and procedures will be developed to compute these indicators in GIS environment. The indicators of <b>sprawl</b> defined by (Galster et al, 2001) are considered as major characteristics of <b>sprawl</b> which have been adopted in this paper to develop a set of variables for quantification, characterization and dimension of <b>sprawl.</b> The study has been done on grid level (Grid Size = 500 m x 500 m). The density index shows that in 2001 Rajkot had 9292 persons per grid of 500 meters x 500 meters which has decreased to 7394 persons per grid which shows that the population is moving from center to outer fringes.

In developing countries like India, where the population is over one billion, one-sixth of the world’s population, urban <b>sprawl</b> is taking its toll on the natural resources at an alarming pace. Urban planners require information related to the rate of growth, pattern and extent of <b>sprawl</b> to provide basic amenities such as water, sanitation, electricity, etc. In the absence of such information, most of the <b>sprawl</b> areas lack basic infrastructure facilities. Pattern and extent of <b>sprawl</b> could be modelled with the help of spatial and temporal data.

40|$|Abstract: Urban <b>sprawl</b> {{refers to}} the {{outgrowth}} of urban areas caused by uncontrolled, uncoordinated and unplanned growth. This outgrowth seen along the periphery of cities, along highways, and along roads connecting a city, lacks basic amenities like sanitation, treated water supply, primary health centre, etc. as planners were unable to visualise such growth during planning, policy and decision-making. <b>Sprawl</b> generally infers to some type of uncoordinated development with impacts such as loss of agricultural land, open space and ecologically sensitive habitats in and around urban areas {{due to lack of}} integrated and holistic approaches in regional planning. In developing countries, where urbanisation rates are high, urban <b>sprawl</b> is a significant contributor of the land use change. However, characterising <b>sprawl</b> has become a contentious issue with numerous arguments both for and against the phenomenon. Meanwhile, effective metrics to characterise <b>sprawl</b> in India are required to characterise this.
