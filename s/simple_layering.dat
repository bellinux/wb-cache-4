40|$|Introduction The {{problem of}} {{attenuation}} of multiples is of permanent interest for theoreticians {{as well as}} for practical geophysicists (e. g. [1]). Classical approaches to suppression of multiples exploit a well-seen self-repetition of wave-forms, resulting in a rather high correlation of primaries and respective multiples (coherent-, or waveform preserved-, reverberations). In a routine processing of marine data it gives a good result, when the multiples are associated mainly with the water-layer reverberations in a locally 1 D-environment, with a fairly <b>simple</b> <b>layering</b> of a sea-bed. Multiple Suppression via Envelopes (let us call it MSvE), exposed here, aims to deal with elimination of multiples which are incoherent, albeit well-seen, with primaries. Losses of coherency can be of different physical grounds, while the relevant statistical aspects are general for the transition: wave/transfer phenomena. The coherency losses can b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{utilization}} of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) overlay networks on mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) introduces new services and possibilities such as context based routing and location based services (LBS). A <b>simple</b> <b>layering</b> of both networks is inefficient {{and does not}} scale well because the virtual P 2 P overlay network does not match the frequently changing physical network topology of the MANET. The Mobile Peer-to-Peer (MPP) protocol stack offers a very promising concept by introducing a cross-layer communication channel between the physical network layer and the virtual P 2 P network layer. This reduces significantly the messaging overhead and increases the search success rate, as we can prove in this work. Therefore we describe an implementation of the MPP protocol stack in the Network Simulator 2 (ns- 2). With this implementation we prove the significant performance improvements which can be achieved with MPP, to allow P 2 P networking in mobile ad hoc environments...|$|E

In this paper we “extend ” the wireline result to the wireless context. In particular, we show the following meta-theorem: if for a given channel and its reciprocal channel, the cut-set bound is (approximately) achievable, then for multiple-unicast in a bidirected network comprised of such channels, the cut-set bound is (approximately) achievable within a logarithmic factor {{of the number of}} sources. The achievable scheme can be viewed as an instantiation of a <b>simple</b> <b>layering</b> principle: local physical-layer schemes combined with global routing. We use the reciprocity of the wireless channel critically in this result. We prove this result formally as a capacity approximation result for a variety of channel models, including general Gaussian networks under fast fading, networks comprised only of broadcast and MAC channels, and networks comprised of broadcast erasure channels with feedback. The capacity approximations we prove tend to have both an additive gap (power loss) and a multiplicative gap (degrees of freedom loss).

Layers can be built independently of each other by cascades. In the first layer, for each class of attack recognition, there is a corresponding network and correctness is checked on this network. To learn this layer, we have chosen classes of things that can be classified uniquely as yes or no, that is, they are linearly separable. Thus, a layer is obtained not just of neurons, but of their microsets, which can best determine whether is there some data class in the query or not. The following layers are not trained to recognize the attacks themselves, they are trained that a set of attacks creates certain threats. This allows you to more accurately recognize the attacker's attempts to bypass the defense system, as well as classify the target of the attack, and not just its fact. <b>Simple</b> <b>layering</b> allows you to minimize the percentage of false positives. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{investigates the}} {{utilization}} of mineral wool (glasswool and rockwool) as precursor with metakaolin in geopolymerization. In 2015, mineral wool waste in Europe {{is estimated to be}} 2. 4 metric tonnes, and it is currently landfilled. The utilization of this waste in geopolymer composites is one of the motivation towards this study. Indeed, addition of these mineral wools to metakaolin-based geopolymers matrices showed significant improvement in the mechanical properties. The literature section of this thesis describes the previous knowledge on geopolymerization, the materials used in geopolymer and the factors affecting the mechanical strength. In the experimental part, the first goal was to achieve mix composition with highest mechanical strength and also a workable paste of geopolymers. This was done with the following factors held constant: SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 3. 8 and Na₂O/Al₂O₃ = 1, and varying the following: H₂O/Na₂O from 10 to 13, SiO₂/Na₂O from 3. 21 to 4. 02, mineral wool/metakaolin mass ratio from 0 – 1, and water/binder (w/b) mass ratio from 0. 42 to 0. 55. The different mix compositions was calculated at varying substitution (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) of metakaolin with mineral wool using both glasswool and rockwool in different matrices to determine the effect of mineral wool substitution on the properties of the geopolymer. Mechanical strength tests were done {{to determine the effects of}} mineral wool addition in the geopolymer. Results from the test shows maximum compressive strength of 33 MPa when 20 % of the metakaolin was substituted with mineral wool. Further substitution was observed to reduce the mechanical properties of the geopolymer. Also, optimization of glasswool and rockwool in different compositional mixes was done to select a particular mineral wool to be used further in the course of the study. Glasswool precursor with metakaolin showed better compressive strength using the chosen SiO₂/Al₂O₃ and Na₂O/Al₂O₃-ratios, compared to rockwool and was continued as the co-binder with metakaolin during reinforcement with fibres. Additionally, during the investigation the matrices were cured at various temperatures (50, 60, 80 and 100 °C). Results showed best mechanical strength was achieved when the geopolymer matrices were cured at 50 °C. XRD and TGA where used to characterize the behaviour of the raw materials and geopolymer samples and to verify geopolymer formations and its thermal stability respectively. Geopolymers in general during testing experiences brittle failure, this limitation can be corrected using fibre reinforcement. Geopolymer composites with glass, carbon and cotton/polyester fibres were investigated using a <b>simple</b> <b>layering</b> method. Data from these preliminary tests showed that cotton/polyester blend fibre exhibited better ductility and flexural strength than glass and carbon fibre...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Hortofruticultura e Viticultura - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaWith the {{increasing}} of blackberry production worldwide, {{the search for}} new production systems has been ceaseless. Considering the extension of vegetative growth in mild winter climates regions, from March until November, and the huge amounts of hardwood wasted with pruning, three trials were accomplished aiming to exploit these features. In the first trial, floricane stem cuttings of three blackberry cultivars, ‘Arapaho’, ‘Ouachita’ and ‘Karaka Black’, were taken on 15 th February 2011 from three different positions in the cane: apical, mid, and basal sections, and rooted in substrate under intermittent moist conditions. The mean percentage of rooted stem cuttings differed significantly (P< 0, 05) between cultivars and cane position, with better results for top part of the cane than for bottom and middle parts. Differentiation state, lateral diameter and number of flower per lateral {{were not significantly different}} between treatments. It was observed that rotting occurred both from nodes and at base of the cuttings. After the fruiting lateral branch flowered, a vegetative behavior was observed with growth of several vegetative laterals. ‘Ouachita’ was the cultivar which produced the greater dry mass weight of vegetative laterals. Incomplete drupelet set was also observed. In a second trial, which studied the factors that could influence floricane stem cuttings rooting, hardhood cuttings of ‘Apache’ were rooted under three different conditions (light, sucrose and cut in the base of the axillary bud). Considering that none of these conditions led to roots production, the influence of each factor was studied based on the amount of callus formation. It was observed both for cuts in ends and in the base of the axillary bud of cuttings, that callus formation was dependent of light, with an increase of callus amount formed in its presence. The addition of sucrose negatively influenced the formation of callus at the base of cuttings. Lastly, a trial with nine blackberry cultivars of different types, (‘Olallie’, ‘Silvan’, ‘Karaka Black’, ‘Kotata’, ‘Boysenberry’, ‘Ouachita’, ‘Loch Tay’, ‘Chester Thornless’ and ‘Logan Thornless’) was conducted with the purpose of evaluate the cultivar suitability for double cropping in early spring and late autumn production, through production of long-cane from primocanes. For each cultivar, in half of plants, floricanes were suppressed and other half was maintained. Plants without floricanes did not produce more primocanes per plant than plants with floricanes. Plants without floricanes produced primocanes that had significantly greater cane lengths and node number but lower diameters.
