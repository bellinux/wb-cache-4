5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information. A <b>spreadsheet</b> can be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for each cell and an edge whenever the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological ordering of this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the <b>spreadsheet</b> is changed.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a <b>spreadsheet</b> changes, it is {{necessary}} to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the <b>spreadsheet.</b> Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole <b>spreadsheet</b> to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems {{of this type}} concern collections of objects {{that need to be}} updated, such as the cells of a <b>spreadsheet</b> after one of the cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spreadsheets</b> {{are widely}} used {{end-user}} programming tools. Since many critical decisions are made based on values computed by <b>spreadsheets,</b> the correctness of <b>spreadsheets</b> is crucial. The application of tried and tested software engineering principles to <b>spreadsheets</b> seems to promise help with the construction and maintenance of dependable <b>spreadsheets.</b> However, can we really make this practical for end users? In this article we demonstrate with two examples, type checking and debugging, that we can exploit the idiosyncratic structure of <b>spreadsheets</b> to successfully translate these concepts to an end-user programming domain. We argue that the simplified computational model and the rich context {{information provided by the}} spatial embedding of formulas allow, in particular, the simplification of these concepts, which ultimately leads to effective tools for end users. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of <b>spreadsheets</b> in {{budgeting}} in order to explain how and why <b>spreadsheets</b> are used or not used in budgeting practice. Guided by modern budgeting research, budgeting is considered as a social phenomenon which requires flexibility for decision-making and integration for management control. Twenty-one interviews with business controllers in eleven leading for-profit organisations in Thailand were conducted for this study. The analysis at the activity level, led by the concept of ‘conflict’ in structuration theory (ST), reveals that <b>spreadsheets</b> allow a full flexibility over decision-making activities in budgeting. However, <b>spreadsheets</b> are not appropriate for integration in management control as there are many problems and errors associated with {{the use of}} <b>spreadsheets.</b> The analysis at the structural level, directed by the concept of ‘contradiction’ in ST, concludes that the weak characteristics of <b>spreadsheets</b> for integration are contradictory to the budgeting process which fulfils the dual roles of flexibility and integration. This study concludes that use of <b>spreadsheets</b> in budgeting is significant despite the availability of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and business intelligence (BI). This study explains that <b>spreadsheets</b> are heavily used because of (1) the lack of integration between financial and management accounting functions and (2) the fit for <b>spreadsheets</b> to support the flexibility in decision-making. This paper offers two contributions. First, it shows an over-reliance on <b>spreadsheets</b> for management accounting practice. Second, it informs academia and practitioners of the need to reduce their reliance on <b>spreadsheets</b> for management control functions because there are many drawbacks associated with it...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} word processor, <b>spreadsheet,</b> database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E
