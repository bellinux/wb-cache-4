50|$|The <b>shagreen</b> <b>ray</b> or fuller's ray, Leucoraja fullonica, is {{a species}} of skate in the family Rajidae. This ray {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Murmansk, Russia through Norway, {{southern}} Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Celtic Sea, the northern North Sea and Skagerrak, to northern Morocco, including (infrequently) the western Mediterranean Sea and the Madeira Islands. It is absent from the shallow waters off England and Wales.|$|E
5000|$|This species {{occurs in}} {{relatively}} {{cold water on}} the upper continental slopes {{at a depth of}} 30-550 m. It is most common at depths of 200 m, but is found deeper in southern areas. It favors sandy and possibly also rocky habitats. The <b>shagreen</b> <b>ray</b> feeds on a variety of benthic animals, mainly fishes but also crustaceans. Like other skates reproduction is oviparous; the egg capsules are amber in color and oblong-shaped, with long, stiff horns at each corner. One pair of horns are longer than the capsule. The capsules measure 7.5-9.9 cm long and 4.5-4.7 cm wide. Historically this ray was considered of [...] "inferior" [...] quality for consumption. It is caught commercially by longlines and trawls.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th century, the {{bottlenose}} skate was prized by the French for food. Because of {{its large}} size and slow reproductive rate, the bottlenose skate is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. Anecdotal data {{suggests that there}} has been a substantial decline in the abundance and geographical range of this species in the north Atlantic and Mediterranean. In the north Atlantic, populations of bottlenose skates have declined severely or disappeared from the Bay of Biscay and the Irish Sea; there are no longer targeted fisheries in these regions due to localized population collapses in the 1960s. There are also no recent records of this species in the waters off the United Kingdom, where it historically occurred. The bottlenose ray still persists along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, though the population data is uncertain due to confusion with the <b>shagreen</b> <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja fullonica) and the sandy ray (L. circularis).|$|E

5000|$|Shagreen {{is a form}} of {{roughened}} untanned leather, typically dyed {{green and}} commonly made of the skins of sharks and rays. The common name [...] "fuller's ray" [...] comes from an instrument used by fullers to smooth cloth, referring to its rough and spiny back. [...] The pectoral fin disc of the <b>shagreen</b> <b>ray</b> is somewhat wider than it is long. The forward margin [...] and undulated, and about one-third longer than the rear margin. The snout is cone-shaped and pointed. The tail is shorter than the disc, with two small, equally sized dorsal fins and a rudimentary caudal fin. The eyes and mouth are large; the teeth are pointed and number about 64 in the upper jaw and 56 in the lower. The upper surface is rough in texture, with patches of large spines on the snout, around the eyes, and on the shoulder. There are two rows of about 50 spines each running {{from the center of the}} back to the first dorsal fin, and no interdorsal spine. The underside is smooth except for the front edge of the disc, base of the tail, and tail. The coloration is a uniform gray or brown with smaller darker dots above, and white below. The maximum size is to 120 cm long.|$|E
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and <b>shagreen</b> <b>ray</b> (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
