5|$|In 1974, Thulborn {{suggested}} that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, who argued that the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.|$|E

Therefore, its function is considered to be helping the fish establish a hierarchy among other males where those with larger kypes are dominant over animals with smaller kypes, and/or characteristics that could be of importance in inter- and intra-sexual evaluations of individual quality.

25|$|Although fine vellus hair {{is present}} in the area in childhood, pubic hair is {{considered}} to be the heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of androgens in males and estrogens in females. Pubic hair is part of a person's body hair and a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Many cultures regard pubic hair to be erotic, and in most cultures pubic hair is associated with genitalia, which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times. In some cultures, it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed, especially of females, a practice which is regarded as part of personal hygiene. In other cultures, the exposure of pubic hair (for example, when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing, and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic</b> and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E

50|$|Tusks have {{a variety}} of uses {{depending}} on the animal. Social displays of dominance, particularly among males, are common, as is their use in defense against attackers.

40|$|In this study, pubertal {{development}} was examined for {{a sample of}} children and adolescents with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS) defined as psychosis by age 12. Developmental and psychiatric histories were obtained for 28 adolescents (mean age 14. 5 +/- 2. 3 years) with severe, treatment refractory COS (14 males, 14 females). Age of onset of psychosis was also examined in relation to menarche and development of <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Girls had a trend towards developing <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics</b> earlier than boys (P = 0. 06), consistent with North American norms. Males (N = 14) and females (N = 14) had similar age of onset of psychosis. The age of development of <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics</b> was associated with onset of psychosis for girls, but this finding was driven by one outlier. There was no significant correlation between development of psychosis and menarche. Neither male nor female probands differed significantly from their well siblings or from North American norms in their age of onset of pubertal development. There was no evidence of early onset of <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics</b> for this sample. Finally, there was an absence of a clear relationship between onset of psychosis and indices of sexual development for these very early onset cases...|$|R

50|$|The pubic area is {{particularly}} sensitive to such hormones, {{as are the}} armpits which will develop axillary hair. Pubic and axillary hair will develop on both men and women, {{to the extent that}} such hair qualifies as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic,</b> although males will develop terminal hair in more areas. This includes facial hair, chest hair, abdominal hair, leg and arm hair, and foot hair. Human females on the other hand can be expected to retain more of the vellus hair.|$|E

In Paraprotopteryx they may have served as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> However, although the presence of two ribbon-like rectrices is certain (as in the related enantiornithine bird Protopteryx) there is a suspicion that the second pair of rectrices might be the result of artifice.|$|E

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics</b> in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|R
50|$|Hair {{has great}} social {{significance}} for human beings. It can grow on most external {{areas of the}} human body, except on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (among other areas).

These include the face, ears, head, eyebrows, legs, and armpits, as well as the pubic region. The highly visible differences between male and female body and facial hair are a notable <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Scientists have {{hypothesized}} that non-paraphilic sexual attraction to breasts {{is the result}} of their function as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic.</b> For instance, zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks, which according to Morris in The Naked Ape is also unique to humans, other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks. Evolutionary psychologists theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during ovulation, allows human females to [...] "solicit human male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile".|$|E
5000|$|Many {{of the genera}} {{also have}} a gland {{situated}} in the gill cavity called a [...] "gill gland", a <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>characteristic</b> found in sexually mature male glandulocaudines that is apparently suited to release chemical signals. No genus contains species that have glands and other species without glands. This gill gland is derived from anterior gill filaments of the first gill arch.
