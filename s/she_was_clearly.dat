5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, {{probably}} that Easter and certainly by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E
25|$|Her grief {{destroyed}} her health, and by {{the middle}} of March <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> dying.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> a Danish (or {{at least}} 'half-Danish') princess, who had married Finn, prince of the Frisians, doubtless a {{political}} move to secure peace between Danes and Frisians. Hildeburh had a brother, Hnæf, who apparently went to Finn with his Danish retinue in friendship.|$|E
50|$|Bettany {{announces that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> pregnant. Tiphani tells Danilo {{that she has}} {{abandoned}} her husband and now goes by the name, Tiphani Luminosa. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> mad.|$|R

25|$|In {{the film}} Tombstone, Wyatt Earp's first wife {{frequently}} speaks of her need for laudanum. Although <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not described as such in the film, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> an addict.|$|R
25|$|During {{the time}} Genie {{lived with the}} Riglers, {{everyone}} who worked with her reported that her mood significantly improved and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> content with her life. As late as June 1975, David Rigler wrote that Genie continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing, and Curtiss' contemporaneous accounts expressed some optimism about Genie's social development. Nonetheless, even by mid-1975 most social interactions with her remained abnormal in quality. The scientists wrote that, while her overall demeanor and interactions with others had significantly improved, many aspects of her behavior remained characteristic of an unsocialized person.|$|E
25|$|Haig gave Foch {{the same}} advice at the Senlis Conference (25 October) – he was privately {{suspicious}} of French plans {{to occupy the}} Rhineland, writing to his wife (1 November) that {{the peace of the}} world for the next fifty years depended on not driving Germany to seek future revenge by humiliating her. He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision to save lives and money by offering Germany an armistice once <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany had not really been defeated. The Allies agreed to offer peace {{on the basis of the}} Fourteen Points with a British opt-out for Point 2 (Freedom of the Seas).|$|E
25|$|Medical {{quarantine}} checkpoints instituted by Peter I {{and expanded}} by Catherine II were sufficient to prevent plague from reaching {{inside the country}} in peacetime, but they proved to be inadequate in time of war. The system regarded all epidemics as external threats, focusing on border control, and paid less attention to domestic measures. The epidemic blocked the logistics of Rumyantsev's army, and as the state tried to push more reserves and supplies to the theatre, peacetime quarantine controls had to be lifted. Plague swept into Poland and Ukraine; by August 1770 it reached Bryansk. Catherine refused to admit the plague in public, although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> aware {{of the nature and}} proportions of the threat, as evidenced by her letters to Governor of Moscow Pyotr Saltykov.|$|E

50|$|Susan Yazdan - the {{daughter}} of Sami and Ziba, adopted from Korea at six months of age. Susan {{may be seen as}} “bossy” to Jin Ho, but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> the apple of her parents’ eye.|$|R
25|$|After a {{few weeks}} Genie became much more {{responsive}} to other people, and shortly afterwards began paying attention to people speaking, but at first she remained mostly unexpressive and {{it was unclear whether}} she responded more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli. Shortly afterwards Genie showed clear responses to nonverbal signals, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional. A month into her stay Genie started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon after with other hospital staff. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> happy when someone she knew visited and sometimes worked very hard to get a person to stay, expressing disappointment if she failed; for no discernible reason, her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left. After the state dropped charges against Genie's mother she began visiting Genie twice a week, and {{over the course of a}} few months they steadily grew better at interacting with each other.|$|E
25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E
500|$|The single {{greatest}} {{loss of life}} resulting from a submarine attack in Australian waters occurred {{in the early hours}} of 14 May 1943 when [...] torpedoed and sank the Australian hospital ship Centaur off Point Lookout, Queensland. After being hit by a single torpedo, Centaur sank in less than three minutes with the loss of 268 lives. While hospital ships—such as Centaur—were legally protected against attack under the terms of the Geneva Conventions, it is unclear whether Commander Hajime Nakagawa of I-177 was aware that Centaur was a hospital ship. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> marked with a red cross and was fully illuminated, the light conditions at the time may have resulted in Nakagawa not being aware of [...] Centaurs status, making her sinking a tragic accident. However, as Nakagawa had a poor record as a submarine captain and was later convicted of machine gunning the survivors of a British merchant ship in the Indian Ocean, it is probable that the sinking of Centaur was due to either Nakagawa's incompetence or indifference to the laws of warfare. The attack on Centaur sparked widespread public outrage in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Pandora Box: Box's {{younger sister}} {{is prone to}} {{adopting}} fringe causes with a fanatical passion for brief periods of time. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> said to have lived by the sea and written a number of pamphlets. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> in love with Olympus Mons, the leader of FAUST.|$|R
5000|$|Right now she ranks {{between one}} of the highest rated stars in Romania. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> {{one of the}} most desired divas. Certain local [...] "men's magazines" [...] offered more than €10,000 for a photoshoot of her getting naked, although, she refused the offer.|$|R
50|$|In the Baʿal Epic of Ugarit, Athirat, the consort {{of the god}} El, plays a role. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> {{distinguished}} from Ashtart in the Ugaritic documents, although in non-Ugaritic sources from later periods {{the distinction between the}} two goddesses can be blurred; either as a result of scribal error or through possible syncretism.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard smiled gravely, for he {{recognized}} that while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> grieved to hear of young Radcliffe's death, she could have had no particular tenderness for the unfortunate lad.|$|E
60|$|I {{was growing}} excited, but she {{interrupted}} {{me with an}} “Oh, I see,” and her voice sounded weary. To think was patently an effort. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> {{on the verge of}} physical collapse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} there'd been any one else," [...] said Rachel. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> surprised, but all {{they said was}} said low and inexpressively, because they were {{speaking}} out into the cool dark night.|$|E

[...] "She maun keep {{the company that}} her brother keeps, for <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> dependent.--But, {{speaking}} of that, I ken what I have to do, and that is no little, before it darkens. I have sat clavering with you ower lang, Maister Francie." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Ermina appears at Bromfield, {{accompanied}} by a stranger who immediately vanishes. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> filled with remorse that her reckless conduct led indirectly to Hilaria's death, but Cadfael insists that the guilt belongs to her murderer. She tells Cadfael that the stranger is Olivier de Bretagne, a Syrian-born squire in her uncle's service, with whom <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> in love.|$|R

'When {{she finds}} {{how much we}} know, and how we know it,' he said, 'and that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> {{compromised}} already, we are not without strong hopes {{that we may be}} enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually. If we could do that, she might go scot-free for aught I cared.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned toward}} {{him for the first}} time. In her new position, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> visible in the light. He looked at her attentively. [...] "I have seen you somewhere," [...] he said, [...] "before now." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had not {{the time}} to scream, the {{enveloping}} scarf smothered her cry even as it formed in her throat. The last thing of which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> conscious was of a voice--which strangely enough sounded familiar--saying hurriedly: ...|$|E
60|$|Wyllard smiled gravely, for he {{recognised}} {{that while}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> grieved {{to hear of}} his death, she could have had no particular tenderness for the unfortunate lad. He was, however, a little off his guard just then.|$|E

When Tasty finds Cheryl and Ice Cold in bed, N.W.H. is no more.|$|R

60|$|With {{a bitter}} droop of her lower lip, she nodded, and {{suddenly}} {{put her hand}} to her heart. That action, of which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> unconscious, so naively, so almost automatically was it done, nearly put an end to Hilary's determination.|$|E
6000|$|His {{discrimination}} was a wonder; {{but since}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> treating him now {{as if everything}} about him was, so she could as exquisitely meet it.

6000|$|... "Never sang {{a note in}} my life," [...] she said, {{obviously}} {{surprised by}} the irrelevant question; for {{they had not been}} discoursing of sweet sounds. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> unaware of her voice.

50|$|The second {{stripper}} is Dallas, {{played by}} Miss Oahu Lyanna Tumaneng. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> the most courageous of the trio, as she braved zombie attacks {{to get the}} zombie antidote from the laboratory.

At the same time <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a nice girl, not at all calculating, and will be a good stepmother to the widowed Squire's daughter. It is unclear what her relationship with her father was like, there is no suggestion that she feels the bitter antagonism her brother's feel. <b>She</b> would <b>clearly</b> <b>be</b> horrified if <b>she</b> knew of the manner of his death and the role of her brothers in it.|$|R
