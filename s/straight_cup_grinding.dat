40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} extremely-thin Si wafers is expanding. Current {{manufacturing}} technologies are meeting great challenges with the continuous decrease in Si wafer thickness. In this study, a novel single step thinning process for extremely thin Si wafers was {{put forward by}} use of an integrated <b>cup</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel (ICGW) in which diamond segments and chemo-mechanical grinding (CMG) segments are alternately allocated along the wheel periphery. The basic machining principle and key technologies were introduced in detail. Grinding experiments were performed on 8 -in. Si wafers with a developed ICGW to explore the minimal wafer thickness and grinding performance. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed grinding process with the ICGW is an available thinning approach for extremely thin Si wafer down to 15 µm...|$|R
