In order to reject the star flux and detect the planet flux in the visible light range, the coronagraph telescope must achieve a rejection ratio on the order of a billion to one. Dynamic jitter, introduced by environmental and on-board mechanical disturbances, degrades the optical performance, as characterized primarily by contrast ratio. The feasibility of using passive vibration isolation combined with active attitude and line-of- sight control systems to stabilize the spacecraft and the optical components to the requisite level is being studied.

40|$|Three {{magnetosheath}} passes with density enhancements {{in front}} of the magnetopause are studied with data from ISEE 1, 2, and 3. The density structure appears to be locally generated and <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> in nature. In one pass when ISEE 1 and 2 were well separated, the motion of the density structure can be determined. The density structure appears to stand in the magnetosheath flow. Thus, it propagates upstream in the rest frame of the flow. The flow in and near the density structure appears to be closer to isothermal than adiabatic. The flow velocity decreases from super-slow to being close to the intermediate and <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> velocities at {{the outer edge of the}} density structure.

40|$|The plasma {{depletion}} layer (PDL) is a layer on the sunward {{side of the}} magnetopause with lower plasma density and higher magnetic field compared to their corresponding values in the upstream magnetosheath. The {{depletion layer}} usually occurs during northward&nbsp;(IMF) conditions with low magnetic shear across the magnetopause. We have previously validated the Raeder global model by comparing the computed formation of a magnetosheath density depletion with in-situ observations. We also have performed a detailed force analysis and found the varying roles that different MHD forces play along {{the path of a}} plasma parcel flowing around the magnetopause. That study resulted in a new description of the behavior of magnetosheath magnetic flux tubes which better explains the plasma depletion along a flux tube. The <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> waves have been observed in the magnetosheath and have been used to explain the formation of the PDL in some of the important PDL models. In this study, we extend our former work by investigating the possible role of the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> waves for the formation of the PDL, using global MHD model simulations. We propose a new technique to test where a possible <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> front may occur in the magnetosheath by comparing the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> group velocity with the local flow velocity. We find that the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> fronts can exist in certain regions in the magnetosheath under certain solar wind conditions. The existence and location of such fronts clearly depend on the IMF. We do not see from our global simulation results either the sharpening of the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> front into a <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> shock or noticeable changes of the flow and field in the magnetosheath across the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> front, which implies that the <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> front is not likely responsible for the formation of the PDL, at least for the stable solar wind conditions used in these simulations.

The presence of <b>slow</b> <b>modes</b> within elastic waveguides has remained unexplored and so potential applications have not been exploited.

We consider analytically how a drifting ion species (e. g.

For wavevectors highly oblique to the magnetic field, we find solutions that are characterized by very small perturbations of total pressure. Thus, our results may help to distinguish the MHD <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> from kinetic Alfv\'en waves and non-propagating pressure-balanced structures, which can also have very small total pressure perturbations. 2. For small ion concentrations, there are solutions that are similar to the usual <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> in an electron-proton plasma, and solutions that are dominated by the drifting ions, but for small drifts the wave modes cannot be simply characterized. 3. Even with zero ion drift, the standard dispersion relation for the highly oblique <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> cannot be used with the Alfv\'en speed computed using the summed proton and ion densities, and with the sound speed computed from the summed pressures and densities of all species. 4.

We find that the convective downdrafts in the immediate surroundings of magnetic elements {{are responsible for the}} excitation of <b>slow</b> <b>modes.</b> The coupling between the external downdraft and the plasma motion internal to the flux concentration is mediated by the inertial forces of the downdraft that act on the magnetic flux concentration. These forces, in conjunction with the downward movement, pump the internal atmosphere in the downward direction, which entails a fast downdraft in the photospheric and chromospheric layers of the magnetic element. Subsequent to the transient pumping phase, the atmosphere rebounds, causing a <b>slow</b> <b>mode</b> traveling along the magnetic flux concentration in the upward direction.
