50|$|In 1994, Torsburgen was {{designated}} as a nature reserve. The reserve comprises the whole plateau and the area immediately surrounding its base, which translates to 158 ha. The flora includes a number of plants that are rare in Sweden, such as hard shield-ferns, <b>scorpion</b> <b>senna,</b> Orobanche alba and the Pulsatilla vulgaris gotlandica; all of which survived the fire in 1992. On 30August 2005, the nature reserve became a Natura 2000 protected area. A number of endangered species of plants and insects on the IUCN Red List have been found within the area.|$|E
50|$|Four {{different}} {{mechanisms of}} pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively {{known as the}} explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms. In the explosive or tripping mechanism (cf. alfalfa, common broom, ox-eye bean) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (cf. <b>scorpion</b> <b>senna)</b> pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen {{through a hole in}} the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen.|$|E
