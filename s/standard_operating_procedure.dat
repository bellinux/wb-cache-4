5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E

25|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that the incident {{did not appear to be}} linked to organized international terrorist groups. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs reaffirmed what Homeland Security said, and that President Barack Obama was briefed on the incident. The President expressed his concern and commended the courageous actions of the first responders. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) launched two F-16 fighter aircraft from Ellington Airport in Houston, Texas, to conduct an air patrol in response to the crash.

25|$|On May 2012, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) {{released}} its final {{report on the}} investigation. It determined that a visual approach {{should not have been}} attempted due to low visibility. There was no checklist reading or crew briefing. The flight crew lacked situation awareness while trying to locate the runway and while performing the go-around. The aircraft entered a rapid descent during the go-around due to a 38-degree left roll and crew commanded flap retraction from 15 to 0 degrees. Both crew members had low experience and flying time on type. The inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the training program may lead to actions that deviate from <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> and that regress to a previous aircraft type.|$|E

The purpose of research is knowing influence the level of knowledge and attitudes of nurses toward the implementation of <b>Standard</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Procedures</b> in infusion. This research used descriptive quantitative research methods with cross sectional. The respondent of it is nurses working in the emergency department of PKU Muhammadiyah Hospital Bantul. Data was collected using a questionnaires and observation. The analytical tool used are univariate, bivariate, and multivariate. Results {{is the level of}} knowledge most of nurses in good category (80, 00 %), the attitude of most of the nurses has a good category (53, 33 %) and the application of <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> infusion majority of categories has been implemented (53, 33 %). There is a relationship between the level of knowledge and the application of <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> (p< 0, 05).

The NCIS described the detainees bonds as loose and easily tied by the prisoners, and {{said that the}}y did not have to climb to the sinks for hanging. Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> (SOP) when criminal actions are possible). The NCIS report notes that numerous guards, detainees and medical personnel attested to seeing the deceased being transferred from the cellblock to the infirmary.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure.</b> It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
25|$|Krohn's {{work also}} {{sheds light on}} Hitchcock's {{practice}} of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this {{and a great deal}} of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each film poster for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as Bill Gold and Saul Bass—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.|$|E

500|$|Allegations {{regarding}} {{the treatment of}} Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin, the second highest-ranked member of Canada’s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> for Afghan interrogators. This would be consistent with special reports by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the US Department of State. Colvin also said the torture involved beatings, whipping with power cables, the use of electricity, knives, open flames and rape. The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day. [...] "There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces", Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the House of Commons, with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was not credible.|$|E
500|$|Since it was {{no longer}} {{possible}} to abort the takeoff at this point, the crew followed the <b>standard</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure</b> for an [...] "engine out" [...] climb. This procedure is to climb at the takeoff safety airspeed (V2) and attitude (angle), as directed by the flight director. The partial electrical power failure (produced by the separation of the left No. 1 engine) meant that neither the stall warning nor slat retraction indicator was operative. The crew was, therefore, unaware that the slats on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing. Thus flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift, so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left. Later, in simulator recreations of the accident, it was determined that by climbing at a higher airspeed the crash could have been averted.|$|E
