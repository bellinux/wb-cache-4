40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the profile of elderly residents in long-stay institutions {{in the south of}} the country, identifying the perception of people about the institution. It also aimed {{to identify the}} perception of the other residents, employees, of nursing care and to discuss and reflect about nursing care to the elderly living in long stay institutions. This is a qualitative exploratory-descriptive research, which was done in a long-stay institution in Rio Grande do Sul. The subjects were seniors living in this place. We used for collecting the data an interview guide and the recording. After the analysis, the data were grouped by the profile of participants, about the perception of older residents and employees of the institution, and perception of nursing care they received. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> and reflected on the nursing care for elderly residents in long-stay institutions, considering the current context of the writings of Brazilian nurses. This study may contribute to the nursing gerontogeriatry, providing grants to improve the health of institutionalized elderly. ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} a general {{description of the}} world money development in both developed and developing countries {{during the second half}} of 20 th century. We were primarily focusing on the long run trends in dollar gold prices, monetary aggregates (broad and narrow money), foreign exchange reserves, inflation and interest rates. We found that after relatively tranquil periods of fifties and sixties, next three decades witnessed dramatic changes in the world economy. The emphasis that was given to the analysis of the relation of the dollar gold prices to the world reserve currencies (EUR, CHF, GBP and JPY) by means of state-space model confirmed negative correlation between these variables. <b>Subsequently</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> a concept of neutrality and superneutrality of money in the light of GDP dynamics during monitored period and practical aspects of monetary policy. In spite of some recent empirical findings, we express our belief in the long-run neutrality and superneutrality of money and in relative non-activistic monetary policy with price stability as its primary goal. inflation, money, interest rate, developing countries, long-run trends, developed countries, neutrality of money, state-space model...|$|E
40|$|Peer {{support is}} gaining {{increasing}} interest of professional public abroad {{and at home}} in recent years. Peer support consists in the active participation of people with personal experience with mental illness to mental health care system. This thesis presents this model {{as one of the}} forms of participation of people with mental illness in the services provided to them. Using a concrete example of an organization it describes the experience of its implementation in practice. The theoretical part shows how peer support is related to the transformation of attitudes of the society {{in which there is a}} remarkable shift to the recognition and enforcement of fundamental human rights and freedoms of people with mental illness. The practical part focus on a specific organization providing social services to people with mental illness. A new position of peer specialist has been introduced into practice the organization in recent years.

40|$|Nonlinear {{properties}} of magnetic flux {{feedback control system}} have been investigated mainly in this paper. We analyzed the influence of magnetic flux feedback control system on control property by time delay and interfering signal of acceleration. First of all, we have established maglev nonlinear model based on magnetic flux feedback and then discussed hopf bifurcation’s condition caused by the acceleration’s time delay. The critical value of delayed time is obtained. It is proved that the period solution exists in maglev control system and the stable condition has been got. We obtained the characteristic values by employing center manifold reduction theory and normal form method, which represent separately the direction of hopf bifurcation, {{the stability of the}} period solution, and the period of the period motion. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the influence maglev system on stability of by acceleration’s interfering signal and obtained the stable domain of interfering signal. Some experiments have been done on CMS 04 maglev vehicle of National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in Tangshan city. The results of experiments demonstrate that viewpoints of this paper are correct and scientific. When time lag reaches the critical value, maglev system will produce a supercritical hopf bifurcation which may cause unstable period motion...|$|E
40|$|Awake {{surgery is}} a {{surgical}} procedure applied {{to people with}} brain tumors. Patients are kept awake during surgery to perform language tasks during electrical stimulation of cortico-subcortical brain structures. When the application of electrical pulses to the brain repeatedly triggers errors, this is taken as {{an indication that the}} area is critically involved in the language skills probed by the task, and therefore should not be removed, as this would result in postoperative language deficits. In this thesis, we focused on the role of production tasks using finite verbs and the evaluation of their ability to assess language processing in comparison with the current gold standard (i. e., object naming). As a preliminary step in the development of novel, controlled object and verb production tasks, we critically reviewed the literature. We discussed published studies that proposed intraoperative tasks requiring the production of verbs in isolation and in sentences, and we graphically represented the stimulation sites and error types that were reported in each study. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each from a cognitive neuroscience and neurolinguistic perspective. With this information in mind, we constructed and validated two naming tasks for native speakers of Italian undergoing awake surgery – an object naming task and a finite verb production task. We administered the finite verb production task and other picture naming tasks to subjects with post-stroke aphasia, and established that a task that uses finite verbs shows a strong correlation with communicative abilities in daily life. Also, we introduced and compared our standardized finite verb task in the operating theater and compared it with an object naming task. Our tests are currently and successfully used in different surgery wards in Italy and overseas. This work can be extended to other neurological populations such as stroke, dementias, and epilepsy. ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} focused on {{vegetation}} traits and soil properties in grassland, few of which concerned about effects of human utilization patterns on grassland yet. Thus, this study hypothesized that human disturbance (e. g., grazing, mowing and fencing) triggered significant variation of biomass partitioning and carbon reallocation. Besides, there existed some differences of species diversity and soil fertility. To address these hypotheses of grassland with diverse utilization patterns in Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia, China, we sampled in situ about aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) to evaluate their biomass allocation. Species diversity and soil properties were also investigated. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the relationship of species diversity with environmental conditions, using data collected from 23 sites during the ecological project period of Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands (RGLG) program. The results were as follows: 1) both AGB and BGB were lower on grazing regime than those on fencing and mowing, but the ratio of root-to-shoot (R/S) was higher on grazing regime than the other two utilization patterns; 2) neither of evenness and Simpson Index was different significantly among all grassland utilization patterns in desert, typical, and meadow grassland at 0. 05. In meadow grassland, species richness of fencing pattern was significantly higher than that of grazing pattern (p < 0. 05); 3) both of soil organic carbon content and soil available phosphorous content were increased significantly on fencing pattern than grazing pattern (p < 0. 05) in desert grassland, and mowing patterns increased the soil nutrients (soil organic carbon, soil total phosphorous, soil available phosphorous, and soil total nitrogen) significantly compared with grazing patterns (p < 0. 05) in typical grassland. However, {{there were no significant differences}} among utilization patterns in meadow grassland. In conclusion, both of AGB and BGB were increased significantly by fencing. Moreover, species diversity and soil nutrients can be promoted via mowing and fencing. This study suggested that implementation of Ecological Project played a positive role in sustainable grassland utilization of Hulun Buir City and a strong positive influence on the entire temperate grassland...|$|E

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} how social relationships are processed and understood, mostly through examining {{the role of}} physical warmth. An intuitive example {{of the role of}} temperature in social relationships are descriptions like ‘being a cold fish’. Such metaphors have been shown to have to be taken literal; for example, warm conditions induce prosociality (Williams & Bargh, 2008). Here we go beyond such findings on metaphor. Central to theories on metaphor is that the effect of the experience on the abstract concept is unidirectional. An often researched relationship is that between time and space. One could think of an example that stresses the space->time relationship: finishing one’s dissertation sometimes appears to be far away. The reverse is more difficult to conceptualize; in fact, research has shown an asymmetry between the two concepts: concepts of space affect how one thinks about time, but not vice versa (Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008). We proposed that this asymmetry is less relevant for social relations; physical and social distance between self and other should affect perceptions of temperature in a similar way that physical temperature affects the way people perceive and think in social contexts. Theories describing social relations and development (e. g. attachment theory; Bowlby, 1969) stressed that people possess innate building blocks to engage in social interactions. At a very early stage in life, people need to know who is warm and trustworthy versus cold and hostile. In other words, babies first rely on perceptual input as opposed to more abstract, semantic representations. Physical warmth thus becomes an important proxy for social relations. To support this reasoning, we first showed that physically warm (as compared to cold) conditions induce greater psychological closeness with the experimenter, a greater perceptual focus on relations, and a greater usage of verbs. We then detailed how physically or socially inducing closeness or distance induces perceptions of higher or lower ambient temperature. <b>Subsequently,</b> <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the role of culture in relation to the body. From anthropology comes the suggestion that people develop techniques of the body (Mauss, 1979), acquired throughout life. Without truly paying attention to a concept (like honor) or posture (upright or slouched) one can form an association; upright postures might become associated with the idea that familism, male potency, and female purity are paramount. Cultures that oppose honor values actually might inhibit such concepts in such postures. Finally, our closing chapter addressed an existing dataset from cultural psychology with the knowledge acquired in this dissertation. In two previous articles, Kashima and Kashima (1998, 2003) addressed the effect of language and temperature on cultural values. They argued that temperature moderates the relationship between language and temperature. Based on the knowledge acquired in Chapter 2, we suggested that rather than moderating, temperature is an important factor as it affects the way people use language, which subsequently affects the way people construe cultural syndromes. The dissertation grounds social relations, and in its entirety supports that ‘body, psyche, and culture make each other up...|$|E
