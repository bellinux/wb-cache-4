Pinball games {{have become increasingly}} complex and multiple play modes, multi-level playfields, and even progression through a rudimentary [...] "plot" [...] have become common features on recent games. Pinball scoring objectives can be quite complex and require a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> to be hit in a particular order. Recent pinball games are distinguished by increasingly complex rule sets that require a measure of strategy and planning by the player for maximum scoring.

She was also part of a six-person tie for the final three slots, but lost in the tie-breaking procedure by comparing the shooters' last <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets.</b> Her score of 97 shots on the final attempt was the lowest among the six shooters in the tie.|$|E

50|$|All {{stations}} in the IBSS adopt a common value, aBeaconPeriod, that defines the length of beacon intervals or periods.

50|$|When Bugs is {{introduced}} along with Bruno, Bruno can't help but smack Bugs around a little. Bruno {{tries to get}} the better of Bugs - either by placing an anvil on top of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> so Bugs can hit his head, or by not catching Bugs during a trapeze act. However, Bugs soon starts getting the better of Bruno, which includes turning the tables on the bear by letting him fall from the trapeze into the band section (twice).|$|E
50|$|In Target Mode players {{must take}} off and {{navigate}} through a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in the shortest amount of time as possible {{and return to the}} runway for landing. Sky Canvas Mode requires players to Skywrite different words and symbols before the smoke can be blown away by the wind. There is also a training mode and a Free Flight mode. Training mode introduces players to the controls of the game while Free Flight mode lets players freely fly their unlocked aircraft without the restrictions or dangers found in {{the main part of the}} game.|$|E
5000|$|Throwing Stars: This boss is a ninja {{cat that}} has a machine that throws ninja stars. It will shoot at three {{different}} locations and try to hit you. There is a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> that might help the boss hit you. Unfortunately for the boss, he left the buttons that rotate the targets out there too. The game is won by angling the targets so that they hit a glass case covering the yellow button. By switching the red and yellow buttons, you will make it {{so that when the}} stars are shot at the top position, they will hit the cat.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, the U.S. Army Air Corps {{drew up a}} {{requirement}} for a radio-controlled target drone for training anti-aircraft artillery gunners.

50|$|The {{objective}} in these stages is also {{different from the}} standard side-view stages. Rather than moving into a linear path {{towards the end of}} the stage to face a stage boss, the player must first destroy a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> situated at fixed locations. The player may select their landing point at the start of the stage, while on-screen arrows help the player lead their character to the nearest target (a map can also be used that pinpoints the player's current location while showing the remaining targets). After all targets are destroyed, the player is transported to a new area to face the boss.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{military}} {{acquired a}} number of other drones similar in many ways to the Radioplane drones. The Globe company built a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets,</b> beginning with the piston-powered KDG Snipe of 1946, which evolved through the KD2G and KD5G pulsejet-powered targets and the KD3G and KD4G piston-powered targets, to the KD6G series of piston-powered targets. The KD6G series appears to have been {{the only one of the}} Globe targets to be built in substantial numbers. It was similar in size and configuration to the BTT series, but had a twin-fin tail. It was redesignated [...] "MQM-40" [...] in the early 1960s, by which time it was generally out of service.|$|E

50|$|Jamming a conical scanner is also {{relatively}} easy. The jammer {{simply has}} {{to send out}} signals on the radar's frequency with enough strength to make it {{think that was the}} strongest return. In this case a series of random short bursts of signal will appear to be a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in different locations within the beam. Jamming of this sort can be made more effective by timing the signals to be the same as the rotational speed of the feed, but broadcast at a slight delay, which results in a second strong peak within the beam, with nothing to distinguish the two. Jammers of this sort were deployed quite early, the British used them during World War II against the German conical-scanning Würzburg radar.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic sights are favored {{for obvious}} reasons - it is {{impossible}} to see the kill zone of the furthest targets clearly with the naked eye. Another advantage of high-magnification scopes is their ability to act as a simple range-finding tool. At very high magnifications, most scopes have a very shallow depth of field, and one can accurately focus on a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> at known distances and mark the scope for future reference. In competition you simply focus on the target and deduce the distance from the marks you made on the scope’s focus control.Some scopes use a side-wheel parallax adjustment to control focus (rather than a camera-like focus ring on the objective bell of the scope), and this allows the use of large diameter wheels to increase the distance between range markings and effectively improve ranging resolution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{handheld}} {{versions of}} the game are played as a 2.5D side-scrolling beat 'em up game, where players can freely choose to play as either Obi-Wan or Anakin, traversing across roughly a dozen levels to battle a variety of enemies and occasionally dodge deadly hazards, such as a laser trap or a missile launcher. Both characters have nearly identical attack moves, and can gain access to special unlockable moves that can be unleashed when a [...] "fury" [...] or [...] "focus" [...] gauge is filled up during battle. A few levels involve boss battles against characters with melee weapons, who usually can only be damaged after the player successfully blocks an attack, and some other levels end with a miniboss fight against a vehicle or elite enemy. The Nintendo DS version also exclusively adds extra 3D space battle levels that require the player to shoot down a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> or enemies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a computer program}} for synthesizing fundamental frequency (F 0) contours for English, and sketches the theory which underlies it. The F 0 contour {{is described as a}} <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> within an envelope specifying F 0 range; the F 0 contour between targets is computed by transition rules. The use of nonmonotonic transitions permits a sparser specification of the contour than has been possible in most previous frameworks. The program generates a good synthesis of neutral declarative intonation. Unlike most previous F 0 synthesis programs, it {{can also be used to}} synthesize a variety of non‐neutral intonation patterns...|$|E
