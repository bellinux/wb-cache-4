5|$|Many {{prominent}} scientists {{argued that}} the system was futile. Hans Bethe, along with IBM physicist Richard Garwin and Cornell University colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in Scientific American which analyzed the system and concluded that any putative enemy could disable such a system {{by the use of}} suitable decoys that would cost a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the SDI program.|$|E

5|$|Thomson's {{plum pudding}} model was disproved in 1909 {{by one of}} his former students, Ernest Rutherford, who {{discovered}} that most of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004. Many of these players are of South Asian origin, a demographic which comprises only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the overall population of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the {{contaminated}} spray was thrown {{back into the}} air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|Ancestry {{information}} {{reported in}} the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no single country accounting {{for more than a}} <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the population. Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as being of West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front {{government}} went to {{the country}} in a general election with Van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.|$|E

5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

The town features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports center with a swimming pool, library, culture center, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly. Only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dormitory town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly.|$|E
5|$|Only a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> {{the diamond}} ore {{consists}} of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds {{are located in}} the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury {{to a greater extent}} than NAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{average cost}} of {{crystalline}} boron is $5/g. Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} Ar {{adsorption}} experiments on a terrestrial labradorite and lunar rock 15415 crushed in vacuo are reported. The experiments {{were designed to}} test lunar atmosphere simulation models for the behavior of Ar on the lunar surface, as determined from the Apollo 17 mass spectrometer results. These models (Hodges, 1980, 1982) used a single adsorption potential to characterize the surfaces of lunar soil grains, {{with the result that}} high (6 - 7 kcal/mol) heats of adsorption were inferred. The present experimental results show that very high adsorption potentials are indeed associated with fresh mineral surfaces, but that these energetic surfaces occupy only <b>small</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> the total surface area. Nonetheless, these <b>small</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> surface, if they can be maintained in the lunar regolith in steady-state condition, could be sufficient to account for the Apollo 17 mass spectrometer observations...|$|R

The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> a second. The second {{problem was that the}} planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> heavier elements.
