25|$|In the 1890s, gypsum {{manufacturers}} perfected {{a method}} of strengthening plaster by adding a retarder, which controlled the <b>setting</b> <b>time,</b> thus creating a viable competitor to traditional lime plaster. Because gypsum was plentiful, and available at a relatively low price, and because the manufacturing process was so simple, new firms flooded and fragmented the market, placing constant downward pressure on prices.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the long}} curing time {{of at least}} a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster <b>setting</b> <b>time.</b> Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E
25|$|Dental amalgam {{has had a}} {{long history}} and global impact. It was first {{introduced}} in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker <b>setting</b> <b>time.</b> In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.|$|E
40|$|The {{interior}} shrinkage deformation {{and temperature}} change of high-strength concrete (HSC) at very early age, i. e., the first 24 h from casting, {{and up to}} an age of 72 h was investigated experimentally using optic fibre sensors (SOFO) and thermally sensitive resistors. The initial and the final <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> of HSC were also investigated. Results show that two turning points (I and II) on the development curve of deformation, both represent the onsets of the variation of rigidity in fresh HSC, can be recognized as the initial and the final <b>setting</b> <b>times,</b> which are evaluated around 4. 5 h to 5. 7 h and 9. 0 h to 11. 8 h, respectively. Also, the higher the fly-ash or silica fume replacement ratio, the longer the <b>setting</b> <b>times.</b> The <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> of HSC evaluated from the curve of temperature development are quite close to those measured from the deformation curve. In addition, the HSC <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> determined by penetration resistance method (ASTM C 403) demonstrate unusually large values. This method is therefore not advised {{to be used to}} measure the <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> of HSC...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{anesthetic}} {{management for}} pediatric patients undergoing direct laryngoscopy and/or bronchoscopy (DLB) is administered {{based on the}} anesthesiologist’s preference. Objectives: The preliminary analysis of this study aims to identify variables that decrease surgical end-to-transport (<b>SET)</b> <b>time</b> and directly impacts patient outcomes. <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> {{is defined as the}} time of surgery end to the time of patient exit from the operating room. METHODS: After IRB approval, all DLBs performed at Boston Children’s Hospital (Boston, MA) by the Otolaryngology Department from June 2012 to December 2014 (n= 2419) were obtained from the Anesthesia Information Management System. With a 0. 05 level of significance, a multivariate logistic regression was performed in SAS v 9. 3 with <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> as the dependent variable and surgery duration, age, gender, ASA status, airway device and extubation status as the independent variables. Airway device and extubation status were found to be moderately predictable of each other, so separate models were conducted. Spearman correlation testing was performed to evaluate the relationship between <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) duration. RESULTS: We excluded cases having ASA classification > 2, age > 21 years, regional nerve blocks, tracheostomy, nasal cannula, or unknown airway or extubation status. Remaining cases (n = 967) were arranged by <b>SET</b> <b>times</b> and dichotomized by the median value (14 minutes) into two groups (≤ 14 minutes and > 14 minutes). After adjusting for other variables, we found that patients with an endotracheal tube (ETT) were 4. 85 {{times more likely to have}} a <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> higher than the median, as compared with to those having with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) (p = 0. 0023, 95 % CI: 1. 76, 13. 33). We also found that patients with an ETT were 2. 89 times more likely to have a <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> higher than the median compared with those having a mask airway device. (p < 0. 0001, 95 % CI: 2. 09, 3. 98). In addition, there was a weak positive correlation between <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> and PACU duration (r = 0. 09406, p = 0. 0069). DISCUSSION: Preliminary analysis indicates that airway management has a significant impact on <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> after adjusting for surgery duration, age, gender, and ASA status. The use of either a mask or an LMA resulted in a lower <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> than the use of an ETT. The correlation of <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> and PACU duration suggests that reducing <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> does not negatively impact post-operative outcomes and may even be positively, though weakly, correlated. This study is limited by its retrospective nature. Future analysis will include the evaluation of commonly used perioperative anesthetics with dosage and timing variables and their correlation with <b>SET</b> <b>time</b> and patient outcomes...|$|R

2500|$|Plaster of Paris is a {{material}} {{that consists of}} calcium sulphate hemihydrate power and is produced by heating gypsum to 120°C. The chemical formula is as follows: :CaSO4·2H2O + Heat → CaSO4·½H2O [...] + [...] 1½ H2O (released as steam). When mixed with water, an exothermic reaction occurs and forms a hard white filling similar to density of fired ceramics.

2500|$|<b>Setting</b> <b>time</b> and [...] "early strength" [...] are {{important}} characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, [...] "natural" [...] cements, and [...] "artificial" [...] cements all rely upon their belite content for strength development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below , they contained no alite, {{which is responsible}} for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This was what we call today [...] "modern" [...] Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (e.g., Vicat and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at Northfleet, Kent was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were [...] "rule-of-thumb": Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln.|$|E
