Environmental pollution of heavy metals from automobiles has attained much {{attention in the}} recent past. The pollution of soil by heavy metals is a serious environmental issue. Heavy metals are released during different operations of the road transport such as combustion, component wear, fluid leakage and corrosion of metals lead, cadmium, copper and zinc which are the major metal pollutants of the road side environment. The present research is conducted to study heavy metal contamination in road side and industrial soil of Madurai city. The soil samples are collected from three sites and analyzed for six heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni and Cd). Their concentration and distribution in different depths (0 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm) were determined. Heavy metal contents were analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The studies with Enrichment Factor (EF) indicate that lead has been enriched to quite great extent while the Normalized <b>Scatter</b> <b>Coefficient</b> values (NSC) indicate faster enrichment of cadmium. The level of heavy metals in road side soils were higher as compared to their natural background levels. The results revealed that the heavy metals are harmful to the road side vegetation, wild life and the neighbouring human settlements. 789 - 796 | JRB | 2013 | Vol 3 | No 1 This article is governed by the Creative Commons Attribution Licens...|$|E

Cavities were drilled at the approximal surface and filled with light absorbing and light scattering fluids in different dye and particle concentrations to model successive stages of lesion progress. For light absorbing cavities the extinction as function of the decadic absorption coefficient measured at the occlusal surface could be approximated by the Lambert-Beer law (r = 0. 98 +/- 0. 01).

For example, comparison of the volatilities of Asian and European markets based on two estimated multivariate ARCH models is not so immediate. Like the variance matrix, the correlation matrix which provides a measure of intra-market dependence is also one of the key components in financial studies. Comparing several correlation matrices over time could help us to study market dynamics. The matrix of covariance or correlation is a k dimensional array of numbers, gathering all the informations about the individual variabilities and the pairwise correlations into one mathematical quantity. Therefore, this matrix is in some sense complete in measuring the variabilities and dependences, but the matrix itself is difficult to interpret in a concise and summarizing manner. We introduce a scalar measure of overall variabilities or dependences by collapsing all the elements in covariance matrix and correlation matrix into a single number. The determinant of covariance matrix, called the generalized variance, can be used as a measure of overall spread of the distribution. Similarly, the determinant |R | of correlation matrix, called the <b>scatter</b> <b>coefficient,</b> will be a measure of linear independence among the random variables while collective correlation 1 − |R | is a measure of overall dependence.

40|$|This {{research}} project investigated {{the use of}} image analysis to measure the air void parameters of concrete specimens produced under standard laboratory conditions. The results obtained from the image analysis technique were compared to results obtained from plastic air content tests, Danish air meter tests (also referred to as Air Void Analyzer tests), high-pressure air content tests on hardened concrete, and linear traverse tests (as per ASTM C- 457). Hardened concrete specimens were sent to three different laboratories for the linear traverse tests. The samples that were circulated to the three labs consisted of specimens that needed different levels of surface preparation. The first set consisted of approximately 18 specimens that had been sectioned from a 4 in. by 4 in. by 18 in. (10 cm by 10 cm by 46 cm) beam using a saw equipped with a diamond blade. These specimens were subjected to the normal sample preparation techniques that were commonly employed by the three different labs (each lab practiced slightly different specimen preparation techniques). The second set of samples consisted of eight specimens that had been ground and polished at a single laboratory. The companion labs were only supposed to retouch the sample surfaces if they exhibited major flaws. In general, the study indicated that the image analysis test results for entrained air content exhibited good to strong correlation to the average values determined via the linear traverse technique. Specimens ground and polished in a single laboratory and then circulated to the other participating laboratories for the air content determinations exhibited the strongest correlation between the image analysis and linear traverse techniques (coefficient of determination, r-squared = 0. 96, for n= 8). Specimens ground and polished {{at each of the}} individual laboratories exhibited considerably more <b>scatter</b> (<b>coefficient</b> of determination, r-squared = 0. 78, for n= 16). The image analysis technique tended to produce low estimates of the specific surface of the voids when compared to the results from the linear traverse method.

40|$|Losses of the {{reflected}} direct normal irradiance (DNI) between the heliostat field and receiver in a solar tower plant {{are caused by}} atmospheric scattering and absorption by aerosols and water vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer and can vary significantly with site and time. The radiation losses can be larger in desert environments compared to the standard and constant atmospheric conditions which are usually considered in ray-tracing or plant optimization tools. The main challenge for solar tower plant project development is the limited site-specific information about atmospheric extinction for many sites which are interesting for concentrated solar power (CSP) projects. Moreover, this information also affects the plant operation strategy because atmospheric extinction influences the power which is concentrated at the receiver aperture. Pitman and Vant-Hull (1982) presented a transmittance model (P&V model) which enables the calculation of radiation loss in a tower plant due to extinction, but relies on on-site measurements of the <b>scatter</b> <b>coefficient</b> which is usually not available. Four different approaches to determine atmospheric extinction and respectively atmospheric transmittance with commercially available instrumentation are presented and evaluated in this work. The first two approaches {{are based on a}} correction method (ABC method) which uses radiative transfer simulations to transform measurements performed with the FS 11 scatterometer of Vaisala and the LPV 4 transmissometer of Optec to the broadband transmittance which is needed for CSP. The ABC method reduces the mean deviation of the transmittance at Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) between the FS 11 and LPV 4. Therefore, it is recommended to apply the ABC method for atmospheric transmittance measurements instead of using only raw measurements of the FS 11 or LPV 4 for solar resource assessment. A comparison of the P&V model with the ABC corrected FS 11 and LPV 4 measurements is performed. The result confirms the limitations of the P&V model and emphasizes the necessity of a careful choice of the source of the scattering coefficient. Furthermore, an approach is presented which derives atmospheric broadband transmittance from particle number measurements of the EDM 164 particle counter of Grimm. The approach is mainly limited by the unknown inlet transmittance of the EDM 164 as well as necessary assumptions about aerosol specifications. Moreover, another approach to develop a transmittance model of Sengupta and Wagner (2011), is tested for PSA and enhanced. The advantage of this approach is that it only requires data of a common meteorological measurement station including DNI measurements which is available for CSP resource assessment anyway. Costs for additional instrumentation which is necessary for other approaches can therefore be avoided. Within its uncertainty limits, this approach seems promising and will be tested also at other sites. The transmittance height profile at PSA can be considered as homogeneous in the first 100 m above the surface according to two experiments performed at PSA. The horizontal derived transmittance at ground level can therefore be used representatively for the transmittance between the heliostats and the receiver at PSA. So far, only standard transmittance conditions with a temporal constant extinction coefficient are applied in plant yield calculations and field optimization tools. The annual plant yield for an exemplary solar tower plant at PSA is simulated in this work. The raytracing simulations show that overload dumping has to be considered in the discussion about the effect of atmospheric extinction in solar tower plants. Overload dumping takes place if some heliostats are defocused to avoid overload at the receiver or turbine. The annual plant yield of the exemplary solar tower plant is reduced by about 7. 04 % by atmospheric extinction at PSA and 1. 56 % if overload dumping due to the receiver and storage limitations is considered. The annual yield would be underestimated by about - 0. 38 % (- 0. 16 %) if a standard clear transmittance model equation would be applied instead of the variable transmittance time series and - 11. 18 % (- 3. 66 %) for a standard hazy model equation. To conclude, site- and time-dependent transmittance data sets should be considered by project developers during resource assessment, especially at arid sites where the annual plant yield can be reduced by several percent due to atmospheric extinction. At clear sites like PSA, standard assumptions might be accurate enough. To identify a clear site, the here presented extinction measurement systems based on DNI measurements can be applied. The system including FS 11 data can be recommended for a detailed examination of atmospheric extinction also at hazy sites. The modeling of site- and time-dependent extinction in ray-tracing tools is now possible. Further, an evaluation tool is available to rate the accuracy of solar tower plant simulations concerning atmospheric extinction and one exemplary plant is evaluated for PSA...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of {{ultrasound}} modulation of near infrared (NIR) light on the quantification of <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> in tissue-mimicking biological phantoms. Methods: A unique method to estimate the phase of the modulated NIR light making use of only time averaged intensity measurements using a charge coupled device camera is used in this investigation. These experimental measurements from tissue-mimicking biological phantoms are used to estimate the differential pathlength, in turn leading to estimation of optical <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A Monte-Carlo model base numerical estimation of phase in lieu of ultrasound modulation is performed to verify the experimental results. Results: The {{results indicate that the}} ultrasound modulation of NIR light enhances the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The observed effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> enhancement in tissue-mimicking viscoelastic phantoms increases with increasing ultrasound drive voltage. The same trend is noticed as the ultrasound modulation frequency approaches the natural vibration frequency of the phantom material. The contrast enhancement is less for the stiffer (larger storage modulus) tissue, mimicking tumor necrotic core, compared to the normal tissue. Conclusions: The ultrasound modulation of the insonified region leads to an increase in the effective number of scattering events experienced by NIR light, increasing the measured phase, causing the enhancement in the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The ultrasound modulation of NIR light could provide better estimation of <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The observed local enhancement of the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient,</b> in the ultrasound focal region, is validated using both experimental measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations.

40|$|Measurements of the aerosol light <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> (σsp) at a {{wavelength}} of λ - 550 nm were conducted at a coastal atmospheric research {{station in the}} east Atlantic Ocean during June 1999. Size distribution measurements between diameters of 3 nm and 40 um (at ambient humidity) were used to derive <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> from Mie theory. The calculated <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> were about a factor of 7. 4 higher than the measured <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The discrepancy was explained by a reduced cutoff of the sampling system at particle diameters between 6 and 8 μm, dependent on wind speed. The calculated aerosol scattering was about 1 order of magnitude higher than previously reported measurements in the MBL and is attributed to supermicrometer particles at sizes d > 10 μm dominating aerosol scattering.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study by the}} author showed that varying the geometric detail level across a normal range for room acoustic computer modeling has {{little effect on the}} results of those computer simulations, if major surfaces in the hall are still constructed accurately. <b>Scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> were kept constant across all detail levels. If one were using lower levels of detail, though, one might assign different material <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> to compensate for the less mixing geometry. To study the interaction between model detail level and <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> selection, three performance spaces in Omaha, Nebraska have been modeled in ODEON at varying levels of detail. The lowest level studied represents the spaces simply as six-sided boxes. Each level of detail is tested with five scenarios of <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Of all the objective parameters studied, reverberation time is confirmed to be the mos...|$|R
