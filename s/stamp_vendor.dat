50|$|The School-of-arts had a post-office {{built on}} the North-East corner in a room {{currently}} occupied as a Shire Branch (public) Library. The Post Office had previously been located in a building at the far Eastern end of Victoria Street where the road turns into Tablelands (Kingsgate) Road. Postal services are now handled by courier from Glen Innes, although the Red Range Store was licensed as a <b>Stamp</b> <b>Vendor.</b>|$|E

Behind the Théâtre Marigny, (formerly the Bouffes Parisiens, that Jacques Offenbach conducted in 1855 before leaving for a larger venue), and along the Avenue Gabriel, between the Avenue Matignon and the Avenue de Marigny, are the licensed <b>stamp</b> <b>vendors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Teams were {{instructed}} to travel to Tohotohobato Ambondrona Analakely, where they encountered the Roadblock, which asked [...] "Who can cut through the red tape?" [...] One team member had to go up steep staircases and find four different rubber <b>stamp</b> <b>vendors</b> with matching <b>stamps</b> to their clue (a boat, train, airplane, and car). When they had collected all four impressions, they would proceed to the Pit Stop at Cathedral Andohalo where their teammates were waiting.|$|R
2500|$|There is also {{an ongoing}} {{effort on the part}} of Beirut {{veterans}} and family members to convince the U.S. Postal Service and Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to create a stamp in memory of the victims of the attack, but the recommendation has not yet been approved. In the meantime, Beirut veterans have created a [...] "PC Postage" [...] commercially produced Beirut Memorial statue private <b>vendor</b> <b>stamp</b> (with or without the words [...] "They Came in Peace") that is approved for use as postage by the U.S. Postal Service.|$|R

40|$|In certain {{circumstances}} {{it is desirable}} to retain the file datetime stamp when moving or copying a file from one location to another. This is a trivial manner when performing such functions under one operating system because the COPY and/or MOVE commands typically do not alter the datetime stamp. But what about moving or copying files between different operating systems? The standard file transfer protocol (FTP) does not give an option to preserve datetime <b>stamps,</b> but many <b>vendors</b> have created FTP software with this feature. This short paper will describe how to achieve this outcome with SAS code. The code transfers files between the OpenVMS operating system and Windows using SAS/CONNECT. Windows API functions are then called to set a file’s datetime stamp to match with VMS. This code was used {{as part of a}} platform migration project. With slight modifications, the code should work equally well for Unix-to-Windows file transfers...|$|R
