40|$|We {{show that}} there exist {{dynamical}} phase transitions (DPTs), as defined in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 135704 (2013) ], in the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) away from the static quantum critical points. We study a class of <b>special</b> <b>states</b> associated with singularities in the generating functions of time-integrated observables found in [Phys. Rev. B 88 184303 (2013) ]. Studying the dynamics of these <b>special</b> <b>states</b> under {{the evolution of the}} TFIM Hamiltonian, we find temporal non-analtyicities in the initial-state return probability associated with dynamical phase transitions. By calculating the Berry phase and Chern number we show the set of <b>special</b> <b>states</b> have interesting geometric features similar to those associated with static quantum critical points.
