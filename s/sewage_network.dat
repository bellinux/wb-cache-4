40|$|In {{this study}} a real case {{is used in}} order to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} factors controlling the residential water demand in one of the suburb of the state of Kuwait. The important of this study {{comes from the fact that}} our case study has at the same time two kinds of residential areas in which one of them contains complete and modern water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks,</b> while the other is lacking this surface. Therefore an evaluation of the effect of the availability of water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> on residential water demand is made by making a comparison studies between two different residential areas. These two residential areas have the same controlling factors for water demands, such as economical conditions, climatical conditions, standard of living, and social life. The method presented is based on a sensitivity analysis of the effect of the availability of water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> on the per capita daily water demand compared to water demand at the other part of our residential area with no water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks.</b> The analysis of data from both residential areas showed a greater water demands for all houses that located at the part of no availability of water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> which is in contrast with assumption that the demand for water will increase with water and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

The main cause of degradation is the corrosion of concrete due to the in-situ production of sulfuric acid by bacteria.

The Baiana Water and Sanitation Company (Embasa) does not treat the <b>sewage</b> <b>network,</b> and the city has long been channeling the galleries to the Do Antônio River.

The Brumadian population at that time had the water supply compromised in its totality, being supplied by tank truck. Before the construction of the Cristalândia dam, the city was supplied by the old dam of the Do Antônio River, Which was analyzed belatedly and the water declared as unfit for human consumption, because it contains excess of minerals of various types.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{resource}} saving is particularly relevant for household waste removal systems and <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> in modern residential houses. Some {{options for the}} shared use of <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> and natural organic waste removal systems in residential buildings are assessed by the author. Layouts, operation patterns and elements of the systems are provided. Strengths of shared operation of the systems and networks are analyzed with account for the present-day requirements applicable to the systems in question. The positive factor is that residents {{do not need to}} spend money for expensive food waste disposers for their homes. They will also use garbage chutes in their houses. Joint operation of food waste removal systems and domestic <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> will reduce the load on landfills which has been increasing in the recent years. It will increase the load on urban <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> and water treatment facilities, but it will not be a critical factor, because treatment facilities are capable of purifying water without much difficulty. Processed food waste may be applied to produce fertilizers and biogas to be used as fuel. Therefore, benefits of the limited use of landfills are obvious. Waste shredding is the most convenient, efficient and nature friendly way of processing the organic waste at the initial stage of its generation. It prevents rotting typical for the organic waste if disposed together with the municipal solid waste. The experience of the United States, where food waste is treated by in-sink food erators and removed into the sewage system is less expensive for city budgets than their disposal at landfills. Food wastes consist mainly of the water (70 %); therefore, water treatment facilities assure a more natural way of processing this type of waste than waste collection and disposal. Separation of organic waste from solid waste also reduces the number of disease vectors such as flies, rodents, and cockroaches.

In this study we investigated the travel time and dispersion of pollutants by means of tracer experiments in <b>sewage</b> <b>networks</b> and a creek. The travel time of surface tracers {{has been found to}} be significantly shorter than that of a bulk flow tracer. The ratio of the travel times of a bulk flow tracer and surface tracers agreed with the known correlations obtained for rivers. An increasing tendency in the ratio of travel times has been observed for increasing bulk flow velocity. A segment-wise dispersion model was implemented in the existing hydraulic model of a sewer system. The simulation results were compared with the experimental observations. The dispersion rate of the bulk flow tracer has been found to obey Taylor’s mixing theory for long channels and was more intensive than that of surface tracers in community sewage channels...|$|R
