5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses.

5|$|Alberti {{requested}} in {{his will}} to avoid pageantry or complex funerals, and inherited his properties (house, farm, furniture, slaves, clothing, books, etc.) to his siblings Juana María, Matilde, Casimira and Manuel Silvestre. His personal diaries are kept, but with some parts of them being lost due to poor keeping. <b>Still,</b> <b>his</b> personal bibliography is used by historians to reconstruct his influences and ideological background. It included many works of theology, studies of the Bible, scholastic theologists and juridical studies. Alberti's remains were lost when the chapel was demolished {{to make way for}} an expansion of 9 de Julio Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf {{was awarded}} a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. <b>Still,</b> <b>his</b> {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to U.S. foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the assumed name of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E

5|$|More {{sympathetic}} authors {{point out}} complex situations that Rommel had to face. Brian Hanley, from USNI's Editorial Board of Directors, comments that Rommel was beaten {{the moment he}} arrived in Africa, considering the Allied troops outnumbered the Afrika Korps and they worked under a much more straightforward chain of command, while orders sent from Berlin to North Africa were rarely kept confidential. Hanley sees Rommel turning German and Italian military authorities against each other as turning liabilities into advantages and that he repeatedly created operational miracles that made a strategic investment in the Africa theatre attractive in 1942. Also, according to Hanley, if Rommel stood <b>still,</b> <b>his</b> enemy's strength would accumulate while his own, depending on an uncertain supply line, would diminish, thus he needed the British stocks of supply {{to deal with his}} logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were <b>still</b> <b>his</b> wife.|$|E
5|$|When Henry V died in 1422, Northumberland was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} council appointed to govern during the minority of Henry VI. He might {{have been involved in}} an embassy to the Council of Siena in 1423, but <b>still</b> <b>his</b> main area of responsibility lay in the border region. In the council, he seems to have belonged to the circle around Bishop Henry Beaufort, and he followed Beaufortnow cardinalto peace negotiations at Berwick in 1429. As Warden of the East March, he was constantly occupied with peace negotiations and defence of northern England, but his efforts were constantly frustrated, and in 1434 he resigned his commission. The next year, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, equally exasperated by the lack of royal support, gave up his commission as Warden of the West March. Northumberland {{was appointed}} joint warden with the earl of Huntingdon of both marches for one year, during which time, although suffering defeat by the Earl of Angus at the Battle of Piperdean, he was able to repel a siege on Roxburgh by James I of Scotland. In 1440 he was once more appointed Warden of the West March, and this time held the position until his death.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden tried to keep Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford Meek, Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones Meek had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together an outfit at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found out his own men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were <b>still</b> <b>his</b> men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage had been done to their relationship.|$|E

The project was then delayed when Otto ran out of money; he returned to the West Indies to secure more funds, then came back to Brighton and supervised the completion of the crescent, which happened in 1807. Unlike many contemporary and later developments in Brighton, Otto was able to take his time to complete it because he was not wholly dependent on it for his financial success: his plantations were <b>still</b> <b>his</b> main source of income.|$|E
25|$|The black soldier became another stock type {{during the}} Civil War and merged {{qualities of the}} slave and the dandy. He was {{acknowledged}} for playing some role in the war, but he was more frequently lampooned for bumbling through his drills or for thinking his uniform made him the equal of his white counterparts. He was usually better at retreating than fighting, and, like the dandy, he preferred partying to serious pursuits. <b>Still,</b> <b>his</b> introduction allowed for some return to themes of {{the breakup of the}} plantation family.|$|E
