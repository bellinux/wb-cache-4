40|$|Abstract. The {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying cell {{attachment and}} subsequent cell <b>spreading</b> <b>on</b> laminin are {{shown to be}} distinct form one another. Cell spreading is dependent upon the binding of cell surface galactosyltransferase (GalTase) to laminin oligosaccharides, while initial cell attachment to laminin occurs independent of GalTase activity. Anti-GalTase IgG, {{as well as the}} GalTase modifier protein, a-lactalbumin, both block GalTase activity and inhibited B 16 -F 10 melanoma cell <b>spreading</b> <b>on</b> laminin, but not initial attachment. On the other hand, the addition of UDP galactose, which increases the catalytic turnover of GalTase, slightly increased cell spreading.

5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E

5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely to avoid a negative reaction from Abraham. After finding out about their relationship, Abraham fired Pérez from the group just weeks before the album was due to be released, and threatened to disband the group if Selena went after Pérez. Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her father would have never approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E

40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) {{continue}} to be controversial, with concern that trades in them drive prices of government debt down. Evidence from the CDS spread for one country—Ireland—indicates that its CDS spread has been reacting to news about developments in Ireland, Greece, and the European Union.

Concerns about the debt of some European countries are in the news again in September 2010.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E

He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, archaeological {{techniques}} such as field walking {{have led to the}} discovery of finds ranging in age from prehistoric flints and Bronze Age axe heads to Roman and late medieval finds. Featuring prominently amongst these finds were Roman artefacts including coins, brooches and a snake bracelet. At the invitation of local historian Jim Balme, Time Team excavated in Warburton in September 2006. They were searching for a Roman fortlet that previous archaeological digs by South Trafford Archaeological Group (STAG) indicated might be present. Though no evidence of a Roman fortlet was found, the discovery of strip lynchets indicates that there was a Romano-British farm in Warburton. The presence of Roman finds was explained as rubbish, mixed in with manure to be <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> the crops.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators {{of another}} Key game-turned-anime, Air, decided to animate a new {{adaptation}} of Kanon. This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007 at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention {{that they have}} officially licensed the second Kanon anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> the Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007. In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second Kanon anime were transferred from ADV to Funimation Entertainment who continued to produce the series in North America.|$|E

Superhydrophobic FEP-Teflon was prepared by ion etching followed by oxygen glow-discharge. Hydrophilic FEP-Teflon was prepared by ion etching only. Water contact angles of the modified surfaces were 140 - 150 -degrees and 5 - 10 -degrees for the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic variant, respectively. (Untreated FEP-Teflon: 109 -degrees). Spreading of human skin fibroblasts significantly increased on hydrophilic FEP-Teflon (257 -mu-m 2 per cell), whereas {{a significant decrease}} was observed on super-hydrophobic FEP-Teflon (158 -mu-m 2 per cell), as compared to untreated FEP-Teflon (209 -mu-m 2 per cell).

5|$|The Australian magpie {{is found}} in the Trans-Fly region of {{southern}} New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are <b>spread</b> <b>on</b> both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke's Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.|$|E
