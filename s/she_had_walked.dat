2500|$|The villains of {{the story}} are the Wicked Witch of the West and the Wicked Witch of the East. [...] The wicked witches use their power to control and enslave their subjects. [...] There was an equal balance between good and evil, and until this balance was altered, {{there could be no}} change or {{development}} in Oz. This standoff can be seen as an allusion between the different political parties in America. [...] The Wicked Witch of the West represents the American West, including the wealthy railroad, oil barons, and nature. The American West's greatest weapon in the 19th century, though, was nature, most malignantly the drought. [...] The effects lasted longer than any fire or twister, and a long enough drought could ruin a whole year's worth of crops. [...] Thus, water as the weapon to kill the Witch of the West is quite poetic. [...] The brown mass the witch's remains turn into resembles mud after a heavy storm. [...] Dorothy even cleans the melted witch off the floor and her shoes as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>walked</b> through a rainy puddle.|$|E
