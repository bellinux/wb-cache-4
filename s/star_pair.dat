2500|$|It {{had been}} International Navigation's plan to {{maintain}} Inman's {{status as a}} British flag carrier. [...] However, even before City of New York was completed, the British Government responded to Inman's ownership change by revoking the line's mail contract. International Navigation lobbied the US Congress to replace the subsidy and allow the Inman speedsters to register in the US despite the law that only permitted US-built ships to be registered there. [...] After considerable controversy, Congress enacted the subsidy provided that International Navigation build two similar ships in the US and all four twin-screw liners being available to {{the government in the}} event of a crisis. [...] In one of his last acts in office, on February 22, 1893, President Benjamin Harrison boarded the now renamed New York during a snowstorm and raised the American Flag. [...] The Inman Line was merged into International Navigation's American Line. [...] As a part of the change, the former Inman liners now used Southampton as their UK destination rather than Liverpool, ending their direct rivalry with the White <b>Star</b> <b>pair</b> until 1907 when Teutonic and Majestic were also transferred to Southampton.|$|E

40|$|Members of widely-separated stellar {{binaries}} (> 0. 1 pc) or loosely bound stellar {{associations and}} clusters {{are born with}} small spreads in kinematics and chemistry, but disrupt and dissociate on timescales comparable to their orbital time within the Milky Way. The kinematic properties of comoving <b>star</b> <b>pairs</b> [...] -bound wide binaries or unbound but coeval stars [...] -are therefore sensitive to both the smooth tidal field and gravitational perturbation spectrum of the Milky Way. In previous work, we identified > 4, 000 candidate comoving pairs using only astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalog and find {{a large number of}} pairs with separations > 1 pc. Without radial velocity measurements {{for the vast majority of}} these pairs, the false-positive rate at these separations is significant (~ 50 %). Here we present results from our own low-resolution radial-velocity survey of a random sample of the candidate pairs to identify and validate true comoving <b>star</b> <b>pairs.</b> Of the 311 observed comoving pairs, we confirm 127 comoving pairs with separations as large as ~ 10 pc, our original search limit. Between separations of 0. 001 pc to ~ 0. 5 pc, the number of confirmed pairs per separation decreases with increasing separation (number per log separation is uniform). From ~ 0. 5 pc to 10 pc, the number per separation is approximately uniform (number per log separation increases). We confirm the discovery of a population of comoving <b>star</b> <b>pairs</b> at very large separations, suggesting that disrupted wide binaries and stellar associations remain approximately spatially coherent.
