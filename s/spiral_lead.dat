40|$|The {{acoustic}} attenuation {{performance of a}} round silencer with the spiral duct at the inlet is investigated. A Finite Element Method was used for a three-dimensional numerical com-putations in a COMSOL Multiphysics application. A time-harmonic analysis without airflow was used for a frequency range from 10 Hz to 2 kHz. The {{results show that the}} spiral duct at the inlet can improve the {{acoustic attenuation}} performance of a round silencer. The sound attenuation depends on a <b>spiral</b> <b>lead,</b> an absorbing material and frequency. The transmission loss of investigated acoustic system with spiral ducts is related to an initial acoustic system with circular pipe. The results are shown as a growth of transmission loss ∆TL given by an insertion of the spiral ducts. A specific parameter given by relation of the <b>spiral</b> <b>lead</b> s to constant circular duct diameter d is presented as s/d ratio. The value of ∆TL is determined by s/d ratio and increases in specific frequencies. An acoustic wave, in those frequencies, is there divided at the outlet of the spiral duct and major acoustic energy goes aside, directly to an absorptive material, and minor acoustic energy goes axially to the silencers outlet. This is the damping effect of the spiral ducts...|$|E

Despite {{the lack of}} long-range translational and rotational order, {{there is a large}} PBG for the TE polarized light. Due to spatial inhomogeneity in the air hole spacing, the bandedge modes are spatially localized by Bragg scattering from the parastichies in the spiral structure. They have discrete angular momenta that originate from different families of the parastichies whose numbers correspond to the Fibonacci numbers. The unique structural characteristics of the golden-angle <b>spiral</b> <b>lead</b> to distinctive features of the bandedge modes that are absent in both photonic crystals and quasicrystals.

40|$|Abstract. The {{promise of}} {{modeling}} by subdivision {{is to have}} simple rules that avoid cumbersome stitching-together of pieces. However, already in one variable, exactly reproducing a variety of basic shapes, such as conics and <b>spirals,</b> <b>leads</b> to non-stationary rules that are no longer as simple; and combining these pieces within the same curve by one set of rules is challenging. Moreover, basis functions, that allow reading off smoothness and computing curvature, are typically not available. Mimicking subdivision of splines with non-uniform knots allows us to combine the basic shapes. And to analyze non-uniform subdivision in general, the literature proposes interpolating the sequence of subdivision control points by circles. This defines a notion of discrete curvature for interpolatory subdivision. However, we show that this discrete curvature generically yields misleading information for non-interpolatory subdivision and typically does not converge, not even for non-uniform spline subdivision. Analyzing the causes yields three general approaches for solving or at least mitigating the problem: equalizing parameterizations, sampling subsequences and a new skip-interpolating subdivision approach...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{remarkable}} {{progress in}} developing multifunctional materials, spin-driven ferroelectrics featuring both spontaneous magnetization and electric polarization are still rare. Among such ferromagnetic ferroelectrics are conical spin spiral magnets with a simultaneous reversal of magnetization and electric polarization {{that is still}} little understood. Such materials can feature various multiferroic domains that complicates their study. Here we study the multiferroic domains in ferromagnetic ferroelectric Mn$_{ 2 }$GeO$_{ 4 }$ using neutron diffraction, and show that it features a double-Q conical magnetic structure that, apart from trivial 180 degree commensurate magnetic domains, can be described by ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains only. We show unconventional magnetoelectric couplings such as the magnetic-field-driven reversal of ferroelectric polarization with no change of spin-helicity, and present a phenomenological theory that successfully explains the magnetoelectric coupling. Our measurements establish Mn$_{ 2 }$GeO$_{ 4 }$ as a conceptually simple multiferroic in which the magnetic-field-driven flop of conical spin <b>spirals</b> <b>leads</b> to the simultaneous reversal of magnetization and electric polarization.

The presence of a broad pure-magnetic half-order (1 / 2) Bragg reflection has been detected at zero external field. The joint fit of the reflectivity curves and Mossbauer spectra of reflectivity measured near the critical angle and at the "magnetic" peak reveals that the magnetic structure of the multilayer is formed by two spirals, one in the odd and another one in the even iron layers, with the opposite signs of rotation. The double-spiral structure starts from the surface with the almost antiferromagnetic alignment of the adjacent Fe layers. The rotation of the two <b>spirals</b> <b>leads</b> to nearly ferromagnetic alignment of the two magnetic subsystems at some depth, where the sudden turn of the magnetic vectors by ~ 180 deg (spin-flop) appears, and both spirals start to rotate in opposite directions.
