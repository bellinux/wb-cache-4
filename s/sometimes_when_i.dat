2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just {{took a couple of}} lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E
2500|$|Isis {{were the}} opening act for Tool's late 2006 North American tour {{in support of}} their new album, 10,000 Days. This led to {{increased}} exposure for the band; however, the band members are not particularly comfortable with fame, and tend to keep their affairs private. Turner has stated that [...] "We never imagined that Isis would become as successful or as popular as it has", and confesses: [...] " [...] taking a deeply personal interest in who I am, it fucking freaks me out. And I really do feel like <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get approached, I'm retreating into my shell." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{play guitar}} {{in such an}} unorthodox way," [...] he told Guitar World in 1996. [...] "I've never taken a guitar lesson. One of our assistants brought it to my {{attention}} {{a few months ago}} that, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> play chords, my thumb is on the fretted side of the neck. I have no idea why or how I do it, but I do." [...] "I remember a time early on when Ace and I would play," [...] added Paul Stanley, [...] "and I would do vibrato with my hand, and Ace would get vibrato by shaking his whole arm against the neck of the guitar [...]" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{wait till}} I get {{two or three}} things. This is my lodging. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> late <b>I</b> sleep at the hotel where I am engaged, so nobody will think {{anything}} of my staying out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} furious <b>sometimes,</b> Luka, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read books {{of what is}} called sport, and find men boasting of killing {{numerous}} creatures merely for the pleasure of killing them. I feel that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to flog such brutes." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read spiritual treatises {{in which}} {{perfection}} is shown {{with a thousand}} obstacles, surrounded by a crowd of illusions, my poor little mind quickly tires. I close the learned book which is breaking my head and drying up my heart, and I take up Holy Scripture. Then all seems luminous to me; a single word uncovers for my soul infinite horizons; perfection seems simple; I {{see that it is}} enough to recognize one's nothingness and to abandon oneself, like a child, into God's arms. [...] Leaving to great souls, to great minds, the beautiful books I cannot understand, I rejoice to be little because only children, and those who are like them, will be admitted to the heavenly banquet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hear myself on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about {{trying to pick up}} the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you know, Christie," [...] {{said her}} father, [...] "I <b>sometimes</b> fancy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hear that new parson fellow {{talk about his}} artistic feelings, and so on, that he's just a trifle selfish, or at least self-centred. He always dwells so much on his own {{enjoyment}} of things, you know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get blue--as I am to-day--I think I'll go. But, in sober truth, Nell, it's {{not likely}} that I'll spend all my life here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your shoe can't pinch {{you very}} bad, I should think. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{think of you}} it seems that you are an {{embodiment}} of prosperity and happiness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm <b>sometimes</b> happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{think that}} I shan't {{live to see}} the long run," [...] said the baronet. This was {{the manner in which they}} tried to be merry that evening after dinner at Wharton Hall. The two girls sat {{listening}} to their seniors in contented silence,--listening or perhaps thinking of their own peculiar troubles, while Arthur Fletcher held some book in his hand which he strove to read with all his might.|$|R
6000|$|... "I used to cry <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{looked at}} myself in the glass as a child," [...] she confessed. [...] "My hands were the only thing that consoled me." ...|$|E

But she's gone now, and we depend on passing vessels. Sometimes we have had as high as six calls in one year. At other times, a year, and even longer, has gone by without one passing ship.

30|$|The {{manager of}} our {{publishing}} house uses his mobile phone to micromanage the book editing process. I frequently receive work-related text messages from him, <b>sometimes</b> even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am {{having dinner with}} my family. I feel extremely depressed because I no longer enjoy the independence and autonomy that I once had. The manager can reach me, whenever he chooses. What is worse, I am expected to keep my mobile phone on even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am off-duty or on vacation, {{so that he can}} assign me new jobs at any time.|$|R
6000|$|I landed {{silently and}} stole {{up to the}} tent {{to see if he}} were {{exploring}} under the fly, as he <b>sometimes</b> did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was away. A curious sound, a hollow tunk, tunk, tunk, tunk-a-tunk, grew louder as I approached. I stole to the big cedar, where I could see the fireplace and the little opening before my tent, and noticed first that I had left the cracker box open (it was almost empty) <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hurried away after the otter. The curious sound was inside, growing more eager every moment--tunk, tunk, tunk-a-trrrrrrr-runk, tunk, tunk! ...|$|R

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Sometimes</b> all <b>I</b> can Imagine are Hands There is {{a winter}} within me, a place so cold, so covered in snow, I rarely go there. But <b>sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> all <b>I</b> can imagine are hands, when {{trees in the}} forest look like they’re made of wood, then I know it’s time to take my {{photograph}} of Akhmatova and sling it in a bag with socks and scarves. My neighbours must think it strange to see me strapping on my snowshoes, to hear me roar at the huskies as I untangle the harness. But when all you can imagine are hands it’s best {{to give a little}} wave and move out into the whiteness. “Underpinning the lyrical narrative is a writing style as graceful as the author’s thought.” Poetry Ireland ReviewDays Like These (with Theo Dorgan & Paula Meehan) was published by Brooding Heron Press in Washington State; a fine art edition, editing and design by Sam and Sally Green.Limited edition of 300 copies.

60|$|We went on long sails together, towards Wood's Hole and {{the open}} sea, the sprays washing over us. Her cheeks grew tanned.... <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> praised her and spoke {{confidently}} of our future, she wore a troubled expression.|$|E

I have also at some times, even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have begun to speak the word with much clearness, evidence, and liberty of speech, yet been, before the ending of that opportunity, so blinded and so estranged from the things I have been speaking, and have been also so straightened in my speech, as to utterance before the people, that I have been as if I had not known, or remembered what I have been about; or as if my head {{had been in a}} bag all the time of my exercise.|$|R
