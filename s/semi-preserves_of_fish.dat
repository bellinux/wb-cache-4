The data collected showed that households can be grouped, into low, middle and high income groups and the analysis revealed that majority of the households in the study area fell within the low income group and this group spent a higher percentage of their income on fish. The study revealed that household size, educational status of household head, taste <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> income <b>of</b> household head had significant effects on the preference and consumption pattern <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in the study area. The result revealed that majority of the households (about 50 %) preferred frozen form <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and this was followed by fresh water fish while a few made smoked fish their choice. It was found out that factors which were significant to frozen <b>fish</b> include availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> household size, ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> freshness <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> while those significant to fresh water include educational status, level of household head, taste <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> cleanliness <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and factors significant to smoked <b>fish</b> include availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> household size and freshness <b>of</b> <b>fish...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fish {{are good}} {{indicators}} of long-term changes of fluvial ecosystems therefore, assessment <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages is frequently used in {{evaluation of the}} ecological status of surface waters, especially since {{the implementation of the}} EU Water Framework Directive.
