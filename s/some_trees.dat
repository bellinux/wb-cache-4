5|$|Trees usually {{reproduce}} using seeds. Flowers {{and fruit}} may be present, but <b>some</b> <b>trees,</b> such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns, produce spores instead.|$|E
5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. <b>Some</b> <b>trees</b> in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very spindly, and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E

5|$|The winds caused {{damage to}} <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> and {{structures}} {{and there was}} some minor flooding in the panhandle. There were two indirect fatalities from Katrina in Walton County {{as a result of a}} traffic accident. Along the Florida panhandle, 77,000 customers lost power. Damage along the panhandle was estimated at $100million.|$|E
5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} vegetation types and <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{across the}} state {{included}} a report of 47mph (76km/h) near the state's southeastern coastline. The winds downed <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> and resulted in power outages, and one person in Carrolwood was injured after a tree fell onto a house. The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state, some of which damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2,000people without power after it knocked down a power line. Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> placed it close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others placed it as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Nova Scotia, {{the winds}} from Carol were {{strong enough to}} knock down trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44inches (62mm) in the province, caused street {{flooding}} in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, and as far east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73inches (44mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed <b>some</b> <b>trees,</b> resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>trees</b> {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E

5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnant of}} Alberto {{produced}} strong winds across the Canadian Maritimes, including gusts of 74mph (119km/h) in the Barrington district of Nova Scotia. Sustained winds reached 51mph (83km/h). Rainfall {{from the storm}} was moderate, with some locations reporting 0.4inches (10mm) per hour; totals exceeded 2inches (50mm) in numerous areas. Due to wet grounds, the winds knocked down <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> and several tree limbs, and also downed some power lines, causing localized power outages. Moderate winds and rainfall affected Newfoundland, as well. According to a press report, the storm left four sailors missing about 230miles (370km) south of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{freshwater}} flooding {{occurred in}} Beauregard Parish, leaving homes in DeRidder flooded. High water across the southwestern {{portion of the}} state resulted in the closure of several roadways, including U.S. Route 171 and various state highways. Isolated wind damage was reported, particularly near the Texas border, with <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> and power lines blown down. A total of about 13,000power customers lost electricity in southwestern Louisiana. One F1 tornado briefly touched down in Vermilion Parish, blowing the roof off one home and downing trees and power lines. Damage throughout Louisiana was estimated at $525,000.|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>tree</b> species (e.g. Pistacia aethiopica, Pistacia atlantica) {{can exist}} as small bushes and shrubs {{due to the}} {{extremes}} of their habitat, adverse conditions, or the excessive consumption by wildlife or livestock that hinders growth.|$|R
50|$|Red locusts {{actively}} {{seek out}} moist environments such as seasonal floodplains. Grains are their primary food source, so grassy lowlands are prime habitat. They also like {{spending time in}} trees and thus prefer <b>some</b> <b>tree</b> cover.|$|R

5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two {{people who did not}} evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned safely to the boat. The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E

The route comes to an {{intersection}} with the eastern terminus of DE 8 as it leaves Little Creek and becomes Bayside Drive again. The road continues northwest through farmland with <b>some</b> <b>trees</b> and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of Chandelle Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north to intersect the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
