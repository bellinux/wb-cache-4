5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 1912, a {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} Richmond for the laying of {{the cornerstone of the}} Confederate Memorial Institute's Battle Abbey.

5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or hub brakes. This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress <b>on</b> each radial <b>spoke</b> to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> non-drive side and semi-tangential <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial <b>spoking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive side of the rear wheel.|$|R

On April 24, 1912, he first <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act.

5|$|On February 7, 2011, the premier’s office {{announced}} {{that due to}} several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were protecting her.

Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E

5|$|He later <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
