5|$|An ancient carved <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> slate {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to}} the blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), which used to be the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{precipitation}} in continuously casting <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> a Ti-Nb {{microalloyed steel}} was studied. The samples {{were taken from}} different places along cross section <b>of</b> <b>slabs</b> and the precipitations were observed by TEM. The {{results show that the}} centre area <b>of</b> <b>slab</b> contains more precipitates of Ti-Nb and carbonitrides more uniformly distribute in the centre along thickness direction. Moreover, the precipitates in the middle are more than those in the edge along width direction <b>of</b> <b>slab.</b> Some large carbonitrides exist in the middle <b>of</b> <b>slab</b> because the temperature in the middle is higher during slab cooling resulting in the large precipitates. The study provides the basis for understanding the precipitation in <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> Ti-Nb microalloyed steels...|$|R

5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It {{was made by the}} cabinet maker Frederic Labòria, who also collaborated with Gaudí on the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, David Martill et al. {{announced}} {{the preservation of}} soft tissue in a specimen referred to a cf. Scelidosaurus sp., that is, an unnamed species for which a comparison with Scelidosaurus can be illuminating. The fossil, with inventory number BRSMG CF2781, {{was in the early}} 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in the legacy of the late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved {{in such a way that}} an envelope of preserved soft tissue is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, a six-foot <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E
5|$|The Gangas built many Hindu temples with {{impressive}} Dravidian gopuras containing stucco {{figures from}} the Hindu pantheon, decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the mantapa (hall) along with saptamatrika carvings (seven heavenly mothers). Some well known examples are the Arakeshvara Temple at Hole Alur, Kapileswara temple at Manne, Kolaramma temple at Kolar, Rameshvara temple at Narasamangala, Nagareshvara temple at Begur and the Kallesvara temple at Aralaguppe. At Talakad they built the Maralesvara temple, the Arakesvara temple and the Patalesvara temple. Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common, Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes (<b>slab</b> <b>of</b> stone with decorative sculptures) illustrating episodes from the epics and puranas. Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of virgal (hero stones) they have left behind; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes, Hindu deities, saptamatrikas, Jain tirthankars and ritual death (such as the Doddahundi hero stone).|$|E
5|$|The central icon of Vimala is of {{sixth century}} CE. The present structure, {{based on its}} architecture, {{seems to have been}} built in the ninth century under the Eastern Ganga dynasty, {{possibly}} over ruins of an earlier temple. Its architecture is similar to the shrine of Narasimha near the Mukti-mandapa (a temple hall) in the Jagannath temple complex, dated to the ninth century. The Madala Panji states that the temple was constructed by Yayati Keshari, a ruler of Somavashi Dynasty of South Kosala. Kings Yayati I (c. 922–955) and Yayati II (c. 1025–1040) are known by the title Yayati Keshari. The sculptures, especially the parshvadevatas (attendant deities), as well as the background <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> the central icon, reflect the Somavashi style and may be part of the original temple, on whose ruins the new temple was constructed. Vimala is believed to have preceded even the central Jagannath shrine.|$|E

5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts {{and local officials}} to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E
