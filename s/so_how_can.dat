25|$|Kant {{ran into}} a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in {{producing}} objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as substance is that which endures through time, and the cause must always be prior to the effect.|$|E

[...] Issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> it be recognized; how consciousness relates to language; whether consciousness can be understood {{in a way that does}} not require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to be conscious, a topic studied in the field of artificial intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|Zuma's {{stance on}} Zimbabwe has been mixed. In a 2006 {{interview}} with the German magazine Der Spiegel, he expressed more sympathetic sentiments towards Mugabe, saying that [...] "Europeans often {{ignore the fact that}} Mugabe is very popular among Africans. In their eyes, he has given blacks their country back after centuries of colonialism." [...] He continued: [...] "The people love him, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> we condemn him? Many in Africa {{believe that there is a}} racist aspect to European and American criticism of Mugabe. Millions of blacks died in Angola, the Republic of Congo and Rwanda. A few whites lost their lives in Zimbabwe, unfortunately, and already the West is bent out of shape." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... In origin, no {{one likes}} the Jews except the Jews. Even they {{themselves}} rarely like each other.... The American people {{do not like the}} Jews nor do the Europeans, because the Jews by their very nature do not like anyone else. Rather they look at other people as wild animals that have to be tamed to serve them. <b>So,</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> we imagine it being possible for any Arab or Muslim to like the Jews whose character is such?...

2500|$|Three days later, Zhou Yu brought Jiang Gan {{on a tour}} of his camp, {{including}} his granaries and armouries. After that, Zhou Yu invited Jiang Gan to a feast. He instructed the servants to bring out some expensive items to show Jiang Gan. He told Jiang Gan, [...] "In his life, when a man meets a lord who truly appreciates him, he should fulfil his duty as a subject and forge a close relationship with his lord. He should follow his lord's orders faithfully and share weal and woe together with his lord. Even if Su Qin, Zhang Yi and Li Yiji were to return from the dead, they won't be able to affect his loyalty towards his lord. <b>So,</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> you ever hope to make someone switch his allegiance?"

2500|$|For his {{achievements}} in {{the conquest of}} Jing Province, Lü Meng was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Nan Commandery. He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Chanling (孱陵侯) and awarded 100 million coins and 500 jin of gold. Earlier on, Sun Quan threw a feast at Gong'an County to celebrate the victory, but Lü Meng {{did not want to}} attend because he was ill. Sun Quan laughed and said, [...] "Ziming, you deserve the honour of capturing Guan Yu. You've achieved victory but haven't received any reward yet, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> you leave now?" [...] He ordered the soldiers to play music, and personally selected subordinates for Lü Meng and the equipment required for the ceremony. After the ceremony, all the soldiers lined up along the path when Lü Meng took his leave, with music playing in the background. That was Lü Meng's finest hour.|$|E
2500|$|... "Via, Veritas, Vita" [...] is a Latin phrase {{which means}} “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” Chosen by the University as its motto, this phrase is {{attributed}} to Jesus Christ and {{is found in the}} Gospel of John chapter 14, verse 6, which reads “5Thomas said to him, [...] "Lord, we don't know where you are going, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> we know the way?"

From now on, you do know him and have seen him." [...] (New International Version) [...] The choice of the motto is firmly rooted in the University’s belief that religious instruction, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, is essential to the moral development of every young person. [...] Incidentally, the motto has been adopted by the Province of Negros Oriental by incorporating it in its provincial seal.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Bogd Khaan era, the {{positions}} of the governments of China and Russia were clear and consistent. China was adamant that Mongolia was, and must remain, an integral part of China. The (provisional) constitution of the new Chinese republic contained an uncompromising statement to this effect. A law dealing with the election of the Chinese National Assembly provided for delegates from Outer Mongolia. For their part, the Russian Imperial government accepted the principle that Mongolia must remain formally part of China; however, Russia was equally determined that Mongolia possess autonomous powers so substantial as to make it quasi-independent. Thus, in 1912 Russia concluded a secret convention with the Empire of Japan delineating their respective spheres of influence: South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia fell to the Japanese, North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to the Russians. Bogd Khaan said to Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China [...] "I established our own state before you, Mongols and Chinese have different origins, our languages and scripts are different. You're not the Manchu's descendants, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> you think China is the Manchu's successor?".|$|E
2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> you say it glorifies war?... I really don't get it." [...] He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that [...] "In the end, people see {{what they want to}} see. If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
