5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, <b>she</b> <b>can</b> be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. <b>She</b> <b>can</b> also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E

Arabelle, knowing about her daughter's intentions, instructs Daryus to follow and protect her.

Faythe arrives in the town and finds Xander, who trusts her and leads her to his father Arhys. Faythe convinces Arhys that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> help, so he brings her to Gabriel's hideout.

5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. <b>She</b> <b>can</b> scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. <b>She</b> <b>can</b> use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi <b>she</b> <b>can</b> barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom <b>she</b> <b>can</b> relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E
