25|$|Finally, {{though not}} an {{approach}} investigating {{some kind of}} rules, there is a criticism by James M. Buchanan, Charles Plott, and others. It argues that it is <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> think {{that there might be}} social preferences that are analogous to individual preferences. Arrow (1963, Chapter 8) answers this sort of criticism seen in the early period, which come at least partly from misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|Travis Fickett on IGN gave a {{negative}} review of this episode, claiming 'it misses the mark {{in almost every}} way' and 'plays like the most outrageous of fan fictions.' He claimed the 2nd Doctor and Doctor-Donna 'stretch credulity so far that it becomes translucent', and that 'it's sort of <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> even bring Rose back when you've got the episode stuffed with almost every other character from the series'.|$|E

To begin with, Rebbie did not want to use her pre-marriage surname, but later reasoned that it was <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> deny her heritage. Jackson explained that she did, however, compromise with the use of her family name on the Centipede album cover [...] "Rebbie is large and Jackson is small". She further stated that the success of siblings Michael and Janet had not been a hindrance to her, but served as an enhancement to her career. Rebbie added that she did not have to worry about [...] "name recognition".|$|E

The Wall Street Journal also raised questions about SpongeBob and Patrick in a recent article that pointed out the show's popularity in the gay community. Tom Kenny, in response to the article, said [...] " [...] felt the insinuation was a stretch." [...] "I had heard that gay viewers enjoy the show {{in the same way that}} lots of people—college students, parents and children—like the show [...] I thought it was rather <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> hang an entire article on that.

500|$|In January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for {{a promotional}} trailer {{intended}} to advertise the animated film Yellow Submarine, {{loosely based on}} the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition. Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their self-titled double album, {{also known as the}} [...] "White Album". Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: [...] "We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away... we were always fighting [...] discipline a bit, but it's <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> fight that discipline if it's our own".|$|E
500|$|Newsday critic Gene Seymour, on {{the other}} hand, stated that such {{reactions}} are misguided, writing that [...] "the movie's just too darned <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> withstand any ideological theorizing." [...] Snyder himself dismissed ideological readings, suggesting that reviewers who critique [...] "a graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys…stomping the snot out of each other" [...] using words like neocon,' 'homophobic,' 'homoerotic' or 'racist are [...] "missing the point." [...] Snyder, however, also admitted to fashioning an effeminate villain specifically to play into the homophobia of young straight males. Slovenian critic Slavoj Žižek {{pointed out that the}} story represents [...] "a poor, small country (Greece) invaded by the army of a much large state (Persia)," [...] suggesting that the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower is flawed.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Hawke {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} appearance in Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, playing {{one of the}} students taught by Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher. The Variety reviewer noted [...] "Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance." [...] The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of US$235million worldwide, it remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered {{as a result of the}} film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: [...] "I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the [...] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> pursue anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{earlier work}} was deemed [...] "vaguely funky white-soul" [...] and [...] "rock", recent ones have been judged {{to have a}} more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking {{comparisons}} to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: [...] "There's so much variety in music, it's <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way". He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: [...] "Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't {{figured out a way to}} use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing." [...] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach".|$|E
500|$|... "Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles. So I fell in with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even have to think about an album.'" [...] McCartney was occupied with working on Standing Stone in the interim.|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said that}} the episode was [...] "still satisfying, even when it's {{not one of the}} show's funnier episodes", but [...] "it's a bit of a shame this episode wasn't a home run, because having Dwight and Michael hit the clubs is a funny idea." [...] Fickett went on to praise the episode's awkward moment between Toby and Pam, when Toby placed his hand on Pam's leg, and Toby's {{subsequent}} escape by hopping the fence. Fickett stated that, for Toby's growing love of Pam, and growing jealousy of Jim, [...] "this is pretty great pay off". Claire Zulkey, a writer for the Los Angeles Times, was not as pleased with the episode. Zulkey wrote [...] "that when it's at its zaniest, The Office is at its worst", and the episode was [...] "just too <b>silly</b> <b>to</b> be funny". Zulkey did say that [...] "it was hilarious to see him [...] let his hand more-than-linger on her knee and then abruptly flee the premises by jumping over the fence and running home." [...] In a poll done by Office fansite OfficeTally.com, viewers ranked [...] "Night Out" [...] as the 13th-most popular episode out of the 14 episodes of season four.|$|E

[...] Hillenburg responded about the character's sexual orientation and stated that he is [...] " [...] cheerful character [...] is not gay." [...] He clarified that he considers the character to be [...] "almost asexual". The show's popularity among gay men would become controversial. In 2005, a promotional video, which showed SpongeBob along with other characters from children's shows singing together to promote diversity and tolerance, was attacked by an evangelical group in the United States because they saw SpongeBob being used as an [...] "advocate for homosexuality". James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the makers of the video of [...] "promoting homosexuality due to a pro-tolerance group sponsoring the video". After Dobson made the comments, Hillenburg repeated this assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Dobson later asserted that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, We Are Family Foundation. Dobson indicated that the We Are Family Foundation posted pro-homosexual material on their website, but later removed it.|$|E
