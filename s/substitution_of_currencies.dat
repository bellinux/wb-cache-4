50|$|In {{situations}} of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency {{for the local}} currency. The U.S. dollar {{is viewed as a}} relatively stable and safe currency and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent <b>of</b> all U.S. <b>currency,</b> was believed to be circulating abroad. The most recent study of the amount <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> held overseas suggests that only 25 percent <b>of</b> U.S. <b>currency</b> is presently held abroad. The widespread <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> U.S. <b>currency</b> for local currency is known as de facto dollarisation, and has been observed in transition countries such as Cambodia and in some Latin American countries. Some countries, such as Ecuador, abandoned their local currency and now use US dollars, essentially for this reason, a process known as de jure dollarization. See also the example of the Ghanaian cedi from the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{money has}} been defined as an {{electronic}} substitute for banknotes and coins that is recorded on an electronic medium, either a smart card or computer hard drive, for the purpose of effecting electronic payments in limited amounts. Digital money products, designed to substitute central bank currency, could in principle replace the entire stock <b>of</b> central bank <b>currency.</b> Since central bank currency is a component in all monetary aggregates, a change in demand for this currency could affect these aggregates. The largest impact would be on the narrowly defined stock of money, M 1, which in many countries consists of cash in circulation, travellers cheques held by the public and demand deposits. Other monetary aggregates, such as M 2 or M 3, could also be affected, but to a lesser extent given that cash in circulation carries less weight in these aggregates. The size of the stock <b>of</b> central bank <b>currency</b> in circulation, the size of demand deposit, and their relative weight represent the first indicators of the potential effect of a replacement <b>of</b> central bank <b>currency</b> on the M 1 money supply. The impact of digital money on M 1 will depend on three factors: (1) the willingness of the banking sector to use its deposits, (2) the reserve requirements on digital money balances and demand deposits, and (3) the precise definition of M 1. In addition, the reaction of central banks plays a crucial role since they have the means to offset any change in M 1. <b>Substitution</b> <b>of</b> central bank <b>currency</b> would affect all monetary aggregates. For the purposes of simplification, we shall take M 1 where the money supply contains only cash in circulation, C, and demand deposits, D. Digital money balances, EM, may also be included in the definition of M 1. Such a conversion would affect M 1 through two channels. Obviously, a <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>currency</b> would affect M 1 through a reduction in the stock <b>of</b> central bank <b>currency.</b> A conversion would, however, also change the reserve position of banks and, eventually, the size o...|$|R
40|$|The {{devaluation}} of the Mexican peso of 1995 along with the more recent financial crises in emerging economies are viewed as systematic outcomes of the operation <b>of</b> free <b>currency</b> markets. The hypothesis is that there exists a distortion in free currency markets that makes developing countries systematically misallocate resources. The distortion lies in "asymmetric reputation" that leads to <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the reserve <b>currency</b> for the country's soft currency in liquid asset holdings, thus making systemic devaluations inevitable. Moreover, the empirical analysis shows that currency-substitution-led endemic devaluations misallocate resources in competitive devaluation trade, as opposed to comparative advantage trade. In a case that is parallel to asymmetric information and incomplete credit markets, the appropriate policy intervention in asymmetric-reputation driven incomplete currency markets is maintaining mildly repressed exchange rates. The operational definition of "mild" is imposing restrictions on the home-grown variety <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> Asymmetric reputation; incomplete markets; contractionary devaluations; free currency markets...|$|R

The {{focus is on}} substitution between dollar and euro balances in the three basic functions of money â€“ unit of account, store of value and means of payment. While traditional models for currency substitution concentrate on substitution between a domestic currency and aggregate foreign currency balances, we look for substitution between the dollar and the euro or euro-related foreign currency balances. We find substitution between dollarization and euroization to be asymmetric in the short run, which suggests that inertia, irreversibility and ratchet effects favour the euro.

The birth of the euro has led, after 1999, a profound change in the exchange rate policy in Morocco. On the one hand, the automatic component of the adjustment of the exchange rate of dirham: slipping according to the inflation differential between Morocco and its partners has been abandoned; domestic inflation has been stabilized at a level comparable to that of developed economies. On the other hand, the <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> European national <b>currencies</b> by the euro, synonymous with a decrease in the variety <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> used in the composition of the basket, the tradeoff between stabilizing the debt burden and maintaining external competitiveness vis-Ã -vis European trade partners, have led the monetary Moroccan authorities to diversify the composition of the basket by introducing new currencies outside the European area, it is the British Pound and perhaps Franc Switzerland. ...|$|R

But starting with 2000, it is observed a credit channel reactivation and, especially, interest rate channel.

To direct the employment of these is a problem deserving the most serious attention of Congress. If employment can be given to all the labor offering itself, prosperity necessarily follows.

This study {{explores the}} importance <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> phenomena, encountered mostly in high inflation countries rather than other countries. First, it investigates {{the causes and}} consequences <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> It then employs a measure <b>of</b> the <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> to estimate the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> between two currencies; national and foreign currencies in a money-in-the-utility framework. The utility function of representative agents includes consumption and money services separately and is linear in consumption. Money services are produced by combining domestic and foreign real balances in Constant Elasticity <b>of</b> <b>Substitution</b> production function. The presence of money services in the utility function is to indicate the transaction costs reducing properties <b>of</b> the two <b>currencies.</b> Ten high inflation countries are analyzed for the empirical measurements. Assumed as small, open economies each of these countries is compared {{to the rest of}} the world represented by the United States. The shares of domestic and foreign real balances, the discount factors, the shares of money services in the utility functions and the elasticities <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> are directly estimated by Hansenâ€™s Generalized Method of Moments procedure. The fact that inflation reduces the credibility <b>of</b> domestic <b>currency</b> leads to high elasticity <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> between two <b>currencies</b> in the market of high inflation countries. In other words, the public is vulnerable to the changes in the relative prices while deciding their money allocations and <b>currency</b> <b>substitution</b> is <b>of</b> first-order importance in these countries.

It can be essentially {{understood as the}} <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the functions <b>of</b> domestic <b>currency</b> by foreign currency, and can also be analysed from the aspect of the motive of demand for money. Among all the determinants <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> the changes in exchange rate have mainly influenced the degree <b>of</b> the <b>currency</b> <b>substitution.</b> The impacts <b>of</b> Renminbi effective exchange rate on currency substitution between Jan. 2004 to June 2012 are analysed empirically in the paper. The Johansen test results {{that there is an}} equilibrium long run co-integration relationship among the currency substitution and RMB effective exchange rates and its volatility series. The VECM reveals a short run effect of the effective exchange rate factors on the equilibrium <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>substitution,</b> but the elasticity is limited. The downward tendency <b>of</b> RMB <b>substitution</b> since 2004 is principally on account of an increase in the amount of money supply, which {{is a direct result of}} the continuous appreciation in RMB exchange rate.

40|$|It {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} to fully understand the developments and problems of European economic and monetary integration without examining its historical and political background. European monetary integration has at times been propelled, at times been hindered by political motives and developments. Political motivations were already of great importance for the first stage of European economic and monetary integration in the framework of the OEEC and the European Payments Union in the forties and fifties. Even more for the creation of the European Communities (ECSC, EURATOM, EEC) in the fifties. However, considerations of national sovereignty and diverse if not conflicting concepts of economic and monetary policy priorities resulted in the virtual exclusion of economic and monetary policies from any serious attempts of coordination and harmonization. The completion of the EEC customs union and the monetary crises in the late sixties led to a major effort in economic and monetary policy integration culminating in the Werner Plan of 1970. The only result of these efforts was the "snake" which, while in the end shrinking to {{not much more than a}} DM zone, provided some framework for monetary cooperation. and The economic difficulties of the seventies on a European and global scale but also the desire to boost the political momentum behind European integration led to the EMS. Political considerations played an important role not only in reviving the process toward Economic and Monetary Union which led to the Delors Report but also in the specific design of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and in the premature notion of the EMS as a de facto monetary union. Contrary to many expectations, the EMS crises in 1992 and 1993 did not lead to an abandonment of the objectives of the Maastricht Treaty but resulted in efforts - for political as well as economic reasons - to salvage the EMS and to continue with efforts aimed at economic convergence for the core of the EMS countries. Strong adherence to national sovereignty, insufficient economic convergence, and difficulties in agreeing on meaningful elements of political union undermined until now attempts to create EMU.
