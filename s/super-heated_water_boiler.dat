40|$|In {{engineering}} practice exergy {{can be used}} for technical and economic optimization of energy conversion processes. The problem of increasing energy consumption suggests that heating plants, i. e. hot <b>water</b> <b>boilers,</b> as energy suppliers for household heating should be subjected to exergy and energy analysis. Heating plants are typically designed to meet energy demands, without the distinguished difference between quality and quantity of the produced heat. In this paper, the energy and exergy analysis of a gas fired hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> is conducted. Energy analysis gives only quantitative results, while exergy analysis provides an insight into the actually available useful energy with respect to the system environment. In this paper, a hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> was decomposed into control volumes with respect to its functional components. Energy and exergy of the created physical model of the hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> is performed and destruction of exergy and energy loss in each of the components is calculated. The paper describes the current state of energy and exergy efficiency of the hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler.</b> The obtained results are analyzed and used to investigate possibilities for improvement of availability and reliability of the boiler. A comparison between the actual and the proposed more reliable solution is made...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The most {{commonly}} used central units in the district heating system are most certainly hot <b>water</b> <b>boilers.</b> Experience in exploitation {{as well as their}} former development have given rise to new demands and possibilities of using hot <b>water</b> <b>boilers</b> for achieving a more efficient utilization of fuel. Yet, the current trend is not only for an efficient operation in terms of energy efficiency of primary fuel, but it also comprises many strict requirements {{when it comes to a}} cost-effective, reliable and safe operation. A mathematical- empirical model of the hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> during the start-up process is presented in this paper. The dynamic behavior of the object will be discussed in the start-up regime because it represents one of the most critical transient regimes during the operation...|$|R

Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials are unsure of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water.

The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems.

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (<b>Water</b> <b>Boiler)</b> Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|R
50|$|The process {{creating}} the earthquakes of 1 and 2 July {{is considered to}} have been driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma <b>super-heating</b> <b>water</b> trapped within the edifice of the volcano. It {{is unlikely that the}} trapped waters could vapourise due to being under considerable pressure. What is postulated is that the waters were heated to a point where they could not absorb further thermal energy in the available space. Continuing heating required the water to expand further and the only way it could do so was to move the flank of the volcano. This caused the two earthquakes that were reported as occurring during the eruption along with the development of the crack.|$|R

50|$|As the American Sulphur Company was abandoning its efforts, Frasch, {{with the}} backing of Frank Rockefeller, Feargus B.

Frasch had learned about the well-publicized sulfur mining failures, and purchased land adjacent to the American Sulphur Company's land. He assumed that the sulfur deposits extended laterally underneath his property, and he planned to extract the sulfur with a new method. He would pump <b>super-heated</b> <b>water</b> down a pipe into the sulfur to melt it, and pump compressed air down a second pipe to force the molten sulfur up through a third pipe.
