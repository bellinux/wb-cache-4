5000|$|Some of the ions' {{kinetic energy}} is {{transferred}} to the cathode. This happens partially through <b>the</b> ions <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> cathode directly. The primary mechanism, however, is less direct. Ions <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> more numerous neutral gas atoms, transferring {{a portion of their}} energy to them. These neutral atoms then <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> cathode. Whichever species (ions or atoms) <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> cathode, collisions within the cathode redistribute this energy resulting in electrons ejected from the cathode. This process is known as secondary electron emission. Once free of the cathode, the electric field accelerates electrons into the bulk of the glow discharge. Atoms can then be excited by collisions with ions, electrons, or other atoms that have been previously excited by collisions.|$|R

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball <b>strikes</b> <b>the</b> batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell <b>strikes,</b> <b>the</b> water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
