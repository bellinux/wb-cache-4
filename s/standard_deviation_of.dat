5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years with a <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
25|$|When only {{a sample}} of data from a {{population}} is available, the term <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the sample or sample standard deviation can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the entire population).|$|E

25|$|Divergence Angle: The {{representative}} {{range of}} leeway angles for {{a category of}} leeway objects. It can be calculated by obtaining the net leeway angle over time for a specific leeway object’s drift trajectory, and then averaging again {{for a series of}} leeway drift trajectories of a number of leeway objects in a leeway category, to determine the mean leeway angle and <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the leeway angle for the category. Divergence angle is then calculated as twice the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the leeway angle, or mean plus one <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the leeway angle, or mean plus two standard deviations of the leeway angle depending on the particular study.|$|E

25|$|The {{linearity}} of the zROC curve {{depends on}} the standard deviations of the target and lure strength distributions. If the standard deviations are equal, the slope will be 1.0. If the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the target strength distribution {{is larger than the}} <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> the lure strength distribution, then the slope will be smaller than 1.0. In most studies, it has been found that the zROC curve slopes constantly fall below 1, usually between 0.5 and 0.9. Many experiments yielded a zROC slope of 0.8. A slope of 0.8 implies that the variability of the target strength distribution is 25% larger than the variability of the lure strength distribution.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who died}} of {{multiple}} organ failure additionally exhibited signs of skin hemorrhaging and necrosis, though both are otherwise rare. The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings.

Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (with a <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 12) while those who survived suffered 28 stings (with a <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 4).|$|E
