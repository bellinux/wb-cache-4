40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 The first essay, {{entitled}} "Sectoral Adjustment Costs and Real Exchange Rate Dynamics in a Two-Sector Dependent Economy," investigates {{dynamics of}} real exchange rates in a two-sector model with both capital accumulation and capital reallocation. Instead of choosing {{one of the}} extreme assumptions regarding production structure (gradual capital accumulation with instantaneous reallocation versus no reallocation), we allow the movement of capital across sectors but with costs. By appropriately parameterizing this cost, {{we find that the}} standard Heckscher-Ohlin and the sector-specific capital models emerge as two polar cases. We also get persistence of the deviation of the real exchange rate, with the persistence, and possible overshooting, of the real exchange rate increasing with the magnitude of the intersectoral adjustment costs, consistent with the evidence. The second essay, entitled "Sectoral Adjustment Costs and The Rate of Convergence in a Two-Sector Endogenous Growth Model" investigates the speed of convergence in a Lucas type two-sector model with <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. In two-sector endogenous growth models of Lucas vintage all variables converge to their respective long-run equilibrium at the same constant rate. By introducing <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs we obtain stable dynamic adjustment paths as two-dimensional manifolds. So, convergence speeds vary over time and among variables. Also, the time path of the rate of convergence depends {{on the size of the}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. As different countries have different <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, the cross-country variations in convergence profile can be addressed using this framework.

After explicitly controlling for external shocks and nonprogram determinants of performance, the authors find that adjustment lending programs have usually increased the growth rate of GDP and the ratio of exports to GDP, and have increased the saving-to-GDP ratio over early 1980 s levels. But the average ratio of investment to GDP has fallen below 1970 s levels. For countries that have reduced most of their policy inefficiencies, achieving a sustainable growth rate in the 1990 s will require higher investment rates than those achieved in the 1980 s.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{structural}} adjustment policies on poor countries {{has been one of}} the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans,</b> which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans,</b> and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.|$|R
