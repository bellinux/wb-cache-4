40|$|Accurate {{accounting}} of surface emissivity {{is essential for}} the retrievals of surface temperature from remote sensing measurements, and for the computations of longwave (LW) radiation budget of the Earth?s surface. Past studies of the above topics assumed that emissivity for all <b>surface</b> <b>types,</b> and across the entire LW spectrum is equal to unity. There is strong evidence, however, that emissivity of many surface materials is significantly lower than unity, and varies considerably across the LW spectrum. We have developed global maps of surface emissivity for the broadband LW region, the thermal infrared window region (8 - 12 micron), and 12 narrow LW spectral bands. The 17 <b>surface</b> <b>types</b> defined by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) were adopted as such, and an additional (18 th) <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> was introduced to represent tundra-like surfaces. Laboratory measurements of spectral reflectances of 10 different surface materials were converted to corresponding emissivities. The 10 surface materials were then associated with 18 <b>surface</b> <b>types.</b> Emissivities for the 18 <b>surface</b> <b>types</b> were first computed for each of the 12 narrow spectral bands.

40|$|Spectral {{interpretation}} that silicic rocks are widespread on Mars implies that Earth's differentiated crust is not unique. Evaluation of observations {{bearing on the}} composition of the Martian crust (Martian meteorite petrology and a possible crustal assimilant, analysis of Mars Pathfinder rocks, composition of Martian fines, interpretation of spacecraft thermal emission spectra, and inferred crustal densities) indicates that the crust can be either basalt plus andesite or basalt plus weathering products. New calculated chemical compositions for Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) global surface units indicate that <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 1 has basaltic andesite composition and <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 2 has the composition of andesite. If these materials represent volcanic rocks, their calc-alkaline compositions on a FeO*/MgO versus silica diagram suggest formation by hydrous melting and fractional crystallization. On Earth, this petrogenesis requires subduction, and it may suggest an early period of plate tectonics on Mars. However, anorogenic production of andesite might have been possible if the primitive Martian mantle was wet. Alternatively, chemical weathering diagrams suggest that <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 2 materials could have formed by partial weathering of <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 1 rocks, leading to depletion in soluble cations and mobility of silica. A weathered crust model is consistent with the occurrence of <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 2 materials as sediments in a depocenter and with the alpha proton X-ray spectrometer (APXS) analysis of excess oxygen suggesting weathering rinds on Pathfinder rocks. If <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> 1 materials are also weathered or mixed with weathered materials, this might eliminate the need for hydrous melting, consistent with a relatively dry Martian mantle without tectonics...|$|R

40|$|Surface albedo, {{a primary}} {{control on the}} amount of energy {{available}} for melt, has considerable spatial heterogeneity across the Greenland ice sheet ablation area. However, the relative importance of distinct <b>surface</b> <b>types</b> on albedo remains unclear. In this study, the causes of mesoscale (102 to 103 ?m) albedo variability are assessed using high resolution (decimetre-scale) digital imagery and broadband albedo data acquired by a fixed-wing unmanned aerial system. We characterize the reflectance properties and terrain roughness associated with six distinct <b>surface</b> <b>types</b> identified from a 25 ?km longitudinal transect across the ablating dark region of the Kangerlussuaq sector. Principal component analysis of the fractional area of each <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> versus coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data reveals the relative importance of each <b>surface</b> <b>type.</b> The highest correlation with mesoscale albedo was the fractional area of distributed impurities. Although not the darkest <b>surface</b> <b>type,</b> their extensive coverage meant that they could explain 65 ?% of the albedo variability across the survey transect including the presence of the dark region. In contrast, the 2 ?% mean surface water coverage across our survey transect could only explain 12 ?% of albedo variation and crevasses, only 17 ?%. Localised cryoconite patches have the lowest albedo signature but comprise less than 1 ?% of the survey area and do not appear to reduce mesoscale albedo. We anticipate further reduction in ablation area albedo under future warming as localized areas of distributed impurities, supraglacial water and crevassing increase in extent and conclude that current bare ice area albedo models may advance significantly by representing the evolution of the <b>surface</b> <b>types</b> identified in this studypublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of simple, {{low-cost}} infrared sensors for the recognition of geometry and <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> of commonly encountered features or targets in indoor environments, such as planes, corners, and edges. The intensity measurements obtained from such sensors are highly dependent on the location, geometry, and surface properties of the reflecting target {{in a way that}} cannot be represented by a simple analytical relationship, therefore complicating the localization and recognition process. We employ artificial neural networks to determine the geometry and the <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> of targets and provide experimental verification with three different geometries and three different <b>surface</b> <b>types.</b> The networks are trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and pruned with the optimal brain surgeon technique. The geometry and the <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> of targets can be correctly classified with rates of 99 and 78. 4 %, respectively. An average correct classification rate of 78 % is achieved when both geometry and <b>surface</b> <b>type</b> are differentiated. This indicates that the geometrical properties of the targets are more distinctive than their surface properties, and surface determination is the limiting factor in recognizing the patterns. The results demonstrate that processing the data from simple infrared sensors through suitable techniques can help us exploit their full potential and extend their usage beyond well-known applications. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R

40|$|The Mars Global Surveyor mission {{carries a}} remote-sensing gizmo called the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). TES detects heat waves {{flowing from the}} surface of the Red Planet. The TES team, led by Phil Christensen (Arizona State University), {{identified}} two large regions on Mars that have distinctive spectral properties. Using mathematical mixing calculations based on the thermal emission spectra of numerous materials, the TES team reported in papers led by Josh Bandfield and Victoria Hamilton that the two regions had mineral abundances similar to basalt (<b>Surface</b> <b>Type</b> 1) and andesite (<b>Surface</b> <b>Type</b> 2), two common volcanic rock types on Earth. Andesite has more silicon than does basalt, giving rise to a distinctive mineralogy. Scientists had mixed reactions to the possibility of andesite on Mars, greeting the news with fascination, consternation, or skepticism. One question raised is how uniquely the spectra of <b>Surface</b> <b>Type</b> 2 matches andesite. Michael Wyatt and Harry Y. McSween (University of Tennessee) have taken another look at the TES spectra by using a larger collection of aqueous alteration (weathering) products in the spectral mixing calculations. They show that weathered basalt also matches the spectral properties of <b>Surface</b> <b>Type</b> 2. Wyatt and McSween also note that Type 2 regions are generally confined to a large, low region that is the site of a purported Martian ocean that sloshed around billions of years ago. They suggest that basalts like those in <b>Surface</b> <b>Type</b> 1 were altered in the ancient Martian sea. Independent data are needed to test the andesite vs. altered-basalt hypotheses.
