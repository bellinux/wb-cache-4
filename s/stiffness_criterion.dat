As well as satisfying strength and <b>stiffness</b> <b>criteria,</b> the final laminate design has to be manufacturable in terms of compatibility between adjacent panels, thus introducing conflicting constraints on the allowed laminate stacking sequences. An attempt to automate the laminate design process is described. The method uses a mixture of a genetic algorithm and heuristics to satisfy the various design and manufacturing constraints. Multiple zones are allowed, where each zone defines a panel together {{with a set of}} applied loads. Guide laminates and a blending methodology allow each zone to share common plies.

40|$|The {{cooling time}} of an {{injection}} molded part directly affects the production cost and efficiency. In order to accurately estimate the cooling time, {{it is necessary}} to define the ejection condition. One common criterion for part ejection is when the mean or maximal temperature is equal or less than an estimated ejection temperature, Te [1]. But in industrial practice, the ejection condition is determined by the part’s deformation or warpage due to ejection forces and subsequent cooling [2]. This research uses a combination of experimental, analytical, and statistical methods to discuss different ejection criteria and their rationality, thereby developing a more effective criterion based on part stiffness. This <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> facilitates more accurate estimation of cooling time at early stages of product development.

A first order formulation is developed for describing the tow handle trajectory in terms of the system geometry, the skier’s grip strength and the mechanical properties of the tow rope. A rope <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> is established that guarantees the released tow handle will fall harmlessly into the water as opposed to striking the motorboat.

40|$|Large scale floor {{convergence}} {{and sudden}} failure of pillars in room-and pillar underground mining {{have been reported}} in various countries over many years. Failure of these mines has been attributed, amongst other causes, to the <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> used by the mining operators and most importantly mine design practices, that tend to reduce the width-to-height ratio i. e. slender pillars in pursuit of greater coal recovery yields, in order to maximize coal recovery in the seam. It is recorded that the room-and-pillar method can leave behind about 40 % of the total coal available for mining. The current study seeks to determine the appropriate width-height ratio for coal composite and stabilized coal pillars. Pure coal was mixed with granular soil and stabilized with cement to form cylindrical composite columns which were crushed to determine their unconfined compressive strength at different width-to-height ratios. The strength increased with the increase in W/H of the columns. Increase in coal percentage in a composite reduces the strength. The stabilized coal pillars mobilized less strength than the composite pillars.

An important feature of the technique {{is that it can}} be used at high speeds, including the transonic range. Model wings are attached to a solid-fuel rocket which has a miniature telemetry set housed in a detachable nose fairing. A vibration pick-up and break wires are fitted in the flutter model and these modulate the output of the telemetry set to transmit flutter information to a ground station. The rocket is fired over an open artillery range and its velocity-time curve is obtained by radio reflection Doppler equipment. Results are given of tests on flutter models of unswept, untapered wings in the range of Mach number from 0 - 4 to 1 - 0. The effects of longitudinal acceleration on the flutter are shown to be negligible for the range of acceleration and Mach number investigated, and the effect of compressibility is to reduce the margin of the measured speed above the speed calculated on the basis of incompressible flow theory from + 50 per cent at M = 0 - 4 to [...] 25 per cent at M = 0 - 9.

40|$|This work {{analyzed}} multi length-scale composites from {{an experimental}} and modeling perspective. Three main experiments were conducted: fatigue of foam and pin-reinforced foam cores, indentation prevention using load spreaders, and nanotube reinforcement for increased interlaminar strength. A method for determining cycles to failure for a sandwich panel was established using an empirical model. The fatigue response is captured by conducting experiments at varying stress levels to determine empirical constants. Stress-softening is observed in 92 % of tests under varying fatigue cases, even at low stress amplitudes. A <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> {{can be developed}} to estimate failure such that once a reduced level of stiffness is reached a structure is removed from service.

For design purposes the model allows the minimum spreader dimension to be determined by inputting the expected load on a joint. Carbon nanotubes were grown on the surface of carbon and glass fibers using CVD. The heat of the reaction and exposure to high temperature were limited to prevent fiber damage. Nanotubes longer than two times the fiber diameter negatively impact the fiber volume fraction which reduces interlaminar strength, but high densities of short nanotubes improve interlaminar strength.

40|$|Engineered wood {{products}} for structural use must meet minimum strength and <b>stiffness</b> <b>criteria.</b> This represents {{a major challenge}} for the industry as the mechanical properties of the wood resource are inherently variable. We report on a case study that was conducted in a laminated veneer lumber (LVL) mill {{in order to test}} the potential of an acoustic sensor to predict structural properties of the wood resource prior to processing. A population of 266 recently harvested aspen logs were segregated into three sub-populations based on measurements of longitudinal acoustic speed in wood using a hand tool equipped with a resonance-based acoustic sensor. Each of the three sub-populations were peeled into veneer sheets and graded for stiffness with an ultrasonic device. The average ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) of each subpopulation was 418, 440 and 453 microseconds for the green, blue, and red populations, respectively. This resulted in contrasting proportions of structural veneer grades, indicating that the efficiency of the forest value chain could be improved using acoustic sensors.

3000|$|... [...]), a lithological {{description}} of rock chips and a thorough search for published laboratory data will likely provide decent first-order estimates. Especially in intensely fractured intervals, the rock mass strength will {{be dominated by}} the rock mass characteristics, such that a first-order estimate of intact strength and stiffness will be sufficient as a starting point. Therefore, armed with a detailed {{description of}} the borehole or well wall from wireline log data (fracture density, in particular), one can assess rock mass strength and elastic modulus, important for a wide range of modelling scenarios (e.g. McClure and Horne 2013 and references therein) and stimulation strategies (Cipolla et al. 2008). We recommend that this simple, yet well-established, engineering method be used to characterise geothermal reservoirs worldwide to empirically establish its validity under reservoir and small diameter wellbore conditions. A possible technique would be to measure reservoir deformation during stimulation using distributed deformation measurements in wellbores using fibre optic technology as has been used for rock slope deformation monitoring (e.g. Moore et al. 2010). We also recommend that core and wellbore characterisation be undertaken such that fracture frequency, orientation, infilling and roughness for natural fractures are collected at a resolution that allows computation of the rock mass strength and <b>stiffness</b> <b>criteria.</b> Finally we recommend that wireline techniques, such as gamma ray (Bigelow 1992), be used to explore the possibility of identifying clay infilling signatures for joint condition assessment (as in Meller and Ledésert 2017).|$|R
40|$|The aim of log grading for pricing is {{to apply}} an {{economic}} value based on volume and log grade. However, unlike many other commodities logs are hard to characterize into different grades. The reasons are: internal properties are hard to decide from the external appearance, the wood properties are often heterogeneous {{and there are a}} variety of different grading criterias. In Sweden, as in many other countries, the log grading is based on visual assessment of log characteristics, which can be considered intricate, time consuming and monotonous. Moreover, factors like increasing labour cost, structural changes among sawmills and the introduction of new technology, are all changing the possibilities and demands for the sawmills. New technology is important in order for the sawmill industry to remain competitive and therefore the log grading system for pricing needs to become more flexible and adaptable to the new technology. This thesis investigates two different methods using automatic measuring techniques to grade logs for pricing. In the first method a 3 D log scanner is used to estimate log shape and this information is used to grade the log. The accuracy when using 3 D log scanning to grade logs, according to the grades in the current Swedish national grading system, was comparable with but somewhat lower than manual grading of logs. Scanner data were used to estimate curvature type and compression wood content. Models based on log scanner data could discriminate between curvature types if the curvature was severe and bow height larger than 0. 8 %. The models predicting compression wood were significant even though models using log end information were better. Analysis of whole stems showed that compression wood content was most pronounced near ground level and that stems with basal sweep more often had large amounts of severe compression wood. The second technique used acoustics and the results indicate that the technique has potential for grading logs by the stiffness of the sawn timber. The <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> was more important for spruce saw logs since spruce lumber is more often used for construction purposes. Using 3 D scanning, acoustic methods and other techniques would probably reduce costs and make log grading for pricing more efficient. To enable this, the log grading system needs to be simplified and adapted to the new automatic technologies. Based on the findings in this thesis, a base for a new grading system for pine and spruce is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil depletion, drive a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass fibre substitute from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg retted flax straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg flax hackled long fibre show that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal <b>stiffness</b> <b>criterion</b> under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its biobased alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For wheat gluten production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the wheat cultivation and gluten drying phase are dominant in the majority of the impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with wheat gluten film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favourable from an environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film. Although wheat gluten film suffers from common problems for biobased materials (e. g. land occupation), the overall environmental performance indicates that wheat gluten represents a promising source for biobased polymer productionTABLE OF CONTENT TABLE OF CONTENT	I LIST OF FIGURES	V LIST OF TABLES	VII LIST OF ABRIVATIONS	IX ABSTRACT	XI SAMENVATTING	XIII CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1.

40|$|The {{strength}} of FRP composites in civil infrastructure applications is often {{considered to be}} a secondary consideration, as design is driven by <b>stiffness</b> <b>criteria.</b> However, the long-term performance of FRP in such applications is not well understood. Initially high factors of safety can be reduced by ply-level degradation and changes in failure mode caused by environmental aging and fatigue loading. FRP structures under transverse loading frequently fail by delamination at material or geometric discontinuities. The stress state at these discontinuities is complex and difficult to predict, and the critical stresses are very sensitive to loading, fiber architecture, and ply-level changes with time/exposure. Furthermore, the out-of-plane strength at a delamination site may also be affected by environmental aging. The present study considers several beam and sandwich type models to more accurately determine ply-level stresses that might lead to delamination at the ply level or at the web/flange interface of a structural beam. These models permit a relatively simple estimation of in-plane stresses which should be more accurate than those predicted using simple beam theory. They can capture such effects as load concentrations under point or patch loads, flange stresses due to web compression, and shear effects in both the web and flanges. Such models are advantageous as they permit analytic solutions, and they can be easily integrated into strength and life predictions which rely on iterative stress analyses and remaining strength calculations. The long-term objective of this work is to predict delamination failures in FRP thin-walled beams and sandwich beams under combined fatigue loading and environmental conditioning, using a simplified engineering approach. A more complete finite element model is also developed for verification. ...|$|R
