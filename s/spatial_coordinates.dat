5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a duality symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> do not change, and a term known as the twist potential {{is analogous to the}} aforementioned duality between E and B.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, it {{was shown}} that for finite-amplitude waves the {{convergence}} of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the periodic wave problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the periodic wave problem as used by Stokes – with the <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> as a function of velocity potential and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the Eulerian frame of reference (with the velocity potential or stream function {{as a function of the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates).</b>|$|E

25|$|So Heisenberg {{set out to}} {{formulate}} these results without any explicit dependence on the virtual oscillator model. To do this, he replaced the Fourier expansions for the <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> by matrices, matrices which corresponded to the transition coefficients in the virtual oscillator method. He justified this replacement by an appeal to Bohr’s correspondence principle and the Pauli doctrine that quantum mechanics must be limited to observables.|$|E

25|$|It may {{be simple}} {{to write down}} the {{equations}} of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always {{the most efficient way}} to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.|$|E
25|$|Transformations {{describing}} {{relative motion}} with constant (uniform) velocity and without {{rotation of the}} space coordinate axes are called boosts, and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> only, these are also inertial frames {{since there is no}} relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., axis–angle representation, or Euler angles, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a homogeneous transformation, which transforms the origin back to the origin.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} physics, equations {{of motion}} are equations that describe the behaviour of a physical system {{in terms of its}} motion as a function of time. More specifically, the {{equations of motion}} describe the behaviour of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables: normally <b>spatial</b> <b>coordinates</b> and time are used, but others are also possible, such as momentum components and time. The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. The functions are defined in a Euclidean space in classical mechanics, but are replaced by curved spaces in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions to the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics.|$|E

25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation).
