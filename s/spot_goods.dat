40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a two-period {{general equilibrium model}} with uncertainty and real assets as financial instruments. The novelty of the analysis is that real assets are the stocks of neoclassical firms, so that both returns and yields depend on anticipated <b>spot</b> <b>goods</b> prices (and, of course, the yield matrix may change rank with prices). Assuming that financial markets are potentially complete, we establish generic existence of financial equilibrium and prove that there exists a dense set of economies such that financial equilibria are efficient.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to relate the General Equilibrium Theory and modern Finance Theory. We work with an {{infinite}} dimensional economy with a market for goods an actives, and where the number of agents is finite. Each agent has an intertemporal utility function with uncertainty on the states of the world. We characterize the equilibrium with actives and <b>spot</b> <b>goods</b> and analyze sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium in this case. We show that it is possible to extend to infinite dimensional models the Chichilnisky theorem on uniqueness of equilibrium. Finally we analyze payoffs and prices of actives that follow Ito processes in a CCAPM frame. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays in Financial and Monetary Economics. ^ In the first essay, I consider a two-period general equilibrium model with uncertainty and real assets as financial instruments. The novelty of the analysis is that real assets are the stocks of neoclassical firms, so that both returns and yields depend on anticipated <b>spot</b> <b>goods</b> prices (and, of course, the yield matrix may change rank with prices). Assuming that financial markets are potentially complete, I establish generic existence of financial equilibrium and prove that there exists a dense set of economies such that financial equilibria are efficient. ^ In the second essay, I generalize the standard search-theoretic model of monetary exchange by allowing both divisible goods and general utility functions, and by introducing heterogeneity across agents {{in terms of their}} production costs. I analyze how such factors as the supply of money, trading frictions and differences in productivity of agents influence the state of the economy. I show that there exists a cut-off type such that all types with marginal productivity lower than the cut-off do not produce or trade for money. ^ In the third essay, I consider a risk-neutral, price-taking and value-maximizing firm under demand uncertainty. The firm chooses optimal investment strategies; the investment is irreversible. For a wide family of non-Gaussian processes, I derive an explicit formula for the boundary of the inaction region by using the Wiener-Hopf factorization method. As an application of the method, I suggest a Marshallian-like form for the investment rule. It is applicable when the price can move in both directions, and uses the infimum process of the price instead of the price process itself. I also write down an analytic formula for the expected level of the capital stock in terms of the infimum and supremum processes. Both results are new even for the Gaussian case. ...|$|E

The microstructures of Ti 6 Al 4 V were complex and strongly affected the mechanical properties. These structures include: a´ martensite, metastable ß, Widmanstätten, bimodal, lamellar and equiaxed microstructure. Bimodal and Widmanstätten structures exhibit a good-balance between strength and ductility. The microstructure of pulsed Nd:YAG welded Ti 6 Al 4 V was primarily a´ martensite, which showed the lowest ductility but not significantly high strength. A heat treatment at 950 followed by furnace cooling can transform the microstructure in the weld from a´ martensite structure into Widmanstätten structure...|$|R
