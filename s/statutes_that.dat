5|$|Justinian's {{religious}} policy {{reflected the}} Imperial {{conviction that the}} unity of the Empire presupposed unity of faith, and it appeared to him obvious that this faith could only be the orthodox (Nicaean). Those of a different belief were subjected to persecution, which imperial legislation had effected from the time of Constantius II and which would now vigorously continue. The Codex contained two <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> decreed the total destruction of paganism, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position. In 529, the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens was placed under state control as paganism, strangling this training school for this branch of Hellenistic philosophy..|$|E

25|$|Conservative white Democrats had regained {{power in}} the state {{legislature}} and begun to pass <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> stripped African Americans from voter rolls or made elections so complicated they were effectively disenfranchised. In 1901 the state passed a new constitution with provisions that created barriers to voter registration. These suppressed voting by most blacks, as well as tens of thousands of poor whites.|$|E
25|$|Hastings {{is active}} in {{educational}} philanthropy and politics. One of the issues Hastings most strongly advocates is charter schools, publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed {{from some of the}} rules, regulations, and <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> apply to other public schools, in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results, which are set forth in each school's charter.|$|E
25|$|After the French Revolution the anticlerical {{feeling in}} Catholic {{countries}} {{coupled with the}} liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code {{made it possible to}} sweep away sodomy laws. However, in Protestant countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Previously, in 1998, {{the state}} had enacted a Defense of Marriage Act that {{restricted}} marriage to different-sex couples, reinforcing its <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> had been interpreted by a state court in 1974 as imposing the same restriction. Several lawsuits filed in state court challenged the state's marriage laws without success, including one filed in 1971, {{one of the first}} such cases in the United States.|$|E
25|$|After the Readjuster Party disappeared, Virginia Democrats rapidly passed {{legislation}} and constitutional amendments that effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites, {{through the use}} of poll taxes and literacy tests. They created white, one-party rule under the Democratic Party for the next 80 years. White state legislators passed <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> restored white supremacy through imposition of Jim Crow segregation. In 1902 Virginia passed a new constitution that reduced voter registration.|$|E
25|$|Several {{states have}} enacted {{so-called}} trigger laws which would take {{effect in the}} event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, with the effect of outlawing abortions on the state level. Those states include Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota. Additionally, many states did not repeal pre-1973 <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> criminalized abortion, and some of those statutes could again be in force if Roe were reversed.|$|E

25|$|Coker v. Georgia, , {{held that}} the death penalty for rape of an adult woman was grossly disproportionate and {{excessive}} punishment, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A few states continued to have child rape <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> authorized the death penalty. In Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), the court expanded Coker, ruling {{that the death penalty}} is unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the end of}} DADT on September 20, 2011, the {{same-sex}} spouses of gay {{and lesbian}} service members were not treated {{on a par with the}} different-sex spouses of military service members because of restrictions imposed by Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and certain federal <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> contain definitions of marriage that exclude same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses are denied death benefits, identification cards, base access, access to repatriation ceremonies, and other entitlements.|$|E
25|$|Lochner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} decisions in the Supreme Court's history, giving its name to what is known as the Lochner era. During this time, the Supreme Court issued several decisions invalidating federal and state <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> sought to regulate working conditions during the Progressive Era and the Great Depression. This period ended with West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish (1937), in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by the State of Washington.|$|E

25|$|The Taliban {{disagreed}} with past Afghan <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> allowed {{the employment of}} women in a mixed sex workplace. They claimed this was a breach of purdah and sharia law. On September 30, 1996, the Taliban decreed that all women should be banned from employment. It is estimated that 25 percent of government employees were female, and when compounded by losses in other sectors, many thousands of women were affected. This had a devastating impact on household incomes, especially on vulnerable or widow-headed households, which were common in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Clinton v. City of New York, , is a {{legal case}} in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the line-item veto as granted in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 {{violated}} the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly gave the President of the United States the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> had been duly passed by the United States Congress. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, Attorney General Eric Holder, as {{required}} by law, notified Speaker of the House John Boehner that the Obama administration had determined {{that it should not}} enforce the federal <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> define spouse in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited Windsor and the decision in Cooper-Harris the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.|$|E

25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} public employee constitutes, or should be treated as, the government’s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a public employee is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}’s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set of state and federal <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted that speech that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., the teacher in Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the federal regulations under 21 CFR Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA’s standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own <b>statutes</b> <b>that</b> serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut’s law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain grain products, including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.|$|E
