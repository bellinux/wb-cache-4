50|$|The second {{option for}} the Jones could be to impose a cost on the Smith family {{if they want to}} {{continue}} to get utility from their <b>pear</b> <b>trees.</b> Say, if the Jones family has a MC of $25 for each <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> produced, it allows them to plant 3 <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> a year (Jones’ MB = MC). However, if the cost is imposed on the Smiths, the optimal quantity of <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> produced a year will increase to 4 (Jones’ MB + Smiths’ MB = MC). By internalizing the externality, both the Smith family and the Jones family increase their overall utility by increasing production from 3 <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> a year to 4. It should be noted that $5 is the maximum price the Smiths {{are willing to pay for}} an additional, fourth, <b>pear</b> <b>tree,</b> which implies their marginal benefit to plant a fifth <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> is 0.|$|R

50|$|Janie's {{image of}} the <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> causes her to imagine that {{marriage}} must involve love—in Janie's <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> scene, she sees bees pollinating a <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> and believes that marriage is the human equivalent to this natural process. However, Killicks wants a domestic helper rather than a lover or partner; he thinks Janie does not do enough around the farm and that she is ungrateful. Janie speaks to Nanny about how she feels, but Nanny, too, accuses her of being spoiled. And so, Janie's idea of the <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> is tarnished. Soon afterward, Nanny dies.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> {{has also}} been {{described}} as phallic in nature and referring to Harry himself; {{at one point the}} <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> is said to be growing towards the moon, the moon having been compared to Pearl at an earlier point in the story.

50|$|Xanthocryptus novozealandicus, {{the lemon}} <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> parasite, is a wasp {{in the family}} Ichneumonidae. It is a native insect of New Zealand. It {{is also found in}} Australia and New Guinea. Females hunt for larvae of wood-boring beetles around March, {{including}} the lemon <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> (Oemona hirta), a native cerambycid that tunnels into citrus trees, grapes and many native species. When a suitable host is found, the female pushes her ovipositor through the wood and injects her eggs into the grub. This has the incidental benefit of helping to control some pests. X. novozealandicus prefers to prey on second year lemon <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> larvae.|$|R

50|$|The Jones family plants <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> {{on their}} {{property}} which is adjacent to the Smith family. The Smith family gets an external benefit from the Jones family’s <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> because they pick up whatever pears {{fall to the ground}} on their side of the property line. This is an externality because the Smith family does not pay the Jones family for utility received from gathering the fallen pears and, therefore, does not participate in the market transaction of pear production. It results in the pears being underproduced, which means too few <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> are planted.|$|R
