25|$|The BMD-4M was {{unveiled}} by Kurganmashzavod in 2008. This vehicle retains the Bakhcha-U turret {{with a number}} of other innovations. Overall bulletproof crew protection is ensured. Special lightweight and durable alloys make this possible without the vehicle losing its ability to swim or be airdropped. The more powerful and compact engine of the BMP-3 is integrated into the BMD-4M; providing 500hp. In general, the unification of units, plants, and systems of the modernized BMD-4 chassis with the same units, plants and systems of BMP-3 is 80%. This decreases the expenses of the airborne assault vehicle servicing in the army allowing a significant reduction of <b>service</b> <b>maintenance</b> of airborne combat vehicles in the army.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next major}} {{expansion}} to the Capitol started in 1958, with a [...] {{extension of the}} East Portico. During this project, in 1960 the dome underwent a restoration. A marble duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built [...] from the old Front. (In 1962, a connecting extension incorporated what had been an outside wall as an inside wall.) In the process, the Corinthian columns were removed. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer Russell Page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U.S. National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol Columns, where they are combined with a reflecting pool in an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis, in Persia. Besides the columns, hundreds of blocks of the original stone were removed and are stored behind a National Park <b>Service</b> <b>maintenance</b> yard in Rock Creek Park.|$|E
