Objects lying on the tram track get hit by a <b>sensor</b> <b>bracket,</b> which {{triggers}} the lowering of a basket shaped device to the ground preventing overrunning of the obstacles by dragging it along the road surface in front of the wheels.|$|E
40|$|People {{with limited}} {{movement}} caused by cervical or brain problems are limited {{on the use}} of a computer because of the difficulty in moving their arms. The solution presented in this paper aims to provide accessibility for these people so that they can communicate using a computer at a low cost and with minimal intrusion possible. Thus, a computer vision system was developed from the application of the techniques Viola and Jones (AdaBoost) and Hough-Circles, capable of performing functions of a mouse and a virtual keyboard by detecting eye movements and eyelids of the user. With the proposed system, a person with physical limitations is able to use simple functions of a computer just moving the eyes and eyelids, without using <b>sensors,</b> <b>brackets</b> or markers that could be intrusive and raise the cost of the solution...|$|R
40|$|This book brings {{together}} investigations which combine theoretical and experimental results related to such systems as capsule micromechanisms, active micro catheters, nanotube vascular stents, mechanisms for micromilling, different compliant mechanisms including grippers and compliant systems with actuators and sensors, microrobots based on vibrations, tactile <b>sensors,</b> tooth <b>brackets,</b> compliant valves, and space reflectors. This volume contains twenty-two contributions from researchers from ten countries, represented at the 4 th Conference on Microactuators and Micromechanisms, {{which was held}} in 2016 in Ilmenau, Germany. The aim of the conference {{was to provide a}} special opportunity for a know-how exchange and collaboration in various disciplines concerning systems pertaining to micro-technology. This Conference was organized under the patronage of IFToMM (International Federation for the Promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science). ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives] This paper aims {{to solve}} the {{problems}} of the high subjectivity and low accuracy and efficiency of draft surveying relying on human visual inspection. [Methods] Radar-level oil and liquid measurement technology products are widely used in the petrochemical industry. A device is developed that uses radar to survey the draft of a boat, designed with data series optimization formulae to ensure that the data results are true and correct. At the same time, a test is designed to prove the accuracy of the results. [Results] According to the conditions of the ship,the device is composed of a radar <b>sensor,</b> triangular <b>bracket</b> and display,and is put to use in the test. [Conclusions] With 15 vessels as the research objects,the comparison experiment shows a difference in range between 0. 001 - 0. 022 meters, with an average difference rate of 0. 028 %, which meets the requirements for ship draft survey accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{describes}} a low-cost, portable and flexible Sensor Configuration Unit (SCU) design {{for use in}} engineering measurements with various sensors. The unit consists of a sturdy ring stand, a plate with holes to hold various <b>sensors,</b> and a <b>bracket</b> fastened to the plate to hold the signal conditioning unit of the sensors and provide the input output connections. This puts the sensor to be used and its signal conditioning unit into a single central unit. The output from the sensor {{is connected to the}} measurements hardware and, more preferably, the computer data acquisition hardware, through the BNC connectors on the bracket. The set-up is very portable and has a minimal footprint on the experiment workbench. It eliminates the problems of many wires scattered around the workbench during experiments. The exchange of different sensors in the unit is easily carried out and enables purchasing standalone sensors for different engineering measurements applications for existing measurement hardware, instead of buying much more expensive all-in-one measurement units. This set-up is especially useful to an undergraduate measurement and instrumentation class in small size engineering programmes with limited budgets...|$|R
30|$|Second {{group is}} made of a linear-response sensors, such as a Dual-pixel sensor and a Linear <b>sensor</b> using {{exposure}} <b>bracketing.</b> Dual-pixel <b>sensor</b> {{is made of}} two interlaced arrays of pixels with different responsiveness (high and low). It produces two images acquired at the same time, which are then combined in a higher-dynamic-range image. In some cases a single sensitive element has two (or more) storage nodes to store the multiple images. Linear pixel and exposure bracketing is a standard approach in which two (or more) images with different exposure (integration time) of the sensor are taken after each other and afterwards merged. In video applications, there are two general possibilities for this action. If we can sacrifice the frame rate and halve it, then we can consecutively take long-exposure image in odd frames and short-exposure image during the even frames (or the other way around). Otherwise, to keep the frame rate, {{we have to take}} two images after each other during the same frame. To prevent disturbances, long-exposure image has to be obtained during the active video period, and short-exposure image should be recorded during the vertical blanking period. (Some new CMOS sensor architectures allow taking the short-exposure image during the active video period, which can reduce image blur.) This immediately poses a restriction on the duration of the short exposure image, which has to be obtained {{before the end of the}} frame.|$|R
40|$|A {{steerable}} low-noise {{source of}} illumination is described for shadow-sensors having a displacement sensitivity of ∼ 100 pm (rms) /√Hz, at 500 Hz, over a measuring span {{of at least}} ± 0. 5 mm. These sensors were designed to detect lateral "Violin-Mode" resonances in the highly tensioned fused-silica suspension fibres of the test-masses/mirrors for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory gravitational wave detectors. The shadow sensors—one intended {{for each of the}} four fibres in a suspension—comprised a source of Near InfraRed (NIR) radiation (emitter) and a differential shadow-displacement <b>sensor</b> (detector), these <b>bracketing</b> the fibre under test. The suspension fibres themselves were approximately 600 mm long by 0. 4 mm in diameter, and when illuminated from the side, they cast narrow, vertical, shadows onto their respective detectors—these being located at an effective distance of 50 fibre diameters behind the axes of the fibres themselves. The emitter described here was designed to compensate for a significant degree of mechanical drift or creep over time in the mean position of its suspension fibre. This was achieved by employing five adjacent columns of 8 × miniature NIR LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes, λ = 890 nm), with one column being activated at a time. When used in conjunction with a "reverse Galilean" telescope, the LED sources allowed the collimated beam from the emitter to be steered azimuthally in fine angular increments (0. 65 ◦), causing the fibre's shadow to move laterally, in a step-wise manner, across the plane of its facing detector. Each step in shadow position was approximately 0. 23 mm in size, and this allowed the fibre's shadow to be re-centred, so as to bridge once again both elements of its photodiode detector—even if the fibre was off-centred by as much as ± 0. 5 mm. Re-centring allowed Violin-Mode vibrations of the fibre to be sensed once again as differential AC photocurrents, these flowing in anti-phase in the two elements of the "split-photodiode" detector.
