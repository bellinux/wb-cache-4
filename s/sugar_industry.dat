5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian <b>sugar</b> <b>industry</b> was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the <b>sugar</b> <b>industry</b> was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Castro's {{government}} diversified {{its economy}} into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's <b>sugar</b> <b>industry</b> as its {{primary source of}} revenue in 1995. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both {{in the form of}} Roman Catholicism and Santería. Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious institutions and religious people were permitted {{for the first time to}} join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic <b>sugar</b> <b>industry,</b> and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E

The study was conducted in North Karnataka during the year 2008. This area was selected because more than 50 per cent of sugar factories are situated in north Karnataka and more sugar factories are situated in Bagalkot and Belgaum districts. From the study it was inferred that agricultural graduates had more communication efficiency as compared to non-agricultural graduates working in the private sugar factories and the agricultural graduates had more job satisfaction and job commitment in private sugar factories. Communication efficiency was highest in non-agricultural graduates in private <b>sugar</b> <b>industries</b> and lowest in agricultural graduates in cooperative industries. Agricultural graduates in private <b>sugar</b> <b>industries</b> had highest job satisfaction and agricultural graduates in cooperative <b>sugar</b> <b>industries.</b> While talking of job commitment non-agricultural graduates in private <b>sugar</b> <b>industries</b> had highest level of job commitment which was lowest in non-agricultural graduates in cooperative <b>sugar</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R

5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the <b>sugar</b> <b>industry</b> in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|Alma caused {{significant}} {{crop damage}} in western Cuba; it destroyed 13,400acres (5,400hectares) of bananas and 18,090acres (7,320hectares) of corn fields. There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>industry,</b> after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and supply shortages.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War, {{which gave}} Cuba its {{independence}} from Spain, many anarchists were dissatisfied with the conditions that persisted after independence. They cited conditions that were perpetuated by the new government, like suppression of labor movements, US occupations, and dissatisfaction with the school systems. By 1899, anarchist workers had reorganized themselves, under the Alianza de Trabajadores (Worker's Alliance). By September of this year, five of the groups organizers had been arrested, following a mason's strike which spread {{to all of the}} construction trade. Around this time, anarchist organizer Errico Malatesta visited Cuba, giving speeches, and interviews to several periodicals, but was soon barred from further speaking engagements by civil governor Emilio Nuñez. Around 1902-03, anarchists and other labor organizers began to attempt to organize the <b>sugar</b> <b>industry,</b> then the largest industry in Cuba.

5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, {{the peaks}} of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former <b>sugar</b> <b>industry,</b> at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton and pineapple farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the <b>sugar</b> <b>industry,</b> already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively. Winds uprooted large swaths of forest, with $1million in damage at government-owned forests alone.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, the Regiment {{departed}} California {{aboard the}} USS General John Pope for Oro Bay, New Guinea. On {{the way to}} New Guinea the Regiment spent part of June in Australia. Upon arriving at Oro Bay, it {{was assigned to the}} 31st Infantry Division, 8th Army to provide area security and continue training. Some soldiers were then assigned to the Alamo Scouts, the 5217th Reconnaissance Battalion, and to the Philippine Regional Section of Allied Intelligence Bureau. One example was Second Lieutenant Rafael Ileto, a future Vice Chief of Staff in the Philippines, who led a team in the Alamo Scouts. Due to the reassignment of these soldiers, both Filipino Infantry Regiments became smaller than authorized. In response, the 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiment was disbanded and used to bring the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment to 125% of its standard allocated size. The remaining soldiers of the 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiment who did not join the Regiment formed the 2nd Filipino Infantry Battalion (Separate). During its time at Oro Bay the Regiment was reinforced with Filipinos from Hawaii.
