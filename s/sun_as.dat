5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the <b>Sun.</b> <b>As</b> Jupiter came toward the inner Solar System, in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing {{a series of}} collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.|$|E
5|$|The city {{averaged}} a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007–09, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural {{center of the}} Valley of the <b>Sun,</b> <b>as</b> well as the entire state.|$|E
5|$|The star's {{magnitude}} as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies {{that the}} body is not visible with the naked eye, but can be seen with a telescope.

5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the <b>Sun.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the <b>Sun,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as its}} orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E

Sun Xiu also enfeoffed Sun De and <b>Sun</b> Qian <b>as</b> the Marquis of Qiantang (錢唐侯) and Marquis of Yong'an (永安侯) respectively, and appointed <b>Sun</b> Jun <b>as</b> a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉).

5|$|Galaxies are {{categorized}} {{according to}} their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies {{are thought to have}} black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the <b>Sun.</b> <b>As</b> of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> a source of energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide {{has been identified as}} a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Pallas has unusual dynamic {{parameters}} {{for such a}} large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> {{the central part of}} the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84°, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β,λ) = (30°,−16°) with a 5° uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.|$|E

5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the <b>Sun,</b> <b>as</b> well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and {{the planets}} are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive {{only when the}} Sun {{illuminates}} them. The former masters regarded the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
50|$|On February 19, 2015, Salmons {{was traded}} to the Phoenix <b>Suns</b> <b>as</b> a part of a three-team deal that also {{involved}} the Miami Heat. He was subsequently waived by the Suns two days later alongside former Suns player Kendall Marshall.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in late October and early November 2007, {{primarily}} {{on the island of}} Oahu, where Lost is filmed. Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His arrest prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. With the revelation of <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E
5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained {{immersed in a}} disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the <b>Sun</b> <b>as</b> seen from the Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E
