A stakeholder search system was created to solve instances of the package delivery problem.

We propose a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling based on a user’s personal search history. We propose several context-sensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the personal search history with the current query for better ranking of documents. Using these techniques, we have developed an intelligent client-side web <b>search</b> <b>agent,</b> i. e., the UCAIR <b>search</b> <b>agent,</b> which can automatically capture a user’s personal search history, store it on the local disk, and exploit it to provide personalized search...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Developers {{work in the}} IDE, but search online {{resources}} in the web browser. The separation of the working and search context often cause the ignorance of the working context during online search. Several tools have been proposed to integrate the web browser into the IDE so that developers can search and use online resources directly in the IDE. These tools enable only the shallow integration of the web browser and the IDE. Some tools allow the developer to augment search queries with program entities in the current snapshot of the code. In this paper, we present an in-IDE ambient <b>search</b> <b>agent</b> to bridge {{the separation of the}} developer’s working context and search context. Our approach considers the developers ’ working context in the IDE as a time-series stream of programming event observed from the developer’s interaction with the IDE over time. It supports the deeper integration of the working context in the entire search process from query formulation, custom search, to search results refinement and representation. We have implemented our ambient <b>search</b> <b>agent</b> and integrate it into the Eclipse IDE. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and the tool support. Our evaluation shows that our ambient <b>search</b> <b>agent</b> can better aid developers in searching and using online programming resources while working in the IDE...|$|E

A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval performance.

In this paper, we study how to infer a user's interest from the user's search context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized search. We present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling in information retrieval.
