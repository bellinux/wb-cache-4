He has discovered a range of factors that can lengthen life in the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and he applies these findings to studies in human cells in culture. Much evidence points to stress contributing to a breakdown {{in the ability to}} maintain optimal molecular stability resulting in aging and disease. Certain life-extending agents help C. elegans respond to lifelong stress by remodeling the natural stress fighting cellular mechanisms, the Lithgow lab has found. For example, long-lived mutants of C. elegans can are very <b>stress</b> <b>resistant</b> as a result of elevated levels of [...] "heat shock proteins". Heat shock proteins promote longevity probably by preventing a loss of protein balance. Long-lived mutant strains are also resistant to heavy metals, so the Lithgow lab went on to study the relationship between longevity and [...] "metallostasis." [...] The Lithgow lab has discovered that certain cell proteins capable of extending life can also be closely involved in disease prevention. But when proteins play such dual roles, they may sometimes make tradeoffs that affect the fate of the organism. Lithgow is studying genetic variations in [...] "checkpoint proteins’’ that may create a trade-off between the rate of aging and incidence of cancer. The Lithgow lab has made seminal discoveries in the use of pharmacological agents to intervene in aging processes, such as antioxidants that protect cells against damage from unstable chemicals called free radicals. More recently, his lab have uncovered compounds that act as [...] "stress response mimetics" [...] that maintain protein balance and stability. These compounds suppress pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The lab continues to undertake screens for chemical compounds that slow aging and extend healthspan.|$|E

40|$|In {{the outlet}} of the Raba River to the Vistula, the biggest river in Poland, the {{morphology}} and morphodynamics {{of sand and}} fine-gravel subaquatic dunes were investigated. The site is situated in highland region just about the entrance to Polish Carpathians. The dunes formed on the Raba River bed estuary are composed of sand and fine gravel (d 50 up to 11 mm). Systematic observation (within the 2000 - 2005) were made of geometry, sediment composition and hydraulic climate under which the dunes grew and decomposed. The investigation focuses here mostly on the geometrical parameters of these bed forms such as height, length, as well as granulometric characteristics of the sediment. Based on in-site measurements different hydraulic parameters were calculated such as shear <b>stresses,</b> <b>resistant</b> coefficient, Froude and Reynolds numbers and roughness coefficient. It {{was found that the}} relation between height (H) and length (L) of the Raba estuary dunes describes the formula: H = 0. 05 L 0. 35. Also these dunes are steeper and flatter then classical H/L index is: H/L = 0. 0518 L 0. 622. During the field campaign, when the foot access to the estuary was possible and dunes were spotted on the river bed the range of measured water velocity was from v = 0. 39 m∙s - 1 to v = 0. 81 m∙s - 1 with the highest velocity over the dune crest. At the same time the measured range of shear stresses within the dune field formation were from t = 0. 115 N×m - 2 to t = 1. 59 N×m - 2. On the field investigations the CCHE 2 D - two-dimensional unsteady flow and sediment transport model for non-equilibrium transport of non-uniform sediment mixtures – was applied.

Areas of the vasculature that experience laminar shear <b>stress</b> appear <b>resistant</b> {{to the development of}} atherosclerotic plaques, whereas those that experience low shear stress, due to complex patterns of blood flow, appear susceptible. In vitro study of the effects of chronic shear stress on the endothelium has been somewhat limited, due to the methods of modelling shear stress available, which are for the most part only suitable for culture for up to 24 hours. I have validated an orbital shaker method of modelling two flow environments seen in the vasculature, unidirectional flow and non-directional flow, with associated shear stress profiles, for chronic time periods of up to 7 days. I have shown clear differences between the two environments in terms of endothelial cell morphology and protein expression and identified many ways in which sheared cells differ from their static counterparts, in terms of morphology, protein expression, vascular mediator release and transcriptional profile. Shear stress appears to be a protective force, inhibiting expression of inflammatory mediators and significantly altering response to inflammatory stimulus.

Here, we study computationally the bistable genetic toggle switch-a small regulatory network consisting {{of a pair of}} mutual repressors-in growing and dividing bacteria. We show that as cells with an inhibited growth exhibit high stability of toggle states, cell growth and divisions lead to a dramatic increase of toggling rates. The toggling rates were found to increase with rate of cell growth, and can be up to six orders of magnitude larger for fast growing cells than for cells with the inhibited growth. The effect is caused mainly by the increase of protein and mRNA burst sizes associated with the faster growth. The observation that fast growth dramatically destabilizes toggle states implies that rapidly growing cells may vigorously explore the epigenetic landscape enabling nongenetic evolution, while cells with inhibited growth adhere to the local optima. This can be a clever population strategy that allows the slow growing (but <b>stress</b> <b>resistant)</b> cells to survive long periods of unfavorable conditions.

40|$|Photosynthetic endolithic {{algae and}} {{cyanobacteria}} {{live within the}} skeletons of many scleractinians. Under normal conditions, less than 5 % of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaches the green endolithic algae because of the absorbance of light by the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates and the carbonate skeleton. When corals bleach (loose dinoflagellate symbionts), however, the tissue of the corals become highly transparent and photosynthetic microendoliths may be exposed {{to high levels of}} both thermal and solar stress. This study explores the consequence of these combined stresses on the phototrophic endoliths inhabiting the skeleton of Montipora monasteriata, growing at Heron Island, on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Endoliths that were exposed to sun after tissue removal were by far more susceptible to thermal photoinhibition and photo-damage than endoliths under coral tissue that contained high concentrations of brown dinoflagellate symbionts. While temperature or light alone did not result in decreased photosynthetic efficiency of the endoliths, combined thermal and solar stress caused a major decrease and delayed recovery. Endoliths protected under intact tissue recovered rapidly and photoacclimated soon after exposure to elevated sea temperatures. Endoliths under naturally occurring bleached tissue of M. monasteriata colonies (bleaching event in March 2004 at Heron Island) acclimated to increased irradiance as the brown symbionts disappeared. We suggest that two major factors determine the outcome of thermal bleaching to the endolith community. The first is the microhabitat and light levels under which a coral grows, and the second is the susceptibility of the coral-dinoflagellates symbiosis to thermal <b>stress.</b> More <b>resistant</b> corals may take longer to bleach allowing endoliths time to acclimate to a new light environment.

40|$|Abstract: Stress {{responses}} {{are of particular}} importance to microorganisms, because their habitats are subjected to continual changes in temperature, osmotic pressure, and nutrients availability. Stressors (and stress factors), may be of chemical, physical, or biological nature. While stress to microorganisms is frequently caused by the surrounding environment, the growth of microbial cells on its own may also result in induction of some kinds of stress such as starvation and acidity. During production of fresh-cut produce, cumulative mild processing steps are employed, to control the growth of microorganisms. Pathogens on plant surfaces are already stressed and stress may be increased during the multiple mild processing steps, potentially leading to very hardy bacteria geared towards enhanced survival. Cross-protection can occur because the overlapping stress responses enable bacteria exposed to one <b>stress</b> to become <b>resistant</b> to another <b>stress.</b> A number of stresses {{have been shown to}} induce cross protection, including heat, cold, acid and osmotic stress.
