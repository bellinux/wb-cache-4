60|$|I {{took the}} pages <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me,</b> {{because she had}} written them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{back the}} photograph, and I {{replaced}} {{it in my}} pocket.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{the paper}} {{which she had}} taken from the lawyer's hand.|$|E
6000|$|Theo {{gives her}} husband a kiss. [...] "My dear, I {{wish they had}} tried," [...] {{she says with a}} sigh. [...] "I was afraid lest--lest Hetty should have led him, you see; and I think she hath the better head. But, from reading this, it appears that the new lady has taken command of poor Harry," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> the letter:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I bowed, {{and took}} the letter which <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me.</b> I tore it open. It {{contained}} a few lines only.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, {{she came}} out again from her bedroom, with her wet things still {{dripping}} around her. [...] "Smoke that," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> a tiny cigarette rolled round in a leaf of fresh tobacco.|$|R
60|$|Here I giggled as I {{recalled}} the gigantic figure of Dinah Shadd when <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> my shirt.|$|E
60|$|That evening, Mrs. Fosdyke indulged her sly {{sense of}} humor in a new way. <b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> an almanac.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> her opera-glass as she spoke. I {{moved to}} the front of the box to look at the audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> the {{completed}} letter with an imperial gesture of indulgence. [...] "His mind {{and my mind}} are written there. Go, boy. I pardon you. Give my letter to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Here {{are five}} gold crowns for yourself,' <b>she</b> went on, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> the money. 'They {{may help to}} make your bivouac more comfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Loose me,' <b>she</b> cried, <b>'and</b> let <b>me</b> go. For thou hast named {{what should}} not be named, and shown the sign {{that may not be}} looked at.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a letter--without {{answering}} {{and without}} taking a chair. I opened the envelope. The letter inside was written by Miserrimus Dexter. It contained these lines: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drat you, Nancy," [...] said Polly Ann to the mare, as <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> my clothes, [...] "I'd sooner {{carry the}} pack myself than {{be bothered with}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Macumazahn, I was sick, but now I am {{well and}} you are sick, for so things go round. Drink this," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a gourd of milk.|$|E
60|$|With that reply {{she opened}} the note. Her face flushed deeply while she read it--her eyes brightened with anger as <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> it to <b>me</b> to read in my turn.|$|R
6000|$|One supper-time I {{ventured to}} ask Mrs Bowater if <b>she</b> would <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> down a tall, thin, dark-green volume, whose {{appearance}} had particularly taken my fancy. A simple enough request, but surprisingly received. She stiffened {{all over and}} eyed the bookcase with a singular intensity. [...] "The books there," [...] she said, [...] "are {{what they call the}} dead past burying its dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Wha shall I say was callin’?’ she pursued; {{and when}} I {{had told her}} ‘Mr. Ducie,’ ‘I think this’ll be for you, then?’ <b>she</b> added, and <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{a letter from the}} hall table. It ran: ...|$|R
60|$|That day on {{returning}} home I found Therese {{looking out for}} me, a very unusual occurrence of late. <b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a card bearing {{the name of the}} Marquis de Villarel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neckett's children?" [...] {{said she}} in reply to my inquiry. [...] "Yes, Surely, miss. Three pair, if you please. Door right {{opposite}} the stairs." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the key across the counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd, sir, {{that the}} {{contents}} of that note should have been as you describe. It {{seemed to me that}} Miss Bassett, when <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the communication, was far from being in a happy frame of mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It's a pair o' mittens I'm {{working for}} the minister,' she says, and <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> them to <b>me.</b> Ay, I tried no to take them, but--Oh, lads, it's queer to think how saft I was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wha shall I say was callin'?" [...] she pursued: {{and when}} I {{had told her}} [...] "Mr. Ducie," [...] "I think this'll be for you, then?" [...] <b>she</b> added, and <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{a letter from the}} hall table. It ran:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>me,</b> {{across the}} {{prostrate}} {{form of the}} rheumatic Frenchman, who smiled, and murmured, [...] "Bien, bien, mes anges," [...] and she assured me that I might expect her on the morrow.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> her slip of paper; I {{took it and}} read: [...] "Sebastian {{told you}} I was Dr. Yorke-Bannerman's daughter. And you answered, 'If so, Yorke-Bannerman was innocent, and YOU are the poisoner.' Is not that correct?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The serious {{nature of}} the {{emergency}} had its effect. My mother yielded. <b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the little ivory tablets on which she was accustomed to record her engagements. [...] "Write down the name and address," [...] she said resignedly.|$|E
60|$|At length, the {{old lady}} glanced toward the door, and made some {{observations}} about its being yet a long walk to town. <b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the buttered muffins, too, as if performing a final act of hospitality; and in other fidgety ways vaguely hinted her desire that I should decamp.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said he, <b>'and</b> <b>she</b> bade <b>me</b> {{tell you}} that if you don't meet her at nine o'clock to-morrow you will never see her again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me some token," [...] I said, [...] "that I {{may have}} always {{close to me}} to ease my aching heart till we meet again, and ever after, for love's sake!" [...] Her mind seemed to leap to understanding, and with a purpose all her own. Stooping for an instant, she tore off with swift, strong fingers a {{fragment}} of her shroud. This, having kissed it, <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me,</b> whispering: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>me</b> {{again and}} left {{something}} in my palm. When they were gone and I was in the passage, I looked at it. It was a plain card and on it was hastily scribbled an address: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it would effect little or nothing, sir, sending our Miss B. notes. She {{is not in}} the proper frame of mind to {{appreciate}} them. I saw her face when <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the letter you have just read, and I assure you, sir, she is not in a malleable mood." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{returned}} to the breakfast-room her face was as much discomposed as ever. Without speaking a word <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> two sealed letters: one, a note to be left for Mr. Meeke at the parsonage; the other, a letter marked [...] "Immediate," [...] and addressed to her solicitor in London, who was also, I should add, her nearest living relative.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the list <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me,</b> and {{wondered}} what Harry, who had to visit Vancouver, would say when he found I had pledged him to ransack the dry-goods stores {{for all kinds of}} fabrics. Still, I felt I should have faced much more than my comrades' remonstrances to please Grace Carrington then, as she stood beside me, glorified as it were by the garish sunset.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you talk}} like a wise man," [...] she laughed; then, holding my <b>hand,</b> <b>she</b> led <b>me</b> {{to the tree}} and sat down by my side on the poncho.|$|R
6000|$|She {{opened a}} drawer, {{and took out}} several others. [...] "See here," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> one; [...] "THESE are the needles I keep in {{antiseptic}} wool--the needles with which I always supply the Professor. You observe their shape--the common surgical patterns. Now, look at THIS needle, with which the Professor {{was just going to}} prick my finger! You can see for yourself at once it is of bluer steel and of a different manufacture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] added her sister. [...] "Come, {{you must}} be obedient." [...] And still holding my <b>hand</b> <b>she</b> made <b>me</b> rise, and led me into the inner room.|$|R
