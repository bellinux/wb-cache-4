5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} on spatial memory and wayfinding {{in an article}} by Ishikawa et al. in 2008 revealed that using a GPS moving map device reduces an individual's navigation abilities {{when compared to other}} participants who were using maps or had previous experience on the route with a guide. GPS moving map devices are frequently set up to allow the user to only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> detailed close-up of a particular segment of the map which is constantly updated. In comparison, maps usually allow the user to see the same view of the entire route from departure to arrival. Other research has shown that individuals who use GPS travel more slowly overall compared to map users who are faster. GPS users stop more frequently and {{for a longer period of}} time whereas map users and individuals using past experience as a guide travel on more direct routes to reach their goal.|$|E
25|$|David Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan {{made their}} way to a {{relatively}} competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2, with the match finely poised {{at the end of the}} first day. However, nineteen wickets tumbled on the second day, as Sussex took the victory one would expect from the relative table positions of the two sides. They lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan crashed to 22 for 3, only to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rebuilding effort. But a good bowling effort from Mushtaq and Rana saw Glamorgan crash from 73 for 4 to 78 for 9 as four batsmen were out for ducks. Opener David Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 in just 28 overs - Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex chased 35 to win with ease, losing only Ward in a nine-wicket victory.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1513, the Mary Rose was once more chosen by Howard as the {{flagship}} for an expedition against the French. Before seeing action, she {{took part in a}} race against other ships where she was deemed {{to be one of the}} most nimble and the fastest of the great ships in the fleet (see details under [...] "Sails and rigging"). On , Howard's force arrived off Brest only to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> enemy force join with the larger force in the safety of Brest harbour and its fortifications. The French had recently been reinforced by a force of galleys from the Mediterranean, which sank one English ship and seriously damaged another. Howard landed forces near Brest, but made no headway against the town and was by now getting low on supplies. Attempting to force a victory, he took a small force of small oared vessels on a daring frontal attack on the French galleys on [...] Howard himself managed to reach the ship of French admiral, Prégent de Bidoux, and led a small party to board it. The French fought back fiercely and cut the cables that attached the two ships, separating Howard from his men. It left him at the mercy of the soldiers aboard the galley, who instantly killed him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Taylor {{report on the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal's most passionate supporters, was demolished {{at the end of}} the 1991–92 season. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified. Populous (then LOBB Partnership) designed all-seater two-tier North Bank Stand, the last area of Highbury to be refurbished, which was opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million amid strong opposition from local residents. The new North Bank Stand contained a museum and a concourse with video arcades, bars, confectionery counters, souvenir shops and fast-food stands. [...] While the all-seater North Bank was [...] "never the same as the old-fashioned Archibald Leitch stand" [...] that it replaced, it was [...] "much more like the future of Arsenal than the past" [...] with its added amenities and [...] "Gone were the days of pushing a petrified child through a packed crowd and placing them on a barrier from which they could only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> section of the pitch". The old stand had received a fitting send off with a 5–1 defeat of Southampton, though the new stand had a less auspicious start, the first game being a surprise 0–3 defeat to Coventry City with all 3 goals coming from striker Micky Quinn. The first victory came 10 days later against Leeds United.|$|E

Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> one, but none finds any serious damage. ... High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world’s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gamma-ray burst {{emission}} {{is believed}} to be released in jets, not spherical shells. Initially the two scenarios are equivalent: the center of the jet is not [...] "aware" [...] of the jet edge, and due to relativistic beaming we only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> fraction of the jet. However, as the jet slows down, two things eventually occur (each at about the same time): First, information {{from the edge of the}} jet that there is no pressure to the side propagates to its center, and the jet matter can spread laterally. Second, relativistic beaming effects subside, and once Earth observers see the entire jet the widening of the relativistic beam is no longer compensated by the fact that we see a larger emitting region. Once these effects appear the jet fades very rapidly, an effect that is visible as a power-law [...] "break" [...] in the afterglow light curve. This is the so-called [...] "jet break" [...] that has been seen in some events and is often cited as evidence for the consensus view of GRBs as jets. Many GRB afterglows do not display jet breaks, especially in the X-ray, but they are more common in the optical light curves. Though as jet breaks generally occur at very late times (~1 day or more) when the afterglow is quite faint, and often undetectable, this is not necessarily surprising.|$|E
