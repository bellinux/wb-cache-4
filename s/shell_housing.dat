The product consists of a thick chocolate <b>shell,</b> <b>housing</b> a white and orange fondant filling which mimics the albumen and yolk of a chicken egg. The Creme Eggs are the best selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6m in sales.|$|E

An FODA with a high sensitivity of 82 rad/ g and a resonance frequency of 360 Hz is designed and tested. In this system, the minimum measurable demodulation phase of the phase-generated carrier (PGC) is 10 (- 5) rad, and the minimum acceleration reaches 120 ng theoretically. This kind of FODA, with its high responsivity, all-optic-fibre configuration, small size, light weight and stiff <b>shell</b> <b>housing,</b> ensures effective performance in practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{revolving}} vane (RV) compressor is {{a relatively}} new rotary compressor design and many of its performance characteristics would have to be evaluated. Vibration of compressors is one of these aspects and this paper presents the theoretical analysis for the vibration characteristics of the RV compressor. The analysis is done by dividing the compressor into two components – the rotational vibration of the cylinder-rotor assembly, and the resulting torsional twist of the stationary <b>shell</b> <b>housing.</b> The unique approach of using Lagrange’s equations to formulate the equation of motion for the complex cylinder-rotor assembly is presented here, along with preliminary simulated results...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} part of a larger body of ongoing {{research}} and publication investigating how current shifts in the material relations of money, commodities, and social abstractions shape processes of contemporary subject formation. By moving dialectically through today's landscape of social abstraction, we analyze subject positions under postcrisis conditions starting with that of the entrepreneur, trying to better understand the social and political possibilities foreclosed by contemporary subjectivity. If the contemporary subject is a derelict <b>shell</b> <b>housing</b> data bodies, social commodities, and quantified selves, we need to develop another materialist understanding of the subject that looks to the collective production of affects and rationalities in resistance, which both exhibit and forecast the surpassing of the symptoms of our present...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{wind speed}} and {{direction}} sensor {{designed for the}} atmosphere of Mars is described. It {{is based on a}} spherical shell divided into four triangular sectors according to the central projection of tetrahedron onto the surface of the unit sphere. Each sector is individually controlled to be heated above the ambient temperature independently of the wind velocity and incidence angle. A convection heat rate model of four hot spherical triangles under forced wind has been built with finite element method thermal-fluidic simulations. The angular sensitivity of the tetrahedral sphere structure has been theoretically determined and compared with the tessellation of the sphere by four biangles. A 9 -mm-diameter prototype has been assembled using 3 -D printing of the spherical <b>shell</b> <b>housing</b> in the interior commercial platinum resistors connected to an extension of a custom design printed board. Measurements in Martianlike atmosphere demonstrate sensor responsiveness to the flow in the velocity range 1 – 13 m/s at 10 -mBar CO 2 pressure. Numerical modelization of the sensor behavior allows to devise an inverse algorithm to retrieve the wind direction data from the raw measurements of the power delivered to each spherical sector. The functionality of the inverse algorithm is also demonstrated. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E

40|$|Radioactive {{materials}} are transported in hollow steel casks filled with lead. The lead in these casks can melt in an accidental fire during transportation {{leading to an}} increase in its volume. This plastically deforms the steel <b>shell</b> <b>housing</b> the lead. When the cask subsequently cools after the fire is extinguished, voids will form in the solidified lead. This work deals with the simulation of solidification with void formation in these transportation casks. In these simulations, one has to deal with solid-liquid and void-material interfaces. Solid-liquid movement during solidification is treated using a modified enthalpy method. The void that is formed in the solidified lead is assumed to be a vacuum. Consistent with this assumption, the boundary conditions of zero pressure and zero stress are imposed on the interface. The growth of the void is handled using the volume of fluid method. The methodology is first benchmarked by comparing the simulations with some experimental results available in the literature. Simulations are then performed for solidification in the transportation cask to study the effect of orientation on the void formation. A methodology is then developed to quantify the overall shielding effectiveness of the cask in terms of the total amount of radiation leaked...|$|E
