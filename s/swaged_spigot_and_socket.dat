50|$|<b>Spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the <b>socket.</b> Normal <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> {{cast iron}} pipes were jointed by filling the socket {{with a mixture}} of water, sand, iron filings and sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride.) A gasket ring was pushed into the socket round the spigot to contain the mixture which was pounded into the socket with a caulking tool and then pointed off. This took several weeks to set and produced a completely rigid joint. Such pipe systems are often to be seen in nineteenth century churches in the heating system.|$|R
50|$|Simpson {{was born}} in Blackwell, Carlisle and began his career in 1778 as a {{millwright}} until being appointed an inspector and engineer of the Chelsea Waterworks. He later also became an engineer at Lambeth Waterworks Company. He contributed {{to the introduction of}} iron fresh water pipes and replacement of wooden mains in London and throughout the United Kingdom, testifying before a Parliamentary select committee in 1821 that he had invented a method of making <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints watertight by filling them with hemp or flax and then covering them in lead. He also built a workshop to repair and maintain steam engines in 1785, which his son James Simpson took over and developed into James Simpson and Co. Ltd, later Worthington-Simpson Ltd, which after several further mergers currently trades as Flowserve.|$|R

50|$|The {{most widely}} used version of the spigot gun was the tree spigot gun. This had its spigot mounted on a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joint {{attached}} to a large wood screw. A pair of handles were provided to turn the screw {{so that it could}} be secured in a tree or other suitable wooden support; one of the handles had a chisel-shaped end for removing bark from trees. When this had been done, a sighting tool could be placed on the <b>spigot,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>spigot</b> was then adjusted and clamped into position. The sight was then removed and replaced with the mortar projectile. The weapon was fired by pulling on a lanyard, by a trip wire as part of a booby trap or by a pencil detonator delay mechanism. The tree spigot had a range of 200 yd. As part of a booby trap, it could be positioned to fire downwards onto the relatively thin armour on top of a tank. One account of its use describes a trip wire for a locomotive; placed up high it was likely to be missed by track walkers looking for bombs on the railway line.|$|R

50|$|One {{problem with}} the stump <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> {{attachment}} is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the stump <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> or liner, <b>and</b> increase pockets between stump skin <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes.
