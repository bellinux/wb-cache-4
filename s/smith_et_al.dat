5|$|Since {{the growth}} of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually {{been found to be}} a coelurosaurian of {{uncertain}} affinities, not fitting with the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements around the base of Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have not since found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis of Turner et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable.|$|E

25|$|<b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2001, p.958) {{assessed}} {{the literature on}} the aggregate impacts of climate change. With medium confidence, they concluded that a small increase in global average temperature (up to 2°C, measured against 1990 levels) would result in an aggregate market sector impact of plus or minus a few percent of world GDP. <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2001) found that for a small to medium (2-3°C) global average temperature increase, some studies predicted small net positive market impacts. Most studies they assessed predicted net damages beyond a medium temperature increase, with further damages for greater (more than 3°C) temperature rises.|$|E

It is a questionnaire consisting of 16 items; in which participants rank how often memory failure occurs using a 5-point scale (Very Often, Quite Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never). The PRMQ equally assesses three variables: prospective and retrospective memory, short-term memory and long-term memory, and self-cued and environmentally-cued memory.|$|E
25|$|Aggregating impacts adds up {{the total}} impact {{of climate change}} across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007a, p.76).

It is also necessary for the researcher to make subjective value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different economic sectors, in different regions, and at different times.|$|E

25|$|Feature models view {{semantic}} categories {{as being}} composed of relatively unstructured sets of features. The semantic feature-comparison model, proposed by Smith, Shoben, and Rips (1974), describes memory as being composed of feature lists for different concepts. According to this view, {{the relations between}} categories would not be directly retrieved, they would be indirectly computed. For example, subjects might verify a sentence by comparing the feature sets that represent its subject and predicate concepts. Such computational feature-comparison models include the ones proposed by Meyer (1970), Rips (1975), <b>Smith,</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1974).|$|E
25|$|A second {{approach}} has been suggested based on economics and the social welfare function. To calculate the social welfare function requires an aggregation of the impacts of climate change policies and climate change itself across all affected individuals. This calculation involves a number of complexities and controversial equity issues (Markandya et al., 2001:460). For example, the monetization of certain impacts on human health. There is also controversy {{over the issue of}} benefits affecting one individual offsetting negative impacts on another (<b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al..,</b> 2001:958). These issues to do with equity and aggregation cannot be fully resolved by economics (Banuri et al.., 1996:87).|$|E
25|$|Not enough {{genetic and}} {{morphological}} diversity exists between C. exsul from Cedros Island and C. ruber {{from the mainland}} to warrant the recognition of both species. Since C. exsul Garman (1884) has priority over C. ruber Cope (1892), they suggested the island population {{be referred to as}} C. e. exsul and those from the mainland as C. e. ruber. In response, <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (1998) petitioned the ICZN to validate ruber over exsul in the interest of nomenclatural stability. In 2000, the ICZN published Opinion 1960 in which they ruled C. ruber should have precedence over C. exsul.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> {{expanded}} {{on these}} results by barcoding 2,134 flies belonging to {{what appeared to}} be the 16 most generalist of the ACG tachinid morphospecies. They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated by an average of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported by collateral ecological information, and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{increasing}} amount {{of research on the}} effect of age on prospective memory where typical studies compare groups of people from different ages. A study by <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2010) comparing event-based prospective memory in schoolchildren (7–10 years old) and young adults found that adults had better memory performance. Another study by Kvavilashvili et al. (2009) comparing time-based prospective memory among young adults (18- to 30-year-olds), young-old adults (60- to 75-year-olds) and old-old adults (76- to 90-year-olds) showed that young adults had better performance. Event-based prospective memory was further compared between young-old and old-old adults and findings were that young-old adults performed better than old-old adults. These studies suggested that there is continual improvement of prospective memory from childhood into young adulthood but that a decline begins in late adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Coals {{are from}} type III kerogen mostly derived from {{terrestrial}} plants, {{which should have}} a primary D/H signal sensitive to local meteoric water. Reddings et al. analyzed coals from various origins and found them randomly scatter across the range of -90‰ to -170‰. Rigby et al. found D contents decrease from -70‰ to -100‰ with increasing maturity in coal from Bass Basin and attributed this to latter exchange with low D water. <b>Smith</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> studied H isotopes of coal samples from Antarctica and Australia. They found a strong negative correlation between δD and inferred paleolatitude. For coal samples originating from near equatorial regions, δD is around -50‰, while for those originating from polar regions, δD is around -150‰. This δD trend along latitude is consistent meteoric water trend and thus is an evidence that coals can preserve much of the original signals.|$|E
