30|$|To {{improve the}} drying method in the {{manufacture}} of woodwind reeds, green canes (Arundo donax L.) were dried under various humidity–temperature conditions and the intensity of cell collapse was evaluated from the swelling due to steaming during the recovery of collapse. At 30 °C, the intensity of collapse was increased by <b>slower</b> <b>drying.</b> It was considered that: (1) <b>slower</b> <b>drying</b> resulted in higher sample temperature in the early stage of drying and acted to increase the collapse; (2) rapid drying stiffened the surface of the sample and such a “shell” prohibited the following collapse; (3) <b>slower</b> <b>drying</b> i.e., longer loading of liquid tension caused more remarkable and/or frequent viscoelastic yields of cells. Consequently, the intensity of collapse increased when the cane was dried from its waxy outer surface or in the presence of node: both of them retarded drying. On the other hand, higher drying temperature caused greater intensity of collapse in spite of faster drying. It was suggested that the thermal softening of cane cells leads to easier yielding of the cell wall, {{and at the same time}} the rapid drying does not allow the recovery of collapse after the disappearance of free water. These results indicated that faster drying at lower temperature is preferable for drying cane with less collapse.|$|R

5000|$|Application: Sansodor is {{a highly}} refined odorless mineral spirit {{that is used to}} dilute (thin) artists' oil paints and is also used to dilute oil media (linseed oils, alkyd media, etc.). To conform to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule in oil painting, Sansodor should be {{considered}} a [...] "lean" [...] medium (although, technically it is a thinner) and, therefore, used mostly in the initial layers of a painting. The addition of [...] "fat" [...] media like alkyd (faster <b>drying)</b> and linseed (<b>slower</b> <b>drying)</b> are progressively added into the subsequent layers of the painting in conformance to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule.

Although Sansodor can be used to reduce the viscosity of these media (thick media like stand oil and alkyds) to increase their flow, it should never exceed 50% of any oil paint medium mixture to ensure proper pigment bonding.|$|R

50|$|Lacquers using acrylic resin, a {{synthetic}} polymer, {{were developed in}} the 1950s. Acrylic resin is colourless, transparent thermoplastic, obtained by the polymerization of derivatives of acrylic acid. Acrylic is also used in enamel paints, which {{have the advantage of}} not needing to be buffed to obtain a shine. Enamels, however, are <b>slow</b> <b>drying.</b> The advantage of acrylic lacquer is its exceptionally fast drying time. The use of lacquers in automobile finishes was discontinued when tougher, more durable, weather- and chemical-resistant two-component polyurethane coatings were developed. The system usually consists of a primer, colour coat and clear topcoat, commonly known as clear coat finishes.|$|E
50|$|Only {{a proper}} acrylic gesso {{should be used}} to prime canvas in {{preparation}} for painting with acrylic paints. However, acrylic paint can be applied to a raw canvas if so desired without any negative effect or chemical reaction (the case with oil paint). It is important to avoid adding non-stable or non-archival elements to the gesso upon application. However, the viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are retarders to <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> and extend workability time, and flow releases to increase color-blending ability.|$|E

5000|$|Cotton {{is usually}} inexpensive. It absorbs {{moisture}} easily and is <b>slow</b> to <b>dry</b> out.

40|$|Organic field-effect {{transistors}} (OFETs) with water-soluble and crosslinkable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a gate insulator and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) as {{an active}} semiconductor were fabricated, and the device performances were investigated. Heat-crosslinked PVA displays better dielectric properties because it contains less water and the OFETs show enhanced on/off ratios and improved stability. P 3 HT films were fabricated by spin-coating and drop-casting methods and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and UV–visible absorption spectra. The mobilities of drop-cast P 3 HT films are one order {{higher than those of}} the spin-coated films, which is ascribed to the <b>slower</b> <b>drying</b> of the solvent and more-ordered structure in the films. However, OFETs with drop-cast P 3 HT show inferior saturation characteristics and lower on/off ratios. This is probably due to higher roughness and thickness of the drop-cast film and nonnegligible carrier transportation in the bulk, which can be demonstrated by the conductance measurements...|$|R
50|$|Although Vasa was in {{surprisingly}} good condition after 333 {{years at the}} bottom of the sea, it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of Vasa, over 600 cubic metres (21,000 cu ft) of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship Mary Rose. Vasa was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of <b>slow</b> <b>drying,</b> which is not yet entirely complete.|$|E
50|$|Acrylic {{paint is}} fast drying paint {{containing}} pigment suspension in acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending {{on how much}} the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings. This <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> aspect of oil {{can be seen as}} an advantage for certain techniques, but in other regards it impedes the artist trying to work quickly.|$|E
50|$|Due to acrylic paint's more {{flexible}} nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist {{does not have}} to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15-20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of wet-in-wet technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can <b>slow</b> <b>drying</b> time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.|$|E
5000|$|Xylene {{is used as}} a solvent. In this application, with {{a mixture}} of isomers, it is often {{referred}} to as xylenes or xylol. Solvent xylene often contains a small percentage of ethylbenzene. Like the individual isomers, the mixture is colorless, sweet-smelling, and highly flammable. Areas of application include the printing, rubber, and leather industries. It is a common component of ink, rubber, and adhesives. In thinning paints and varnishes, it can be substituted for toluene where <b>slower</b> <b>drying</b> is desired, and thus is used by conservators of art objects in solubility testing. Similarly it is a cleaning agent, e.g., for steel, silicon wafers, and integrated circuits. In dentistry, xylene can be used to dissolve gutta percha, a material used for endodontics (root canal treatments). In the petroleum industry, xylene is also a frequent component of paraffin solvents, used when the tubing becomes clogged with paraffin wax. For similar reasons, it is often the active ingredient in commercial products for ear wax (cerumen) removal.(1) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} way to realize on-chip sample preparation for point-of-care diagnostics is to store the required reagents on a microfluidic device and release them {{in a controlled manner}} upon contact with the sample. For the development of such diagnostic devices, a fundamental understanding of the release kinetics of reagents from suitable materials in microfluidic chips is therefore essential. Here, we study the release kinetics of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies from (sub-) µm thick gelatin layers and several ways to control the release time. The observed antibody release is well-described by a diffusion model. Release times ranging from ~ 20 s to ~ 650 s were determined for layers with thicknesses (in the dry state) between 0. 25 µm and 1. 5 µm, corresponding to a diffusivity of 0. 65 µm 2 /s (in the swollen state) for our standard layer preparation conditions. By modifying the preparation conditions, we can influence the properties of gelatin to realize faster or <b>slower</b> release. Faster <b>drying</b> at increased temperatures leads to shorter release times, whereas <b>slower</b> <b>drying</b> at increased humidity yields slower release. As expected in a diffusive process, the release time increases with the size of the antibody. Moreover, the ionic strength of the release medium has {{a significant impact on the}} release kinetics. Applying these findings to cell counting chambers with on-chip sample preparation, we can tune the release to control the antibody distribution after inflow of blood in order to achieve homogeneous cell staining...|$|R
