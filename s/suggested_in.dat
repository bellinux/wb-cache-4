Pluto's planetary status {{was and is}} fondly thought of by many, especially in the United States since Pluto was found by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, {{and the general public}} could have been alienated from professional astronomers; there was considerable uproar when the media last <b>suggested,</b> <b>in</b> 1999, that Pluto might be demoted, which was a misunderstanding of a proposal to catalog all trans-Neptunian objects uniformly.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that <b>suggested</b> <b>in</b> 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was <b>suggested</b> <b>in</b> the history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an}} explosion on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick <b>suggested</b> <b>in</b> 1982 {{that the}} nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been <b>suggested</b> <b>in</b> some regions.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it was larger than Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple <b>suggested</b> <b>in</b> 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status until 2006.|$|E

Charles, then 17, rode in the tourneys at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man, who enjoyed jousting and hunting and was excited to be married.|$|E

Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that fundamental constants such asc {{have the same}} value throughout spacetime, meaning {{that they do not}} depend on location and do not vary with time.
