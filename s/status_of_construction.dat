5000|$|Glücks's {{responsibilities}} {{at first}} mainly covered {{the use of}} concentration camp inmates for forced labour. In this phase, he urged camp commandants to lower the death rate in the camps, as it went counter to the economic objectives his department was to fulfill. Other orders of his were {{to ask for the}} inmates to be made to work continuously. At the same time, it was Glücks who recommended on 21 February 1940, Auschwitz, a former Austrian cavalry barracks, as a suitable site for a new concentration camp to Himmler and Heydrich. Glücks accompanied Himmler and several chief directors of I.G. Farben on 1 March 1941 for a visit to Auschwitz, where it was decided that the camp would be expanded to accommodate up to 30,000 prisoners, an additional camp would be established at nearby Birkenau capable of housing 100,000 POWs, and that a factory would be constructed in proximity with the camp prisoners placed at I.G. Farben's disposal. [...] On 20 April 1941 Glücks was promoted to the rank of an SS-Brigadeführer and in November 1943, Glücks was made SS-Gruppenführer and a Generalleutnant of the Waffen-SS. From 1942 on, Glücks was increasingly involved in the implementation of the [...] "Final Solution", along with Pohl. To oversee the coordination of camp related activities, which varied from the medical concerns of personnel and prisoners, the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> projects, and the progress of extermination operations, Glücks, along with other senior SS camp managers, attended weekly meetings conducted by Pohl. Glücks never attempted to outshine his superior and was quite aware of his subordination to Pohl.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{syntactic}} <b>status</b> <b>of</b> non-finite <b>constructions</b> in English and Albanian? Are {{they considered}} as clauses? And, what is more, when carrying temporal meaning, can we classify them as non-finite clauses <b>of</b> time? Non-finite <b>constructions,</b> which are sequences {{of words that}} lack a finite verb, have {{attracted the attention of}} English and Albanian grammarians. Due to the variety of structures and semantic relations triggered by them, non-finite constructions stand in a thin line between phrases and clauses. While many modern English grammarians treat them as clauses, Albanian grammarians give relatively controversial comments on their status. In addition to the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> non-finite <b>constructions,</b> this paper aims at identifying the major semantic relations expressed by them, analyzing examples from a corpus taken from “The Da Vinci Code ” by Dan Brown, where time clauses make up about 20. 000 words. Comparing the examples from the original text to their counterparts from the Albanian translated version will offer a new prospect on the peculiarities <b>of</b> non-finite <b>constructions</b> in time clauses...|$|R
