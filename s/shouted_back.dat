5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens {{around the edge of}} the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E
25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting a distance and bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{stepped outside}} and quietly remarked, [...] "We spend $75 {{billion a year}} on armaments and $3 {{billion a year on}} dogs. We have to do more for these {{children}} that didn't ask to be born into this." [...] Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, [...] "Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side." [...] Langford added, [...] "I don't know of anybody starving down here." [...] Kennedy responded, [...] "Step over here and I'll introduce you to some." [...] Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to [...] "find fault," [...] but rather [...] "just {{to see if we can}} do anything about it." ...|$|E

He gave an abridged {{version of his}} speech on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2007. The talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical [...] "final talk", with a topic such as [...] "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if {{you knew it was}} your last chance?" [...] Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students.

500|$|The Pike Place Fish Market is {{best known}} for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the {{shopping}} area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order, which is loudly <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping. Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition. While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish. At times, the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. Above the areas in which they throw fish, the market hangs a sign that reads, [...] "Caution: Low Flying Fish".|$|E
2500|$|A video {{distributed}} online {{showed a}} gunman firing at pedestrians outside McDonald's. He {{then moved on}} to the shopping mall itself. Another video showed the gunman walking alone on the roof of a nearby car park before opening fire again. He was heard shouting [...] "I am German" [...] (...) and [...] "I was born here" [...] (...) after an onlooker shouted anti-Turkish statements and other abuse at him. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the gunman also <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> [...] "Shit Turks". However, it is still not clear who started the anti-Turkish insults.|$|E

50|$|The {{returning}} chorus is sung in pitched notes, but {{the singers}} {{consider this a}} kakegoe.

60|$|By now Jeekie was {{shouting}} {{something to the}} natives in an unknown tongue, which they seemed to understand well enough. At any rate the flogging ceased, the two fellows who were inflicting it slunk away, and the other men ran towards them, <b>shouting</b> <b>back</b> as they came.|$|R
2500|$|At the October 1992 Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Tebbit embarrassed John Major's {{government}} {{when he made}} {{a speech}} attacking the Treaty. As he walked up onto the podium he was applauded by some sections of the audience, described as [...] "young, in t-shirts, aggressively self-confident – the lager louts of our party" [...] in the diary of the Conservative Party chairman of the time, Norman Fowler. Tebbit held aloft {{a copy of the}} Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience <b>shouted</b> <b>back</b> [...] "No!" [...] after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers. Gyles Brandreth, a Conservative whip, wrote in his diary: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kinnock {{appeared}} at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in Stoke-on-Trent on 30 November 1984 - {{the day of}} the killing of David Wilkie. [...] His speech developed into an argument with hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike. Kinnock began by saying, [...] "We meet here tonight in the shadow of an outrage." [...] When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of [...] "living like parasites off the struggle of the miners." [...] As Kinnock denounced the lack of the ballot, violence against strikebreakers and Scargill's tactical approach, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners. [...] Kinnock <b>shouted</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "Well, I was not telling them lies. [...] That's what I was not doing during that period." [...] It was a thinly-veiled attack on Scargill, whom he later admitted that he detested.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2006, {{despite the}} PRD's plans to prevent Calderón from taking office, the inauguration {{in front of}} Congress was able to proceed. Hours before Calderón's arrival, lawmakers from the PRD and PAN parties began a brawl, in which several representatives threw punches and pushed, while others shouted at each other. PRD representatives shouted [...] "Fuera Fox" [...] ("Out with President Fox") and blew whistles, while PAN representatives responded back with [...] "Mexico, Mexico". Minutes before Calderón and Fox walked into Congress, the {{president}} of the Chamber of Deputies announced a legal quorum, thus enabling Calderón to legally take the oath of office. At 9:45am CST, all Mexican media cut to the official national broadcast, where commentators discussed the situation and showed scenes inside the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies, Palacio de San Lázaro. At 9:50am CST, Calderón entered the chamber through {{the back door of the}} palace and approached the podium, where he took the oath as required by the Constitution. After the anthem, opposition continued to yell in Spanish [...] "Felipe will fall". PAN representatives <b>shouted</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "Sí se pudo" [...] (Yes, we did it!).|$|E
5000|$|In the Japanese version, {{the gang}} {{in front of}} the Devil's Hand was photographed by the camera as they pose for peace.

A man struck him and the woman got him by the beard. Then his reason left him altogether.|$|R
60|$|May 7. A bang on {{the door}} at 6. Did I want my boots cleaned? Fifteen minutes later another bang. Did we want coffee? Fifteen later, bang again, my wife's bath ready; 15 later, my bath ready.

2500|$|The {{absence of}} any other combatants had bought Serapis a {{considerable}} amount of time. Bonhomme Richard’s gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10pm, to surrender by striking the ship’s colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson <b>shouted</b> <b>back,</b> asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones’s reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting {{something along the lines of}} [...] "I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike," [...] at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who thought he heard something like [...] "I may sink, but I’ll be damned if I strike", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Toward evening a {{party of}} hangmen arrived. The {{officers}} went in and informed the condemned men {{they were to be}} executed between four and five in the morning. Their reply was to sing [...] "Hatikvah" [...] and other songs in powerful voices. They then shouted to us that the hangings would begin at four o'clock, in this order: Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss. They added: 'Avenge our blood! Avenge our blood!' We <b>shouted</b> <b>back,</b> 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. At four in the morning Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and we joined in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence near our cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again we joined in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder that we would not be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard. We declared a fast and prayed. Later in the morning we found the following inscription {{on the wall of the}} cell of the condemned: 'They will not frighten the Hebrew youth in the Homeland with their hangings. Thousands will follow in our footsteps.' Next to it was the Irgun insignia and their three names in the order they were executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink.

The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?"

[...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
