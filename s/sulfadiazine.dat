25|$|Another {{important}} cornerstone {{in treating}} rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low-dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, <b>sulfadiazine,</b> or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{sulfonamides}} (<b>sulfadiazine</b> or sulfamethoxazole) {{are sometimes}} {{mixed with the}} drug trimethoprim, which acts against dihydrofolate reductase. As of 2013, the Republic of Ireland is the largest exporter worldwide of sulfonamides, accounting for approximately 32% of total exports.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, <b>sulfadiazine,</b> and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E
500|$|In medicine, silver is {{incorporated}} into wound dressings {{and used as}} an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as they can to antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial {{in a variety of}} industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. [...] Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|In horses {{treatment}} has {{been confined to}} dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as the sulfonamides and pyrimethamine. [...] <b>Sulfadiazine</b> (20mg/kg orally) {{once or twice a}} day is a commonly used. Infected horses should also be placed on pyrimethamine at the dose of 1.0mg/kg given once a day orally for 120 days or longer. Diclazuril and Toltrazuril and other coccidiostats are being evaluated to treat EPM.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfadiazine</b> {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. In combination with pyrimethamine (a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor), <b>sulfadiazine</b> {{is used to}} treat active toxoplasmosis.|$|E
5000|$|Sulfonamides, {{including}} <b>sulfadiazine,</b> sulfasalazine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.|$|E
50|$|Pyrimethamine is {{typically}} given with folinic acid and <b>sulfadiazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of modern antibiotics, colloidal silver was used as a germicide and disinfectant. With the development of modern antibiotics in the 1940s, the use of silver as an antimicrobial agent diminished. Silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> (SSD) is a compound containing silver and the antibiotic sodium <b>sulfadiazine,</b> which was developed in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulfadiazine</b> — an {{antibiotic}} used {{in combination with}} pyrimethamine to treat toxoplasmosis ...|$|E
50|$|Side effects {{reported}} for <b>sulfadiazine</b> include: nausea, upset stomach, loss of appetite, and dizziness.|$|E
50|$|In combination, <b>sulfadiazine</b> and pyrimethamine, {{can be used}} {{to treat}} toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfadiazine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Sulfadiazine</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 2.70 to 7.32 USD a month. In the United States treatment costs more than 200 USD a month.|$|E
50|$|The US Food and Drug Administration has {{approved}} a number of topical preparations of silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> for treatment of second- and third-degree burns.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{allergic}} {{cross reaction}} with sulfa drugs has been occasionally reported, bacitracin-containing topical preparations remain a possible alternative to silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> (Silvadene) for burn {{patients with a}} sulfa allergy.|$|E
50|$|Pyrimethamine is {{also used}} in {{combination}} with <b>sulfadiazine</b> to treat active toxoplasmosis. The two drugs bind the same enzymatic targets as the drugs trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole - dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Sulfonamides (e.g. <b>sulfadiazine)</b> inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase, {{an enzyme}} that participates in folic acid {{synthesis}} from para-aminobenzoic acid. Hence, sulfonamides work synergistically with pyrimethamine by blocking a different enzyme needed for folic acid synthesis.|$|E
50|$|If {{vision is}} not compromised, {{treatment}} {{may not be}} necessary. When vision is affected or threatened, treatment consists of pyrimethamine, <b>sulfadiazine,</b> and folinic acid for 4-6 weeks. Prednisone is sometimes used to decrease inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Micro{{bacterium}} lacus is {{a bacterium}} from the genus of Microbacterium {{which has been}} isolated from sediments from the Shinji lake from the Shimane Prefecture in Japan. Microbacterium lacus {{has the ability to}} degrade <b>sulfadiazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Patients {{being treated}} for burns {{developed}} sudden anuric renal failure. Further investigation revealed all patients were treated with topical silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> ointment that contained 7 g/kg of DEG. This event caused the death of five patients.|$|E
50|$|Folinic acid is also {{sometimes}} {{used to prevent}} toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. It may be prescribed {{in the treatment of}} toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and <b>sulfadiazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Silver <b>sulfadiazine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand Silvadene among others, is a topical {{antibiotic}} used in partial thickness and full thickness burns to prevent infection. Tentative evidence has found other antibiotics {{to be more}} effective and therefore it is no longer generally recommended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfadiazine</b> is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Used {{together}} with pyrimethamine, {{it is the}} treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis. It is a second line treatment for otitis media, prevention of rheumatic fever, chancroid, chlamydia and infections by Haemophilus influenzae. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{patients}} survived {{after being}} successfully {{treated with a}} therapy consisting of flucytosine, pentamidine, fluconazole, <b>sulfadiazine</b> and azithromycin. Thioridazine was also given. Successful treatment in these cases was credited to [...] "awareness of Balamuthia as the causative agent of encephalitis and early initiation of antimicrobial therapy." ...|$|E
50|$|Edlich’s {{interest}} in {{emergency medical care}} was complemented by his clinical experience in burn care. After accepting the position as Director of University of Virginia Burn Center, which initially consisted of only two beds, he {{enlisted the help of}} benefactors as well as the University of Virginia to develop the 16-bed DeCamp Burn and Wound Healing Center, which included a hyperbaric oxygen treatment system for patients with necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans. He helped to devise a new silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> cream containing poloxamer 188 that exhibits less tissue toxicity than that of the commercially available silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> cream. Edlich devised a new Gram stain technique for quantitative bacteriology using stable iodophors rather than unstable aqueous iodine. This reliable Gram stain technique is now being used throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, headache, fever, rash, depression, and pancreatitis. It {{should not be}} used in people who have severe liver problems, kidney problems, or porphyria. If used during {{pregnancy}} it may increase the risk of kernicterus in the baby. Unlike other sulfonamides, <b>sulfadiazine</b> use is contraindicated in breastfeeding women.|$|E
50|$|It is {{primarily}} active against Plasmodium falciparum, but also against Plasmodium vivax. Due {{to the emergence}} of pyrimethamine-resistant strains of P. falciparum, pyrimethamine alone is seldom used now. In combination with a long-acting sulfonamide such as <b>sulfadiazine,</b> it was widely used, such as in Fansidar, though resistance to this combination is increasing.|$|E
50|$|Proteases such as trypsin and clostridiopeptidase, {{which are}} {{contained}} in ointments used {{for the removal of}} dead skin on wounds, can be inhibited by silver ions if applied simultaneously. When silver <b>sulfadiazine</b> is absorbed in significant amounts, it can increase effects and side effects of some drugs such as vitamin K antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Sulfonamides are {{prepared}} by the reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with ammonia or an amine.Certain sulfonamides (<b>sulfadiazine</b> or sulfamethoxazole) are sometimes mixed with the drug trimethoprim, which acts against dihydrofolate reductase. As of 2013, the Republic of Ireland is the largest exporter worldwide of Sulfonamides, accounting for approximately 32% of total exports.|$|E
50|$|The Chlamydiaceae are {{a family}} of {{bacteria}} that belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, order Chlamydiales. All Chlamydiaceae species are Gram-negative and express the family-specific lipopolysaccharide epitope αKdo-(2→8)-αKdo-(2→4)-αKdo (previously called the genus-specific epitope). Chlamydiaceae ribosomal RNA genes all have at least 90% DNA sequence identity. Chlamydiaceae species have varying inclusion morphology, varying extrachromosomal plasmid content, and varying <b>sulfadiazine</b> resistance.|$|E
50|$|Small extramacular lesions (lesions not {{threatening}} vision) may {{be observed}} without treatment. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4-6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, <b>sulfadiazine,</b> and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Folinic acid protects against {{the decrease in}} platelets and white blood cells induced by pyrimethamine.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is with penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, or co-trimoxazole {{for one to}} two years. Any {{treatment}} lasting {{less than}} a year has an approximate relapse rate of 40%. Recent expert opinion is that Whipple's disease should be treated with doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine for 12 to 18 months. Sulfonamides (<b>sulfadiazine</b> or sulfamethoxazole) may be added for treatment of neurological symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|On August 10, 2015, in {{accordance}} with Shkreli's business plan, Turing acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a medication approved by the FDA in 1953, from Impax Laboratories for [...] The drug's most prominent use as of late 2015 was as an anti-malarial and an antiparasitic, in conjunction with leucovorin and <b>sulfadiazine</b> to treat patients with AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated toxoplasmosis.|$|E
50|$|Monthly {{injections}} of long-acting penicillin {{must be given}} {{for a period of}} five years in patients having one attack of rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of therapy may be up to 40 years.Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low-dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, <b>sulfadiazine,</b> or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.|$|E
5000|$|On October 22, 2015, Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, {{announced}} {{that his company}} would provide a combination product containing pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) and leucovorin at [...] "$1-a-pill" [...] as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Daraprim. This product {{is intended to be}} used alongside <b>sulfadiazine</b> in the standard protocol to treat toxoplasmosis typically seen in AIDS patients.|$|E
