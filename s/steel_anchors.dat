40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives for}} this project were to explicitly define the anchor bolt corrosion problem {{in the state of}} Georgia and recommend action to the Georgia Department of Transportation. The bearing assembly of concern is the plate bearing assembly, in which carbon steel and/or bronze plates are anchored by either carbon steel or stainless <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts. Inspection report data revealed that anchor bolt corrosion was ubiquitous for all environments in Georgia; the problem was reported for 27 % of the steel girder bridges throughout the state. Based on a synthesis of the field investigations, bolt failure analyses, laboratory experimental testing, and review of GDOT inspection report surveys, the corrosion of carbon <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts is caused universally by concentration cell corrosion. Other corrosion mechanisms of concern are galvanic and crevice corrosion, which are both enhanced by the current bearing design. Corrosion protection provided through zinc galvanization cannot sufficiently protect the carbon steel bolt for its entire service life. Corrosion potential and cyclic polarization data confirmed that ASTM Type 304, Type 316, Type 2101, and Type 2205 were protected from concentration cell and localized corrosion in the simulated bearing environment. Therefore, it is recommended that the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts of these types be use in future designs and that the bolts should be electrically separated from all dissimilar metals using a Nylon or Teflon washer to prevent preferential corrosion of carbon steel. It is further recommended that the bronze lube plate should be eliminated entirely and that the bearing type should be a reinforced elastomeric bearing. Maintenance of existing sliding plate bearings should include regular cleaning by brushing away debris from the bearing surfaces, and bridges with carbon <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts should be retrofitted to provide additional lateral restraint according to current maintenance procedures.

40|$|In {{underground}} coal mines, rockbolts {{and cable}} bolts are two dominant {{forms of support}} elements to prevent instability of the surrounding rock mass. Using these <b>steel</b> <b>anchoring</b> elements with high strength and toughness provides better rock reinforcement in high stress environment, however failures identified of being caused by Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) have been observed.

Understanding and predicting this failure phenomenon plays a very important role in keeping the underground support system in good performance. This paper outlines the major developments of a study on SCC failure of the <b>steel</b> <b>anchoring</b> elements based on laboratory tests. SCC detecting technologies are discussed and, advantages and shortcomings related to each technology are provided. A SCC-Acoustic Emission (AE) testing system was set up in the Controlled Mine Environment (CME) laboratory at UNSW Australia that is aimed to provide a better understanding of this failure mode as well as to determine whether there is any relationship between AE signal activities and corrosive damage mechanisms. The test results showed the laboratory samples failed in a brittle manner and the cracking propagated in the transgranular mode. Evidences were found the cause of the failure is SCC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Steel is {{commonly}} used as the materials of anchor bolts in permanent anchoring works. The nature the <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolt easy to be corroded, however, poses a serious potential safety hazard to the anchoring system mainly including <b>steel</b> <b>anchor</b> bolts. To use GFRP(glass fiber reinforced polymer) anchor bolts instead of reinforcing bars is an effective means to deal with corrosion. Based on the test of accelerating aging in high solubility, the physical and mechanical performance tests are conducted on GFRP bolts in normal, acid, alkalis and salt conditions, from which the change law of physical and mechanical property can be studied for bolts in different corrosion conditions. As shown from the test results, the weight of GFRP bolt is reduced after it is corroded {{and the rate of}} weight loss increases as the corrosion time extends. Thick swelling can be seen on bolts in alkalis conditions. Loss rate of tensile strength and increase rate of elastic modulus are greater in alkalis conditions than in acid conditions, the former reaching 13. 76 % and the latter 9. 83 %. As for bolts in acid conditions, tensile strength decreases as the corrosion time extends while the rate and amount of loss is less than that of bolts in acid and alkalis conditions. The tensile strength decreases as the solubility of corrosion solution increases. The loss rate of tensile strength is the most for bolts in alkalis conditions; it comes second in acid conditions and the least in salt conditions. The elastic modulus of bolts in acid conditions and alkalis conditions increases while the rate is comparatively low as the solubility gets higher. Elastic modulus of bolts in salt conditions decreases as the solubility rises with lower rate and smaller amount of loss. These results supply test foundation for application of GFRP bolts in complicated geological conditions...|$|R
