5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

25|$|Granger {{was first}} noticed {{in a small}} stage {{production}} in Hollywood by a Goldwyn casting director, and given {{a significant role in}} The North Star, a controversial film praising the Soviet Union at the height of World War II, but later condemned for its political bias.

Here he made useful contacts, including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also where he began exploring his bisexuality, which he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> felt any need to conceal.|$|E
25|$|In early 1955, Parker {{became aware}} of a young singer named Elvis Presley. Presley had a singing style {{different}} from the current trend, and Parker was immediately interested {{in the future of}} this musical style. Presley’s first manager was Scotty Moore, the guitarist in his band, who was encouraged by Sun Records owner Sam Phillips to become his manager to protect Elvis from unscrupulous music promoters. In the beginning, Presley, Moore, and the bassist Bill Black were a trio, the Blue Moon Boys. However, when Presley signed a recording contract with Phillips, Moore and Black were excluded from the contract. Phillips told them to make a separate deal with Elvis. According to Moore, Presley agreed to take 50 percent, and Moore and Black would split the other 50 percent. Moore’s one-year management contract with Presley provided him with a 10-percent commission, which Moore <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> took. The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Presley and his parents. When the contract expired, the Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Presley’s manager. At that point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Presley. Neal was struggling at the time to accommodate his new client's success, and in February 1955, following a meeting with Parker, Presley agreed to let Parker take some control of future bookings and promotions.|$|E

500|$|As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father's hyper-pious character, he {{elected to}} stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was {{dominated}} by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, the Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone's immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone's mental decline: [...] "He carries [...] so far that it is <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> opens a letter, to avoid having to answer." [...] Additionally, Gian Gastone's fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking and staring up at the moon.|$|E

At 35 years old, Suter <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> contemplated retirement due to the ailments as he wanted to repay the Sharks for their support of him. He agreed to defer a portion of his salary that year to allow San Jose to sign a replacement player. Suter returned for the 1999–2000 season healthy and played over 20 minutes per game as San Jose's most experienced defenseman.|$|E

They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.|$|E
