5000|$|SSP is a disk-based {{operating}} system. Computer {{programs can}} be run from the fixed disk, but not from diskette or tape. The complement of a System/34 5340, or System/36 5360/5362 is a fixed disk array of one to four fixed disks, at least one computer terminal, and an 8" [...] <b>diskette</b> <b>drive,</b> optionally fitted with two magazine units that can contain 10 diskettes each and three diskette slots.. A S/36 5363/5364 has a 5-1/4" [...] <b>diskette</b> <b>drive.</b> S/36 computers can be configured with an 8809 reel-to-reel tape drive (800/1600 bpi) or a 6157 1/4" [...] cartridge (QIC) tape drive. A/36 computers have a high-density QIC drive but the 5.25" [...] or 8" [...] <b>diskette</b> <b>drive</b> (single) was optional as was a 9348-001 9 track (reel to reel) 1600/6250 bpi tape drive.|$|R

5000|$|The A/36 8" [...] <b>diskette</b> <b>drive</b> is {{optional}} and was marketed for approximately US$1,000. It was {{the easiest way}} to save files or programs from an A/36 and restore on a S/36.|$|R
50|$|WPS-8 {{normally}} {{runs from}} a single floppy diskette and user data can be stored on the system diskette or additional data-only diskettes. Up to four <b>diskette</b> <b>drives</b> are supported in a single system.|$|R
50|$|The PCX {{computer}} {{was made in}} 1986. It came normally with 256 KB of RAM, 80 column monitor, 2 x 360 KBs 5 <b>diskette</b> <b>drives,</b> 1 x 10 MBs hard disk drive, MS-DOS and GW-BASIC.|$|R

5000|$|Mid 1987: The {{original}} Ultra XT {{was created}} by Tony Ianuzzelli. It used a 6 MHz 8088 CPU, was supplied with 640KB of RAM, a single 5.25" [...] floppy <b>diskette</b> <b>drive,</b> CGA graphics and an optional 20Mb hard disk drive.|$|R
50|$|The T1100 PLUS is a later {{model of}} this laptop, {{released}} to the market in 1986. Some significant differences to the T1100 are, 80C86 CPU, 7.16 MHz or 4.77 MHz operation, expandable to 640 kB of RAM, and two internal <b>diskette</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R

50|$|The F-85 used {{single-sided}} 5¼-inch 100 tpi <b>diskette</b> <b>drives</b> providing 480 KB {{utilizing a}} high-density 4/5 group coded encoding. The machine {{was using a}} Western Digital FD1781 floppy disk controller with 77-track Micropolis drives. In later models this was expanded to a double-sided option for 960 KB (946/947 KB formatted) per diskette.|$|R
5000|$|For {{preparing}} {{data input}} diskettes, {{as a successor}} to card punches, there was a special workstation called a [...] "dual display" [...] (3742) which employed a system of mirrors to split a horizontally mounted screen into two 12x80 displays. Two users sat {{on either side of}} it with two keyboards and two <b>diskette</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A CG {{system could}} also include 8" [...] floppy <b>diskette</b> <b>drives,</b> a disk {{operating}} system for storing graphics images, and a version of Microsoft BASIC. These allowed the CG {{to be used as}} a standalone workstation, able to generate images without being connected to a host machine. Later enhancements included a Color Lookup Table and arithmetic processing unit.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{proprietary}} accessories available including a portable printer, bar code reader, and an early 3.5-inch <b>diskette</b> <b>drive,</b> the PF-10. The disk drives from the HX-20 could also be used. For the ROM cartridge slots a number of applications were available: Basic, CP/M utilities, Portable WordStar, CalcStar, Scheduler, dBase II and Portable Cardbox-Plus.|$|R
5000|$|The model 5363 was {{positioned}} {{as a replacement}} for the 5364, and was announced in October 1987. It used a deskside tower style enclosure like that of the 5362, but was only 2/3 the size. It featured updated hardware using newer, smaller hard drive platters, a 5" [...] <b>diskette</b> <b>drive,</b> and a revised distribution of the SSP.|$|R

The broad {{horizontal}} bar on the screen is an after-image of the lower editing window, which almost always contained text and which after years of editing left an impression on the screen's luminescent phosphors. A daisy-wheel printer was a separate cable-connected device, not shown.|$|R
50|$|The {{environmentally}} friendly PC borrowed some components from the ThinkPad line: including the Floppy <b>Diskette</b> <b>Drive</b> and the Hard Disk Drive, and {{was composed of}} recycled plastics designed to be easily recycled {{at the end of}} its life. The internal power supply would only consume a maximum of 24 watts and operated without the need of a fan completely passively cooled.|$|R
50|$|Single-sided disks {{began to}} become {{obsolete}} after {{the introduction of}} IBM PC DOS 1.1 in 1982, which added support for double-side <b>diskette</b> <b>drives</b> with capacity of 320 KB to the IBM 5150 PC. In 1983 PC DOS 2.0 pushed the formatting capacity to 180 KB single-sided or 360 KB double-sided by utilizing 9 instead of only 8 sectors per track.|$|R
5000|$|The CPT 8000 was the company's first {{microcomputer}} product, {{exhibited in}} spring of 1976. It was a self-contained desktop machine with two floppy <b>diskette</b> <b>drives,</b> a movable keyboard, and a full-page vertically oriented display with black characters {{on a white}} background, for a [...] view of text on paper. It was promoted as familiar {{and easy to use}} for those experienced with typewriters.|$|R
5000|$|Starting around 1985, Brother {{introduced}} {{a family of}} dedicated word processor typewriters with integrated 3.5-inch 38-track <b>diskette</b> <b>drive.</b> Early models of the WP and [...] used a Brother-specific group-coded recording scheme with twelve 256-byte sectors to store up to 120 KB on single-sided and up to 240 KB on double-sided double-density (DD) diskettes. Reportedly, prototypes were already shown at the Internationale Funkausstellung 1979 (IFA) in Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{note was}} the single motor used to drive both disk drives via a common spindle, which were {{arranged}} {{one on top of}} the other. That meant that one disk went underneath the first but inserted upside-down. This earned the <b>diskette</b> <b>drive</b> the nickname [...] "toaster". The unusual orientation confused many first-time users, who would complain that the machine would not read the disk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alignment}} pack {{was usually}} called the [...] "CE pack," [...] because IBM never called their 'service technicians' 'repairmen,' but [...] "Customer Engineers" [...] (CEs). And, since the alignment pack {{was only to}} be used by CEs, it was called the [...] "CE Pack." [...] Special CE media was also available for tape <b>drives</b> and <b>diskette</b> <b>drives,</b> known as [...] "the CE tape" [...] and [...] "the CE floppy." ...|$|R
50|$|By default, {{magneto-optical}} drives verify information {{after writing}} {{it to the}} disc, {{and are able to}} immediately report any problems to the operating system. This means writing can actually take three times longer than reading, but it makes the media extremely reliable, unlike the CD-R or DVD-R media upon which data is written without any concurrent data integrity checking. Using a magneto-optical disc is much more like using a <b>diskette</b> <b>drive</b> than a CD-RW drive.|$|R
