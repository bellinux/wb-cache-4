5000|$|Performed {{towards the}} end of Act Two, the song springs from Elphaba's rage over her {{continuously}} thwarted efforts to do good and her inner turmoil about her intention for doing so. It explores the ideas of goodness and wickedness, which are central to the musical's theme. In the song she lists what she perceives as her failures at goodness, including anger with herself over Fiyero—her lover who is being concurrently tortured by the Wizard's guards over her whereabouts—the death of her sister, and the capture and dehumanisation of her favorite teacher, Dr. Dillamond. It occurs while Elphaba believes that Galinda has used her sister's death to lure her into being captured by the Wizard's Guard. She is distraught at being vilified by the Wizard's propaganda and the hatred of the citizens of Oz, and decides she will no longer attempt to do good. The song begins with Elphaba screaming [...] "Fiyero" [...] but instead of being an unhitched scream, she actually sings a high note that is a minor second above the tonal centre of the song. This creates the effect of a scream, as the note is very high and dissonant, but it is much more controlled and musical than an actual scream. It then moves into a chant of magical words making it the most chilling and foreboding of all the musical's numbers. Schwartz is quoted as likening No Good Deed to an opera aria. He says, [...] "It’s just written for a different voice type, and it’s not written to be sung amplified. <b>So</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two big differences. I mean, “No Good Deed” is written for a belter—I suppose a mezzo-soprano could sing it. But the orchestra is so busy and obstreperous throughout {{that you have to have}} an amplified voice to carry over it, if you want to hear the words at all. But for instance there’s a moment in “No Good Deed” where she belts a big note and then there’s a place where it suddenly gets pianissimo — she has to hit the note very loud and hold it, and then get very soft — and that’s absolutely like something one would write in classical singing or an opera aria. Or the moment where she does “Nessa, Dr. Dillamond,” and then sort of shouts out “Fiyero” while the orchestra is sawing away at one of the motifs. I think it’s structured very much like an aria but it’s built to get a great big hand at the end with a big belted last note. So it’s still very much musical theatre." ...|$|E

40|$|Exploit your {{comparative}} advantages Cue: When choosing which crop to grow, {{there are}} two major factors that farmers must consider. The first is their agro-ecological situation, in other words, the character of the land they farm and the climate they live in. Temperature, rainfall, gradient of land and soil type will all have an influence on crop choice. The second factor involves the opportunities that the farmer will have to sell the crop. For example, if the farmer lives in a remote area far from any markets, {{it will be difficult to}} make a good profit from growing and selling a bulky, low value crop like maize, since the costs of transporting it to market will be so high. A low volume but high value crop like cashew nuts might be a better alternative. With the liberalisation of trade in Africa, the importance of farmers selecting the right crop for their situation has never been higher. Competition from foreign exports means that farmers have to exploit any comparative advantage they have in terms of what crops they can grow and which markets they can access. In Zambia, the National Farmers Union (the ZNFU), is helping farmers to cope with the pressures they have experienced since the liberalisation of the economy ten years ago. Alfred Mwila, an economist at the ZNFU spoke to Chris Kakunta about the problems and solutions for small-scale farmers. IN:		?The farmers have been ?? OUT:		??among our small-scale farmers. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alfred Mwila of the Zambia National Farmers Union encouraging farmers to exploit their comparative advantages in order to boost their profits. Transcript Mwila	The farmers have been facing the major problem of low producer prices, and the kind of enterprises that they are engaged in are not giving them the profits that will enable them to reinvest in agriculture. So essentially they are engaging in enterprises that are giving them a loss, and this is a big problem. For them to generate a profit they need to sell, they need to be guaranteed of a market, and they need to produce in the most cost effective way, and for this they need some facilitation. Kakunta	So as Zambia National Farmers Union, what are you doing in order to help these farmers come out of these negative impacts that have been created as a result of liberalised policies. Mwila	One of the things that we engage in is the provision of information to our members, to enable them make timely and economic decisions. We are able to advise our members that the appropriate crops for these areas are ABCD, what is an economic price for which they should sell their farm outputs. Kakunta	What about the farmers, what should they do themselves in order for them to benefit? Mwila	Our farmers need to embrace issues related to quality. They should be able to produce efficiently, package their produce, and be able to land their produce in their neighbouring countries or beyond, at a cost where they will make a profit. So they have a challenge as well, to position themselves strategically. They should stop growing or engaging in enterprises that are totally unprofitable. Our farmers need to produce, or engage in an enterprise that has comparative advantage. Before liberalisation, there was a deliberate policy to promote maize production, and maize as a result, was even promoted in areas where it is not agro-ecologically suitable, or indeed competitive, because of the distance from the market. So we need to reorient our farmers towards thinking of engaging in enterprises where they know that they are agro-ecologically suitable, and they are profitable. One province for example will be specialising in maize, because they are close to the market. Maize is a bulky product, so they will be able to take advantage of the closeness of the market, and they will be able to make a profit, because they will have less transport costs. Where it is impossible to grow maize, say Western Province, certainly we may just encourage them to grow maize at subsistence level, and not to look at maize as a cash crop. And they should be encouraged to grow what other provinces are not growing right now. And they would certainly have certain comparative advantages in, say, cashew nuts, because of the conditions there. It is certainly most ideal, and we should promote such enterprises. <b>So</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kind of issues that we feel should be addressed that have been a consequence of liberalisation. Ideally the small-scale sector to us is a very critical sector. It has been growing in number, but unfortunately not contributing to the economy in real terms. So that is a worry, and I think we need address something for this huge potential that exists among our small-scale farmers. End of track. An economist from Zambia?s National Farmers Union suggests that farmers need to be very careful in choosing which crops to grow, so that these match the capabilities of their land and climate, and the type of markets which they can access...|$|E
40|$|Domesticating {{wild fruit}} trees Cue: In Cameroon, {{as in other}} parts of Africa, people derive many {{benefits}} from wild, or indigenous, tree species. They are an important source of food and medicines for farming families, and can also be a source of income. However many forest fruit trees are being lost through deforestation and farmers are having to walk farther and farther from their homes to harvest them. One solution to this problem is for farmers to plant wild fruit species near their homes, a process called domestication. Ann Degrande, who works for ICRAF, the World Agroforestry Centre, in Cameroon, has been part of a programme to support fruit tree domestication. She spoke to Martha Chindong about the benefits indigenous fruit trees can offer, both to farmers and to the environment, and about the challenges facing farmers who want to earn income from their fruit. Martha began by asking whether the programme itself was supplying farmers with tree seedlings to plant. IN:		?The technology we are developing now is tree domestication. ? OUT:		?. will get him a more diverse package of income. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ann Degrande of the World Agroforestry Centre on how planting indigenous fruit trees benefits both farmers and the environment. Transcript Degrande	The technology we are developing now is tree domestication and we want people to select their own trees. So the best trees they can find in their environment. We teach them how to multiply, how to propagate those best trees that they can find in their environment. However, sometimes farmers in a particular village are asking for new species, for new trees that they can?t find in their environment. And then we try to link them up with other communities, with other farmers in other areas that have those trees on their farms. And we try to develop a kind of exchange of seeds or vegetative material. Chindong	What are the environmental aspects of it, are they really achieving anything? Degrande	That is a very interesting question, and the great advantage of agroforestry is that it can combine poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Because we are talking here of planting more trees to help farmers to get more income but by planting those trees we are also protecting the environment. Chindong	You talked of fruit trees or domestication. I wanted to find out whether these trees they plant only help for environmental protection or they have other benefits from the trees? Degrande	Trees usually have a lot of benefits. Trees can give fruits that can be sold on the market that can give income. The same fruits can also be eaten, consumed by the household and that has advantages for everybody in the household to have a more balanced diet, to have more vitamins, to have more minerals in their diet. The other benefit that trees have is that they can provide firewood, they can give shade, they can also protect against wind. Trees have many benefits and that?s the good thing about trees. Chindong	Ann, if I can get you well, it means that as of now you don?t have any problem with farmers accepting the new techniques of agroforestry, your problem is only to extend the technique? Degrande	No, that would be too much said. There are always problems when you introduce a new technology. First of all there is the problem of sensitising people. People need to be sensitised and informed about the new technique and the benefits of trees and the benefits of tree domestication. That is the first thing. The second thing is adopting new techniques and especially vegetative propagation needs some initial investment. You need for instance to set up a nursery, that requires some financial means, that sometimes individual farmers cannot have. Sometimes farmers group themselves and try to generate the necessary means to set up a nursery. But sometimes they need some help, they need financial support, maybe in the form of credit from NGO?s or the government. And then another thing is about the marketing, the commercialisation of the tree products. In Cameroon a lot of tree products are consumed widely, they are in the markets. But {{there are a lot of}} problems for farmers to get to those markets. There is for instance bad infrastructure, the roads are not good and that means that a lot of this fruit especially the perishable fruit remain in the village and cannot generate income for farmers although they are demanded in the market. So there is a whole issue of infrastructure and even support to farmer groups to commercialise their tree products. And that needs some attention I think from support organisations and even from government. Chindong	Considering the villages that you work with can you picture your farmers with hectares of agroforestry gardens? Degrande	I think it?s a progressive thing. What we first try to promote is that at least every farmer has some fruit trees or some beneficial trees on his farm or her farm. So we don?t exclude that some of the more enterprising farmers, they can go for hectares and hectares of fruit trees. There will be some farmers who will do that but the majority of farmers they will integrate trees in their cocoa farms, they will plant more trees on the boundaries of their farm, they will plant better trees in their home garden and that?s how they will get more out of these trees. Another thing is that we are also developing approaches to help to assist farmer groups to market their products as a group so that they get more bargaining power. <b>So</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> kind of things we are looking at and we want to make small changes but that will mean something to the farmer that will get him a more diverse package of income.

They have got hold of him, and {{he has all the}} arguments at his fingers' ends. When I came to the point, he began to demur; I saw what was passing through his mind, and I said at once: 'Your views are high: so <b>are</b> mine: <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> of <b>the</b> Church. It <b>is</b> a sacrifice, undoubtedly, in a certain sense. No sound theologian would maintain the simplicity of the elements; but that does not involve the coarse interpretation of the dark ages.'" ...|$|R
50|$|God is {{a metaphor}} for a mystery that {{absolutely}} transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in <b>the</b> world <b>are</b> religious people who think that their metaphors <b>are</b> facts. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> what we call theists. <b>The</b> other half <b>are</b> people who know that <b>the</b> metaphors <b>are</b> not facts. And <b>so,</b> they're lies. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> atheists.|$|R

The nerve fibres there figured are bound together by endoneurium into small ropes, the nerves, encased in perineurium. There {{is always a}} grey axis cylinder (a.c.), which may (in medullated nerves), or may not (in non-medullated or grey nerves) have a medullary sheath (s.S.) interrupted at intervals by the nodes of Ranvier (n.R.). Nuclei (n.) at intervals under the sheath indicate the cells from which nerve fibres are derived by a process of elongation. The nerves of invertebrata, where they possess nerves, are mostly grey, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> of <b>the</b> sympathetic system of vertebrata, to be presently described, g.c., g.c. are ganglion cells; they may have many hair-like processes, usually running into continuity with the axis cylinders of nerve fibres, in which case they are called multi-polar cells, {{or they may be}} uni- or bi-polar.|$|R
