Such indicators are put into an asset and liability management decision making context, where the relationship between the expected profit and the capital at risk are compared to evaluate the issue of the bond and the expected rate of return of the whole portfolio.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the opaqueness of <b>structured</b> <b>bonds,</b> such as mortgage-backed {{securities}}, asset-backed securities and collateral debt obligations, was one of the major causes of the recent financial crisis that started in late 2007. We analyse the evolving nature of information asymmetry inherent in various types of <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> by examining the U. S. insurers’ assets. We show that, prior to 2004, <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> were not associated with greater information asymmetry; however, holding more multi-class <b>structured</b> <b>bonds,</b> especially privately placed bonds, increased the information asymmetry when evaluating insurers’ assets post- 2004. The effect of information asymmetry was more significant with life insurers than with non-life insurers. In addition, by investigating the rating grades of such <b>structured</b> <b>bonds,</b> we find that the market views higher-grade, privately placed, multi-class <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> as having the highest information asymmetry among all types of <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> post 2004, an effect which is, again, more significant with life insurers. This result shows that structuring complexities and unreliable ratings make <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> more opaque than just securitisation itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{collapse}} of <b>structured</b> <b>bond</b> ratings during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis {{called attention to}} the possibility of rating inflation due to lowered rating standards and rating shopping. Nevertheless, little empirical evidence has been offered for this prospect. The Israeli corporate credit rating market serves as solid ground for investigating this matter. In this study, we use data on corporate bond ratings assigned by two local rating agencies affiliated with S&P and Moody’s during the period 2004 - 2009. We show that while one agency (Midroog) systematically assigned higher ratings, the ratings of the other agency (S&P-Maalot) were inflated due to rating shopping. These conclusions are based on several findings: the presence of selection bias in dual ratings, the superior accounting features of firms rated by S&P-Maalot relative to those similarly rated by Midroog, and the greater tendency of single ratings by S&P-Maalot to be downgraded. We confirm the predictions of recent theoretical studies that rating inflation may occur even when the value of the rating agencies derives from their reputation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunity}} of o¤ering a 8 ̆ 5 xed {{level of guarantee}} is {{the response to the}} demand of more sophisticated consumers for both pension funds and life insurance policies. The current tendency is the exibility and an interesting extent of this evolution is the introduction of a variable minimum guarantee. Pension funds are private pension structures organized through two main schemes: de 8 ̆ 5 ned contribution (DC) and de 8 ̆ 5 ned bene 8 ̆ 5 t (DB). The two schemes can be arranged to customize more complex needs, for example the targeted money purchase (TMP) in which is guaranteed a minimum pension payment plus any upside potential {{in the value of the}} fund assets that exceeds the target level. Set L the liability level and A the underlying assets, at the retirement date the present value of the TPM pension scheme is: TMP = A+ P = max (A;L) = max (DC;DB) = C + L (1) where P and C are european, respectively, put and call written on the assets A, with the same exercise price L. Index and Unit linked insurance products provide their customers with the performance realized to the underlying 8 ̆ 5 nancial index or unit of an inter-nal/external mutual fund. In traditional insurance practice the 8 ̆ 5 nancial risk is completely charged on the insurer, nowadays the modern tendency consists of recognizing a minimum guarantee. The payo ¤ of an Index-Unit linked contract can be described as: V = max (K;ST) (2) where K represents the minimum guarantee and ST is the reference asset value at maturity T. The replication strategy of this contract is realized through a 1 <b>structured</b> <b>bond,</b> whose payo ¤ is a portfolio, with maturity T, made up by a risk free zero coupon bond with nominal value K and a european call written on the underlying S with strike K or the underlying ST and a european put written on the asset S with strike K...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> {{from a new}} perspective: the expost {{return of}} structured products is compared to the return of risk free bonds {{in order to test}} if the paradigm "the riskier the product the greater the expected return" holds. This question is relevant since in Italy <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued by banks and sold out to retail customers with huge implicit premiums with respect to their fair value. The work is based on a unique data set based both on information provided by Borsa Italiana (Italian Stock Exchange) and from each single prospectus. The study reveals a striking advantage of risk free <b>bonds</b> over <b>structured</b> products: although the latter carry a higher level of risk they show lower returns. This work oers another contribute to current literature: it provides a classication of the products issued by Italian banks {{on the basis of the}} derivative instrument embedded in the bond. The Italian market is characterized by a huge fragmentation; each issue has its own underlying and its own indexation rule, the nominal value is often very low and the econdary market suers from a lack of liquidity. As a consequence <b>structured</b> <b>bonds</b> do not seem suitable for retail investors that are not able to understand the real riskreturn prole of the instrument...|$|R
