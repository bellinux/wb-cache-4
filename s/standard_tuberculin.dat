40|$|Objective/background: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{infectious}} diseases in Iran and around the world. Diagnosis of this disease in many cases is difficult and often requires the use of paraclinical methods. Current diagnostic methods are either too slow or lack enough sensitivity or specificity. Several mycobacterial antigens are involved in the complex interaction with the immune system of the host. They can be helpful for mycobacteria diagnosis. Antigen 60 (A 60) is a thermostable antigen found in the cytosol of Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This antigen is used in ELISA systems design for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The aim of this study is purification of A 60 from bacterial cytoplasm and to evaluate the efficiency of this antigen and compare it with the production human <b>tuberculin</b> and <b>standard</b> human <b>tuberculin.</b> Methods: Using gel filtration chromatography with a sepharose 4 B column, A 60 was purified from other bacterial components. A 60 was recognized by agar gel immunodiffusion with anti-BCG and anti-A 60 antiserum, where it formed an immunoprecipitation line with anti-BCG antiserum and anti-A 60 antiserum. Molecular weight components of the A 60 were obtained using electrophoresis. Results: Seven fractions were obtained by chromatography. In analyzing with dot blotting, both the cytoplasm and cell wall of BCG had A 60. This test showed that the first fraction creates maximum color intensity and as a result, the highest amount of A 60 was in fraction one. In agar gel immunodiffusion, the cytoplasm sample and all fractions obtained from chromatography showed a positive reaction with anti-A 60 antiserum, and fraction one had the most among sediment of the other fractions. Molecular weight components of the A 60 were identified to be approximately 35 kDa, 38 kDa, 40 kDa, and 65 kDa. Conclusion: Results of reactions of the injected A 60 and <b>standard</b> human <b>tuberculin</b> shows the effectiveness of this antigen in comparison with <b>standard</b> human <b>tuberculin.</b> Detection of antibody in the serum of patients is a rapid and repeatable method.

In regions {{with a low}} incidence of tubercu-losis, lymphadenitis thought {{to be due to}} nontuberculous mycobacteria should be managed as such, regardless of Man-toux results, thereby avoiding antituberculosis treatment. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous organisms that can cause various clinical syndromes. The most common mani-festation in children is cervical lymphadenitis; bone, joint, skin, soft-tissue, pulmonary, catheter-related, and disseminated in-fections are much less common [1]. A definitive diagnosis re-quires isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria from a sterile site. However, presumptive diagnoses are often made on the combined basis of clinical findings (e. g., cervical lymphade-nitis), epidemiological features (e. g., population with low prev-alence of tuberculosis), and positive results of tuberculin skin testing.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{plays an}} important role in containing mycobacterial infections. With the rapidly increasing role of TNF inhibitors in dermatology, tuberculosis (TB) is becoming an important and worrisome concern to dermatologists. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the incidence of TB in patients treated with anti-TNF, the variety of TB screening methods, and management of these cases. Various national recommendations have been highlighted. The monoclonal antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, appear to be more associated with the risk of TB reactivation than the soluble receptor etanercept. Tuberculosis associated with TNF inhibitors, in contrast to classical TB, is more likely to be disseminated, atypical, extra pulmonary, and life threatening. Vigilance for typical and atypical presentations of active TB is mandatory until the end of therapy. Although <b>tuberculin</b> <b>standard</b> test (TST) has been the gold standard for screening of latent TB infection (LTBI) for close to a century, it has several inadequacies and may be unreliable in patients with widespread psoriasis.

40|$|Background: The role of new T-cell–based {{blood tests}} for {{tuberculosis}} {{in the diagnosis}} of active tuberculosis is unclear. Objective: To compare the performance of 2 interferon-? assays and tuberculin skin testing in adults with suspected tuberculosis. Design: Prospective study conducted in routine practice. Setting: 2 urban hospitals in the United Kingdom. Patients: 389 adults, predominantly of South Asian and black ethnicity, with moderate to high clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis. Intervention: Tuberculin skin testing, the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) incorporating early secretory antigenic target- 6 and culture filtrate protein- 10 (standard ELISpot), and ELISpot incorporating a novel antigen, Rv 3879 c (ELISpotPLUS) were performed during diagnostic assessment by independent persons who were blinded to results of the other test. Measurements: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. Results: 194 patients had a final diagnosis of active tuberculosis, of which 79 % were culture-confirmed. Sensitivity for culture confirmed and highly probable tuberculosis was 89 % (95 % CI, 84 % to 93 %) with ELISpotPLUS, 85 % (CI, 79 % to 90 %) with standard ELISpot, 79 % (CI, 72 % to 85 %) with 15 -mm threshold tuberculin skin testing, and 83 % (CI, 77 % to 89 %) with stratified thresholds of 15 and 10 mm in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively. The ELISpotPLUS assay was more sensitive than tuberculin skin testing with 15 -mm cutoff points (P = 0. 01) but not with stratified cutoff points (P = 0. 10). The ELISpotPLUS assay had 4 % higher diagnostic sensitivity than standard ELISpot (P = 0. 02). Combined sensitivity of ELISpotPLUS and tuberculin skin testing was 99 % (CI, 95 % to 100 %), conferring a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 02 (CI, 0 to 0. 06) when both test results were negative.

We assessed contacts for LTBI using TST and IGRA at baseline and six weeks. We examined TST/IGRA discordance in qualitative and quantitative analyses, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations to analyze predictors of discordance. We included 96 TB patients and 384 contacts. Discordance decreased from 15 % at baseline to 8 % by six weeks. In adjusted analyses, discordance was related to less crowding (p = 0. 004), non-cavitary disease (OR 1. 41, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 96; p = 0. 03), and marginally with BCG vaccination in contacts (OR 1. 40, 95 % CI: 0. 99 - 1. 98, p = 0. 06).

Those employees who tested negative by QFT-G were asked to repeat their skin test with both Tubersol and Aplisol tuberculin preparations. Of the new purified protein derivative converters, 12 of 14 returned for repeat testing with QFT-G, and the assay was negative for 83 % (10 / 12), positive for 8 % (1 / 12), and indeterminate for 8 % (1 / 12) of the individuals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} latent tuberculosis infection {{reduces the risk}} of progression to severe disseminated disease. However, in young children, a major limitation of the <b>standard</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin test is that false-negative results cannot be detected. The new interferon-gamma release assays QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Cellestis Carnegie Victoria, Australia), QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube (Cellestis), and T-SPOT. TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, United Kingdom) show promise of greater accuracy, but they may also be affected by impaired cellular immunity, resulting in indeterminate results (ie, insufficient response in positive-control wells). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of age on the performance of interferon-gamma release assays when used in a routine hospital setting among children tested for suspected active or latent TB infection. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 496 children 0 to 19 years of age who had been tested with the tuberculin skin test and at least 1 interferon-gamma release assay: 181 with QuantiFERON-TB Gold and 315 with QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube. In 154 of the children, paired interferon-gamma release assay testing was available: 87 with QuantiFERON-TB Gold/T-SPOT. TB and 67 with QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube/T-SPOT. TB. RESULTS: Compared with T-SPOT. TB, the rates of indeterminate results were significantly higher for both QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube. QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube also gave indeterminate results more frequently in children /= 4 years of age. Indeterminate results were associated with younger age for both QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube but not for T-SPOT. TB. Considering age as a binary variable (/= 4 years of age), a significantly higher concentration of phytohaemagglutinin-produced interferon-gamma was observed in older children with both QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube. CONCLUSION: Different blood tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in children seem to perform differently, because both QuantiFERON-TB tests were more likely than T-SPOT.

To address this deficiency, we conducted a longitudinal assessment of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot test (ELISPOT) test {{in comparison to the}} <b>standard</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin test (TST). In tuberculosis (TB) contacts we repeated ELISPOT tests 3 mo (n = 341) and 18 mo (n = 210) after recruitment and TSTs at 18 mo (n = 130). We evaluated factors for association with conversion and reversion and investigated suspected cases of TB. Of 207 ELISPOT-negative contacts, 51 (24. 6 %) had 3 -mo ELISPOT conversion, which was associated with a positive recruitment TST (odds ratio [OR] 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 - 5. 0, p = 0. 048) and negatively associated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination (OR 0. 5, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 1. 0, p = 0. 06). Of 134 contacts, 54 (40. 2 %) underwent 3 -mo ELISPOT reversion, which was less likely in those with a positive recruitment TST (OR 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 1 - 0. 8, p = 0. 014). Between 3 and 18 mo, 35 / 132 (26. 5 %) contacts underwent ELISPOT conversion and 28 / 78 (35. 9 %) underwent ELISPOT reversion. Of the 210 contacts with complete results, 73 (34. 8 %) were ELISPOT negative at all three time points; 36 (17. 1 %) were positive at all three time points. Between recruitment and 18 mo, 20 (27 %) contacts had ELISPOT conversion; 37 (50 %) had TST conversion, which was associated with a positive recruitment ELISPOT (OR 7. 2, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 37. 1, p = 0. 019); 18 (32. 7 %) underwent ELISPOT reversion; and five (8. 9 %) underwent TST reversion. Results in 13 contacts diagnosed as having TB were mixed, but suggested higher TST sensitivity. Both ELISPOT conversion and reversion occur after M. tuberculosis exposure. Rapid ELISPOT reversion may reflect M. tuberculosis clearance or transition into dormancy and may contribute to the relatively low reported ELISPOT conversion rate. Therefore, a negative ELISPOT test for M. tuberculosis infection should be interpreted with caution...|$|E
