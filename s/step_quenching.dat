5000|$|Martempering is {{also known}} as stepped {{quenching}} or interrupted quenching. In this process, steel is heated above the upper critical point and then quenched in a salt bath kept at a temperature of 150-300° C. The workpiece is held at this temperature above (Ms) until the temperature becomes uniform throughout the cross-section of workpiece. After that it is cooled in air or oil to room temperature. The steel is then tempered. Martempering is a heat treatment for steel involving austenitisation followed by <b>step</b> <b>quenching,</b> at a rate fast enough to avoid the formation of ferrite, pearlite or bainite to a temperature slightly above the martensite start (Ms) point.|$|E

40|$|<b>Step</b> <b>quenching</b> {{from the}} solid {{solution}} temperature {{is a common}} treatment to enhance the shape memory properties in many copper-based shape memory alloys (SMAs). However, the martensite stabilisation problem is more serious in step quenched Cu-Al-Ni-Mn-Ti (CANTiM) SMAs. After <b>step</b> <b>quenching,</b> martensite in CANTiM cannot reverse transform to its parent phase. In contrast, fast quenching rates usually lead to better shape memory properties in CANTiM SMA. When the alloy is directly quenched into KOH, martensite stabilisation is still present. However, martensite stabilisation can be removed by post-quench ageing at 100 °C. In rapid quenching from high temperature, {{a large number of}} defects such as vacancies are usually produced. The martensite stabilisation due to fast quenching is attributed to the pinning effect of these excessive vacancies. After post-quench ageing, the concentration of vacancies is lowered and thus the pinning effect is reduced. This paper reports the behaviour of vacancies at different cooling rates in different quenching medium, and the effect of post-quench ageing. The evolution of vacancies in the alloy is studied using positron annihilation techniques. In contrast to the martensite stabilisation due to ageing at higher temperatures, the martensite stabilisation due to fast quenching rate can be removed by a carefully chosen low temperature ageing programme. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The first approach is a warm forming route to form sheets in T 6 temper state with high tensile strength at temperatures between 150 °C and 300 °C. The second approach is a hot forming route.

40|$|The β 1 α 1 loop in the {{tryptophan}} biosynthetic enzyme indole- 3 -glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) {{is important}} for substrate binding, product release and chemical catalysis. IGPS catalyzes the ring closure of the substrate 1 -(o-carboxyphenylamine) - 1 -dexoyribulose 5 -phosphate to form indole- 3 -glycerol phosphate, involving distinct decarboxylation and dehydration steps. The ring closure step is rate-determining in the thermophilic Sulfolobus sulfataricus enzyme (ssIGPS) at high temperatures. The β 1 α 1 loop is especially important in the dehydration step as it houses the general acid Lys 53. We propose that loop dynamics are governed by competing interactions on the N- and C-terminal sides of the loop. We had previously shown that disrupting interactions with the N-terminal side of the loop through the N 90 A substitution decreases catalytic efficiency, slows down the dehydration <b>step</b> and <b>quenches</b> loop dynamics on the picosecond to millisecond timescales.

Interestingly, the triple substitution R 64 A/D 65 A/N 90 A leads to new μs–ms timescale loop dynamics and makes the ring-closure step rate-determining once again.

Thus enables SG irons {{to be used for}} numerous industrial applications. Alloying element addition greatly affects the mechanical properties of SG iron with Mn, Cu, Si and Ni being more predominant. While copper helps increasing the hardness causing no embrittlement in the matrix, Ni helps enhancing the ultimate tensile strength without affecting the impact energy values. Therefore addition of Cu and Ni plays key role in determining the end properties of SG iron after heat treatment. The high ratio of performance to cost which it offers to the designer and end user makes it to be used extensively for industrial uses. However, to enhance the consistency & range of properties of SG iron beyond its properties while in as-cast condition, Heat treatment is a required operation.

The LENS™ deposited gradient were solutionized, and <b>step</b> <b>quenched</b> to specific aging temperature, and the resulting microstructures and phase were characterized utilizing XRD, EDS, SEM, FIB and TEM.

The product of this processing technique was characterized in a similar way as the graded LENS™ depositions. From measurements performed on Ti-Sb it seems that Sb could be a potential α stabilizer in Ti due to the presence of a mostly homogeneous α grains throughout the gradient; however, from XRD it can be understood that a titanium antimonide phase is present.

RK undergoes intramolecular phosphorylation, resulting in the incorporation of three or four phosphates per RK molecule. Phosphorylated RK subsequently is a substrate for protein phosphatases 2 A and 2 B. We isolated three forms of RK based on their differential interactions with heparin-Sepharose. Fully phosphorylated RK (alpha-RK) binds tightly to Rho but has significantly lower affinity to phosphorylated Rho, whereas unphosphorylated RK (gamma-RK) binds avidly to both forms of Rho. The heterogenous intermediately phosphorylated RK (beta-RK) was not studied. Our data support the hypothesis that RK dissociates from Rho when both Rho and RK become phosphorylated, thereby allowing the binding of arrestin to phosphorylated Rho. These results suggest that autophosphorylation {{plays an important role in}} regulating the binding of RK to Rho and that the binding sites of RK and arrestin overlap at least partially...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the quenching and partitioning (Q&P) process in steels involves a microstructural evolution that {{is more complex than}} just the formation of martensite followed by carbon partitioning from martensite to austenite. Examples of this complexity are the formation of epitaxial ferrite during the first <b>quenching</b> <b>step</b> and the formation of bainite, carbides, and carbon gradients as well as migration of martensite/austenite interfaces during the partitioning step. In this work, recent investigations on the mechanisms controlling microstructural changes during the {{application of}} the Q&P process are evaluated, leading to phase-formation based concepts for the design of Q&P steels.

40|$|Quenching {{experiments}} are performed using {{state of the}} art p-type Czochralski-grown Ge samples. The vacancy formation energy and thermal equilibrium concentration are determined on the basis of resistivity changes measured after quenching, using van der Pauw and Hall measurements. The results are compared with previously published experimental data and with results from analytical and ab initio calculations of the formation energy of the vacancy in different charge states. The deep levels introduced during the <b>quenching</b> <b>step</b> are studied with deep level transient spectroscopy and with FTIR, revealing besides the typical quenching related defects which are probably connected with vacancies also the presence of Cu.

40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on {{analyzing}} {{the effect of the}} interrupted quenching followed by a partitioning process in a high carbon steel 0, 50 % C, 1, 50 % Mn, 0, 40 % Si, 2, 00 % Cr without significant contribution of Al. Thermal treatments were performed at laboratory scale in a quenching dilatometer Linseis R. I. T. A RL 78. The fractions of retained austenite were evaluated by scanning electron microscope. The temperature for the interrupted quenching phase was evaluated based on the Koistenen and Marburger equation (adapted to the 0, 50 % C steel) and the result highlights a correlation between the chosen different temperature of quenching and the fraction of retained austenite formed during the <b>quenching</b> <b>step</b> of the process...|$|R
