25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in Roundhay Park, Leeds, on 9 May. Walking {{home from}} a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At {{the time of this}} attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.|$|E
2500|$|Martin auditioned so {{well that}} her parents soon allowed her to attend them by herself. Her mother recalled, [...] "I'll never forget the first {{interview}} she went on. It was for a Chrysler commercial, and my car broke down about six blocks from the studio. I had {{to stay with the}} car, but Lori was all for going on in herself. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, walked six blocks, found the right office, told the receptionist who she was, went in for her interview and got the job. Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diane Settegast and Eunice Woolen, {{who stayed}} with the Hills as house guests a week before Joan's death, would later {{describe}} how Hill brought home pastries, but insisted on choosing which ones each of them would eat. Hill would return home with the pastries in the evenings after being called away by a message on his pager. On Friday, March 14, the Hills attended Houston's annual wild game dinner, where John played a concert with the Heartbeats. They left early, {{and on the way}} home Joan asked her husband if he would be staying out all night again. When he said that he probably would, she reminded him that he had done this on two previous occasions that week. The conversation quickly descended into an argument in which she told him that if he did stay out, he should not bother to come back. When they arrived home, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, and he began to drive away, at which point she became angry and shouted [...] "You've blown it, John! You've just lost your wife, your son and your god damn music room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring {{with you}} the limes {{you have in your}} desk," [...] was the {{unexpected}} command which arrested her before <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her seat.|$|R
60|$|She {{had come}} to a resolution. Abruptly <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, {{smoothed}} her sheet and straightened her pillow and lay down, and fell almost instantly asleep.|$|R
60|$|When Jim Cleve did see Joan in {{her dress}} {{the first time}} he {{appeared}} so glad and relieved and grateful that she feared he might betray himself, so <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his sight.|$|R
2500|$|Elle {{heads to}} the Hair Affair {{to say goodbye to}} Paulette, but before she can leave, Vivienne and Enid {{convince}} Elle otherwise. Elle discards her lawyerly navy suits, dons a pink dress and leads a parade back to the courtroom. They meet Kyle on the way, who takes a liking to Paulette, and reveals himself to be the Irish man of her dreams, prompting to Irish Dance among the ensemble. Back at the trial, Brooke fires Callahan and hires Elle ("Legally Blonde Remix"). Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney goes to the witness stand and her testimony is damning, stating after <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shower she saw Brooke covered in her father's blood. After Chutney states she received a perm the day of the murder, Elle realizes a flaw in Chutney's alibi and suggests that the entire court should be moved {{to the scene of the}} crime - the bathroom where the murder took place ("Scene of the Crime"). As a demonstration, Elle asks Paulette to give Enid a perm, and asks Enid to step into the shower upon entering the crime scene. Relying on her knowledge of hair maintenance, Elle's demonstration is successful as Enid walks out of the shower with completely flattened hairâ€”revealing that Chutney could not have possibly showered immediately after getting a perm because her perm was still intact. Under Elle's intense questioning, Chutney accidentally confesses that she killed her father, thinking that it was Brooke ("Omigod You Guys (Reprise)"). Chutney is arrested and Brooke is set free.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{she could}} only talk what a tale {{she would have to}} tell," [...] {{observed}} Paul as they rode homeward. [...] "I wonder how <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river?" ...|$|E
60|$|Little Mrs. Bailey {{was waiting}} for her on the {{platform}} when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. Her face was drawn and miserable. She looked like a beaten kitten. She hugged Ruth hysterically.|$|E
5000|$|By 1889, she {{was called}} [...] "the best known woman on Long Island." [...] <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{politics}} when newspapers ridiculed her maneuvers. Until then, Barnum {{was able to make}} or break political careers.|$|R
50|$|The Kelley Deal 6000 was an {{alternative}} rock band formed in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States, and was active between 1995 and 1997. They were formed by Kelley Deal when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> rehab in 1995.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{gave him}} a {{withering}} glance from her black eyes, wheeled her pony and galloped away. A mellow laugh was borne to her ears before <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing, and again the red blood mantled her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose it's {{just as well}} she's gone, {{though you}} DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion, Anne. I don't see how <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pen, though. She must have broken some of the boards off." ...|$|E
60|$|At last <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. When she {{was back}} in her own room, in the light, and her door was closed, she stood holding up her hand that had touched him, as if it were hurt. She was almost too shocked, she could not endure.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little bit; but not near {{as bad as}} {{she used}} to be. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asylum in Brooklyn yesterday, and I've had my hands full {{trying to get her}} back. She imagines she is a sea captain and always runs off with my uncle's yacht." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Dr. Grantly, [...] "if it {{be true that}} Mr. Slope and Mrs. Bold {{came here}} together. Susan says she is almost sure she saw their faces in the same {{carriage}} as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her own." ...|$|R
50|$|At some point, her {{activities}} became notorious in the press, and <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> politics. However, her brother, Francis B. Baldwin, {{was able}} to piggyback an influential political career on her previous unofficial position. He became a state assemblyman in 1878, then county treasurer.|$|R
5000|$|Tempestra (voiced by Gaille Heidemann) - Tempestra is a {{powerful}} weather-controlling sorceress who came from a video game that <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> during a thunderstorm. In [...] "Night of the Rogues," [...] Tempestra was among the villains that helped Shredder and Krang attack the Turtles.|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} feel very anxious and very lonely. She descended from the log, and walked along till <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bushes. She came {{to a place where}} there were rocks, with smooth {{surfaces}} of moss and grass among them. She found a shady place among these rocks, and sat down upon the moss. She laid her head down upon her arm and began to weep bitterly.|$|E
60|$|Captain Anthony {{had stopped}} for a moment staring ahead from the break of the poop, and poor Flora sent at his back a look of despairing appeal which would have moved a heart of stone. But as though she had done nothing he did not stir in the least. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long chair and went towards the companion. Her father {{followed}} carrying a few small objects, a handbag, her handkerchief, a book. They went down together.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you have {{destroyed}} my happiness by your unreasonable jealousy," [...] said the wife. [...] "Have you considered what I must feel in having such words addressed to me by my husband? If I am fit to be told that I must promise not to see any man living, I cannot be fit to be any man's wife." [...] Then she burst out into an hysterical fit of tears, and in this condition <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage, entered her house, and hurried up to her own room.|$|E
60|$|But Harry's racket {{had a good}} effect, after all. It woke Aunt Judy, {{and after}} a time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, {{uncovered}} the fire, blew up a little blaze, lighted a candle, and putting on some clothes, came and opened the door, grumbling all the time.|$|R
50|$|Later, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{coaching}} {{track to}} coach football alongside {{her husband and}} eventually coached her son Scott Frost during {{his days as a}} star at Wood River High School. Scott, a former offensive coordinator with the Oregon Ducks, is the current head coach at the University of Central Florida (UCF).|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} very sleepless that night, she said, and took the reports of the falling stars for shooting; there had been rioting in Clayton and all through Swathinglea all day, and so <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed to look. She had a dim sense that I was in all such troubles.|$|R
60|$|Sarah {{counted the}} visit not all in vain, however, for she quite closely {{reproduced}} Rose's shirt-waist the following week--that much <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> call. Carl was awed and troubled a little {{by the failure}} of his bride to get on with Rose, and Rose was bitter over it in heart. She could not see the fun of all this, as so many story-writers had done. It was all pitiful and bitter and barren, and to eat with the knife and drink coffee with a loud, sipping sound were inexcusable misdemeanors to her overwrought temper.|$|E
60|$|But as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{train at}} Morningside Park Station {{she had a}} shock. She saw, twenty yards down the platform, the shiny hat and broad back and inimitable swagger of Ramage. She dived at once behind {{the cover of the}} lamp-room and {{affected}} serious trouble with her shoe-lace until {{he was out of the}} station, and then she followed slowly and with extreme discretion until the bifurcation of the Avenue from the field way insured her escape. Ramage went up the Avenue, and she hurried along the path with a beating heart and a disagreeable sense of unsolved problems in her mind.|$|E
60|$|She came up {{from the}} Dillsborough Station alone in the Bush omnibus. She had not {{expected}} any one to meet her. Why should any one meet her? The porter put up her box and the omnibus left her at the door. But she remembered well how she had gone down with Reginald Morton, and how delightful had been every little incident of the journey. Even to walk with {{him up and down}} the platform while waiting for the train had been a privilege. She thought of it as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage and remembered that she had felt that the train had come too soon.|$|E
50|$|For {{her second}} sortie, <b>she</b> barely <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Bay of Biscay.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> quickly <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, {{and they}} went {{together}} into the parlour.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} was as dark and foggy {{as if it}} was mid-November instead of early March. Ann Veronica woke rather later than usual, and lay awake for some minutes before she remembered a certain {{resolution}} she had taken in the small hours. Then instantly <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and proceeded to dress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{first when}} <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage, covered with jet anchor chains--for you know Uncle Samuel died {{only three months}} ago and left her all his money--she caught sight of our heads staring at {{her out of the}} drawing-room window, and asked father if he kept a girls' school. Then she made mother cry by {{remarking}} that she ought to be thankful to Providence for having taken to its bosom the four of us who died young --you know she has no children herself and so can't feel about them. Also father was furious because she told him that at least half of us should have been boys. He turned quite pink and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|With those words, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage. Rufus {{offered her}} his arm. She {{put her hand}} in it as readily {{as if they had}} been old friends. [...] "Let us take one of the side paths," [...] she said; [...] "they are almost deserted at this time of day. I am afraid I {{surprise}} you very much. I can only trust to your kindness to forgive me for passing you without notice the last time we met. Perhaps it may be some excuse for me that I am in great trouble. It is just possible you may be able to relieve my mind. I believe you know I am engaged to be married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Working like a beaver. You see"--and then, to her utter amazement, Frank {{entered into}} an {{elaborate}} statement of his affairs, quite {{as if she}} understood all about it and her opinion was valuable. It was all Greek to Anna, but she was immensely gratified; for {{it was just the}} way the boy used to tell her his small concerns in the days when each had firm faith in the other's wisdom. She tried to look as if she understood all about [...] "investments, percentage, and long credit;" [...] but she was out of her depth in five minutes, and dared say nothing, lest she should betray her lamentable ignorance on all matters of business. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scrape by cleverly turning the conversation to old times, and youthful reminiscences soon absorbed them both.|$|E
60|$|The {{knowledge}} {{sank into}} her like ice. Then deliberately <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and went across to him. He was horrible and frightening, {{but he was}} warm. She felt his power and his warmth invade her and extinguish her. The mad and desperate passion that was in him sent her completely unconscious again, completely unconscious.|$|R
60|$|The fourteenth of February in London {{was quite}} as black, and cold, and as wintersome {{as it was}} at Allington, and was, perhaps, {{somewhat}} more melancholy in its coldness. Nevertheless Lady Alexandrina de Courcy looked as bright as bridal finery could make her, when <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her carriage and walked into St. James's church at eleven o'clock on that morning.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2012 <b>she</b> has <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> playing {{basketball}} and now working at Mastery Charter in South Philadelphia.|$|R
