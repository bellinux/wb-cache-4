5000|$|Power steering. Older {{hydraulic}} power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> or an electrically powered hydraulic pump.|$|E
50|$|Although these racing {{simulators}} {{are specifically}} built {{for people with}} a high grade of driving skill, {{it is not uncommon}} to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{for the design}} of a Steer-by-Wire (SbW) system a generic {{controller}} structure is proposed with bidirectional position feedback. The design goal for SbW here is to match the dynamics of an (electric or hydraulic power) steering system which may notionally be subdivided into a manual and an <b>assistance</b> <b>steering</b> part. For matching the manual steering part a generic linear controller structure and for matching the <b>assistance</b> <b>steering</b> part a nonlinear unilateral controller structure are suggested. The controller design problem is formulated as a system dynamics equivalence problem, either based on a physical or an identified model, and is solved exactly. This result is then adapted according to practical considerations. For robustness and stability analysis of the linear part of the steer-by-wire system passivity theory is applied and performance is evaluated by Bode magnitude plots and a H?-performance criterion. Nonlinear simulations at various operating conditions (vehicle speed, road-tire contact) with a high fidelity vehicle dynamics model demonstrate the robustness of the whole system...|$|R

5000|$|Distronic Plus with Steering Assist: This radar-based {{function}} has {{now been}} enhanced {{by the addition of}} Steering Assist, which helps drivers to stay centred in their lane by generating the appropriate steering torque when travelling on a straight road and even in gentle bends. The stereo camera recognises lane markings as well as vehicles driving ahead together with their three-dimensional positioning, and relays this information to the electric <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> system. When driving at slow speeds, e.g. in congested traffic, Steering Assist can use the vehicle ahead as a means of orientation, enabling semi-autonomous following even when there are no clear lane markings visible. As a result, the system is able to further enhance driving comfort and substantially ease the driver's workload in many traffic situations. DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist can be activated as before with a lever on the steering column in a speed range from 0 - 200 km/h. Any speed between 30 km/h and 200 km/h can be selected as the desired cruising speed. Drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times even when Steering Assist is activated, as the function only works in bends above a certain, speed-dependent radius.|$|E

The benefit of the method within a driver assistance system would be twofold. Firstly, unavoidable accidents could be detected and appropriate actions like full braking maneuvers could be initiated in due course. Secondly, {{in case of an}} avoidable accident the algorithm is able to suggest an evasion trajectory that could be tracked by a future active <b>steering</b> driver <b>assistance</b> system. The algorithm exploits numerical optimal control techniques and reachable set analysis. A parametric sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the influence of inaccurate sensor measurements...|$|R
40|$|Yaw {{and roll}} {{dynamics}} of vehicles {{can be controlled}} efficiently by individual wheel braking or by active steering. Both approaches are compared {{on the basis of}} physical and application considerations. Two vehicle dynamics control concepts based on active steering are summarized. One of them focusses on the attenuation of yaw disturbances on the vehicle by robust unilateral decoupling of yaw and lateral mode. The other approach aims at rollover avoidance of road vehicles. There, in continuous operation, active steering improves the roll dynamics. In case of emergency an efficient strategy applies simultaneous steering and braking control. 1 Efficiency of braking and <b>steering</b> Driver <b>assistance</b> systems for vehicle dynamics primarily produce a compensating torque for yaw disturbances.

40|$|<b>Steering</b> and evasion <b>{{assistance}}</b> {{defines a}} new and future class of driver assistance systems to avoid an impending collision with other traffic participants. Dynamic and kinematic considerations reveal that an evasive steering maneuver has high potential for collision avoidance in many driving situations. Three different system layouts are described: driver-initiated evasion, corrective evasion, and automatic evasion assistance. Since an automatic steering intervention is a challenging and responsible task, the technological requirements for situation analysis and environment perception are stated. Many technical solutions for a steering intervention are conceivable; therefore several actuator concepts are discussed and assessed with respect to human machine interface (HMI) impacts. A short survey of research activities of industry and academia is given. As an example for a research level prototype, the Daimler automatic evasion assistance system for pedestrian protection is presented in detail. Based on binocular stereo vision, crossing pedestrians are detected by fusion of a pedestrian classification module with a 6 D-Vision moving object detection module. Time-To-X criticality measures are used for situation analysis and prediction {{as well as for}} maneuver decision. Tested on a proving ground, the prototype system is able to decide within {{a fraction of a second}} whether to perform automatic braking or evasive steering, at vehicle speeds of urban traffic environment. By this it is shown that automatic <b>steering</b> and evasion <b>assistance</b> comes to reality and will be introduced stepwise to the market...|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the straight ahead position when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{frequent}} causes of highway accidents is the unintended out of lane deviation, due to moments of inattention, sleepiness or drowsiness. The enclosed video shows a driver <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> that prevents this type of lane departure.

40|$|International audienceWithin {{the context}} of more and more {{autonomous}} vehicles, an automatic lateral control device (AS: Automatic Steering) was used to steer the vehicle along the road without drivers’ intervention. The device {{was not able to}} detect and avoid obstacles. The experiment aimed to analyse unexpected obstacle avoidance manoeuvres when lateral control was delegated to automation. It was hypothesized that drivers skirting behaviours and eye movement patterns would be modified with automated steering compared with a control situation without automation. Eighteen participants took part in a driving simulator study. Steering behaviours and eye movements were analysed during obstacle avoidance episodes. Compared with driving without automation, skirting around obstacles was found to be less effective when drivers had to return from automatic steering to manual control. Eye movements were modified in the presence of automatic steering, revealing further ahead visual scanning of the driving environment. Resuming manual control is not only a problem of action performance but is also related to the reorganisation of drivers’ visual strategies linked to drivers’ disengagement from the <b>steering</b> task. <b>Assistance</b> designers should pay particular attention to potential changes in drivers’ activity when carrying out development work on highly automated vehicles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLane {{departure}} avoidance systems assist actively {{the driver}} during inattention or drowsiness and increase driving safety. Most {{of the lane}} departure avoidance systems use for the lateral control of the vehicle in closed loop a DC motor similar to the electrical powered <b>steering</b> (EPS) <b>assistance.</b> Important difficulties and limits of this approach are the shared control with the driver {{on the steering wheel}} and the vehicle handling at limits. In this paper a combined lateral control using a DC motor on the steering wheel and the differential braking control is investigated to keep the vehicle on the lane. The main objective is to develop lateral control laws which allow a repartition of the control effort in real time between the steering by the steering angle and the steering by the differential braking. This could facilitate a better interaction with the driver and avoid for instance tires saturation, steering angle saturation or excessive lateral accelerations. A joint design of the steering angle control and of the lateral control by differential braking is ensured by minimizing the vehicle reachability set. This is achieved by means of a quadratic Lyapunov function and LMI methods. Preliminary simulation results illustrate the approach and show a very good performance to avoid the lane departure even during curve negotiation...|$|R

This paper presents the design and experimental test of an active <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> system that offers two functions: lane departure avoidance by temporary activation and maintaining vehicle heading by permanent activation. Each of the two functions can be used exclusively or in combination. Specific constraints related to each of the two functions are taken into account in the control design of the <b>steering</b> <b>assistance</b> by using LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) and BMI (Bilinear Matrix Inequality) optimization methods. Consequently, lane overshoot is minimized for assistance activations near the border of the lane even during curve negotiation and robust lane keeping is ensured.

The results are verified using a fully-equipped prototype vehicle. The obtained field test is consistent with the expected performance...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous route {{following}} with {{road vehicles}} has gained {{popularity in the}} last few decades. In order to provide highly automated driver assistance systems, different types and combinations of sensors have been presented in the literature. However, most of these approaches apply quite sophisticated and expensive sensors, and hence, the development of a cost-efficient solution still remains a challenging problem. This work proposes the use of a single monocular camera sensor for an automatic <b>steering</b> control, speed <b>assistance</b> for the driver and localization of the vehicle on a road. Herein, we assume that the vehicle is mainly traveling along a predefined path, such as in public transport. A computer vision approach is presented to detect a line painted on the road, which defines the path to follow. Visual markers with a special design painted on the road provide information to localize the vehicle and to assist in its speed control. Furthermore, a vision-based control system, which keeps the vehicle on the predefined path under inner-city speed constraints, is also presented. Real driving tests with a commercial car on a closed circuit finally prove the applicability of the derived approach. In these tests, the car reached a maximum speed of 48 km/h and successfully traveled a distance of 7 km without the intervention of a human driver and any interruption...|$|R
