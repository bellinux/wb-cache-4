5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park {{hosted a}} Great Fair {{in the summer}} of 1814 to {{celebrate}} the Allied sovereigns' visit to England, and exhibited various stalls and shows. The Battle of Trafalgar was re-enacted on the Serpentine, with a band playing the National Anthem while the French fleet <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake. The coronation of King George IV in 1821 was celebrated with a fair in the park, including an air balloon and firework displays.|$|E

5|$|Three dams {{were built}} {{from the island}} to the mainland. The center dam divided the dock area in half, another was further west and a third dam {{extended}} east across {{what would be the}} entrance. The two outer dams completely closed off the site from the sea. The center dam was built without much difficulty by simply tipping material to form an embankment, although some of the earth <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mud, so more had to be added.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E

5|$|Rhinogradentia is {{a fictitious}} order of mammal invented by German {{zoologist}} Gerolf Steiner. Members of the order, known as rhinogrades or snouters, {{are characterized by}} a nose-like feature called a nasorium, which evolved to fulfill {{a wide variety of}} functions in different species. Steiner also created a fictional persona, naturalist Harald Stümpke, who is credited as author of the 1957 book Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia (translated into English in 1967 as The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades). According to Steiner, it is the only remaining record of the animals, which were wiped out, along with all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, when the small Pacific archipelago they inhabited <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean due to nearby atomic bomb testing.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the geochemical signature of the lavas present on Iceland and in the north Atlantic. The resulting picture is consistent in several important respects. For instance, it is not contested {{that the source of}} the volcanism in the mantle is chemically and petrologically heterogeneous: it contains not only normal peridotite, but also eclogite – a fertile rock originating from subducted slabs – both of which contribute to the melts. The origin of the latter is assumed to be metamorphosed, very old oceanic crust which <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mantle several hundreds of millions of years ago during the subduction of an ocean, then upwelled from deep within the mantle.|$|E
25|$|It {{was against}} {{regulations}} for officers {{to drive a}} convoy vehicle, but First Lieutenant Ben Keating took the wheel while returning an armored supply truck to the Naray FOB. He wanted to avoid risking {{the lives of his}} men while traveling on an unstable road subject to ambush with an overweight vehicle. During the highly risky convoy, the road collapsed under the weight of Keating's vehicle. He was thrown from the truck and it rolled over him and <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Landay-Sin river. His death had a traumatic effect on the morale of 3-71 Cav. The Allies stopped using the Kamdesh-Naray road as a result.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was originally}} constructed in 1818 {{becoming one of}} the first to be built by the United States on the Great Lakes. The tower was replaced in 1851 for the first time; in 1858, due to its poor foundations and soil quality, it <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. The current structure was built in 1867 and remained in service until 1880. It was reactivated five years later before being permanently decommissioned in 1899. Both the lenses and lantern were eventually removed. The Erie Land Light was sold to the city of Erie in 1934 and was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1936. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to <b>sink</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|R

The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|chapter=1975 'Capitalism is on the run'}} In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these income tax rebates {{as part of the}} Tax Reduction Act of 1975. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7billion for 1976.|$|E
25|$|Loch Vennachar was {{considered}} an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892. Around 8pm on 3 June, the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened. At approximately 5.00am as darkness lifted it showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the vessel, lashed by the North-East gale. Two large waves approached the ship. Loch Vennachar rode the first wave and <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trough at the other side. While in this position, the second wave came on and broke on deck {{with such force that}} it broke the foremast, mainmast and the mizzen topmast. Without her masts to steady her, the Loch Vennachar rolled dangerously in heavy seas. After 9 days, the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged mizzen. After 5 weeks of sailing, she arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius. Although her stay lasted 5 months while new spars were sent from England, repairs only took 10 days to complete. Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea.|$|E
