25|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as l'Horloge à pendule & à secondes (clock with pendulum and <b>seconds</b> <b>hand)</b> in 1752, {{after he had}} observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille Latinised the name to Horologium on his 1763 chart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have already}} told you of the {{sickness}} and confusion that comes with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself {{to look at the}} dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> of a watch--into futurity.|$|E
50|$|Initially center seconds {{hands were}} driven off the third wheel, {{sometimes}} via an intermediate wheel, with the gearing {{on the outside}} of the top plate. This method of driving the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> is called indirect center seconds. Because the gearing was outside the plates, it added to the thickness of the movement, and because the rotation of the third wheel had to be geared up to turn the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> once a minute, the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> had a fluttering motion.|$|E
40|$|The <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> concept {{indicates}} {{a growing trend}} in clothing recently, leading to growing numbers of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> shops and developments of new <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> retail forms. This paper concentrates on the current <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market for fashion products and presents the different motives toward <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> consumption as well as alternative consumption channels for <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products. The findings of the paper are founded on literature research of academic articles and case studies. Results {{show that there is}} a high potential for the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market due to the increasing interest of consumers in buying <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products. The paper concentrates on the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market for fashion products in the western society. This means that there was no research on <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products for disadvantaged people in poor countries. Furthermore, the paper focuses the formal <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> retail channels to see what is already on the market...|$|R

5000|$|Rattrapante, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "double chronograph", have multiple <b>second</b> <b>hands,</b> {{at least one}} of which can be stopped and started independently.

5000|$|If the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> is co-axial {{with the}} minute and hour hand, {{that is it}} is pivoted {{at the center of}} the dial, this {{arrangement}} is called [...] "center seconds" [...] or [...] "sweep seconds", because the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> sweeps around the minute track on the dial.|$|E

50|$|The floral {{clock was}} {{the first of its kind}} in the state. It {{consists}} of an hour, minute and <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> that move on the 20 ft diameter dial. The machinery moving the clock is underground, giving the clock a natural look.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of most Rolex watches, {{like the}} <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of any watch with a {{mechanical}} [...] movement, moves in intervals measuring {{a fraction of}} a second, such that the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> appears to [...] "sweep." [...] The <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of a watch with a quartz movement, on the other hand, moves in one second intervals, such that the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> [...] "ticks." [...] Although this feature is not unique to Rolex watches, some call it the [...] "Rolex sweep." [...] Rolex did at one time produce watches with quartz movements, so the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of some Rolex watches moves in one second intervals. Rolex also gave Skepta a free Rolex Submariner for the promotion.|$|R

50|$|Early clock dials did not {{indicate}} minutes and seconds. A clock with a dial indicating minutes was illustrated in a 1475 manuscript by Paulus Almanus, and some 15th-century clocks in Germany indicated minutes and seconds.An early record of a <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> on a clock dates back to about 1560 on a clock now in the Fremersdorf collection.|$|E
50|$|The center wheel {{drives the}} pinion {{of the third}} wheel, and the third wheel drives the pinion of the fourth wheel. In watches with the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> in a {{subsidiary}} seconds dial, usually located above the 6 o'clock position, the fourth wheel is geared to rotate once per minute, and the second hand is attached directly to the arbour of this wheel.|$|E
50|$|Later, the chronographs gained {{their current}} form. In 1934 the Breitling chronographs {{received}} the second chronograph button with {{the function of}} returning the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> to zero. Thus it became possible to measure short intervals of time using the add function. However the patent of the flyback chronograph belongs to Longines with its first flyback chronograph dating back to 1936.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} some {{practices and}} aspects of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> cultures, that allow {{to develop new}} insights around the chain of production- consumption. First, these worlds destabilize the basic assumption that only new things are produced and bought. Second, the market of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> frequently involves consumers in additional work. In short, <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> goods exist {{in relation to a}} production that is mediately by the first cycle of consumption and are intrinsically connected to practices that reveal the work of consumption. Then, the paper analyzes the fashion of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> like a typical case of reusing practises. The success of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> fashion involves very different reasons like straitened circumstances, environmental sensibility, temperance, cool stylish research...|$|R

5000|$|... 1912: Gallet {{creates the}} first {{wristwatch}} for mass distribution {{to include a}} full-sized constant <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> originating {{from the center of}} the dial (face). This innovation proved useful for timing tasks that emphasized seconds over minutes and hours, including the measuring of the human heart rate. Gallet’s new “sweep second” wristwatches were issued to military nurses and medics during World War I.|$|E
5000|$|In 1915, Gaston Breitling {{produced}} the first chronograph {{with a central}} <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> and a 30-minute counter. Later, in 1923, Gaston Breitling introduced the first chronograph with a separate pusher at 2 o'clock. In 1934 Willy Breitling further developed {{the concept of the}} chronograph with the addition of the second pusher at 4 o'clock. Since then the 3-pusher chronograph design has been adopted by the entire industry.|$|E
50|$|Omegamatic used Omega caliber 1400 (ETA 205.111 Rhodium plated), 17 jewel autoquartz (not thermocompensated) {{movement}} with around 100 hours power reserve. This caliber has {{the option of}} manual winding to get the initial power to the capacitor. The mechanism alerts low power reserve by moving the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> in four seconds intervals. The Omega 1400 caliber has a slow date change, which usually takes approximately 1.5 hours to change over.|$|E

Firstly, the paper focuses on the arrival of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes during the past century in countries of Cape Verde, Ivory Coast and Senegal. Secondly, the paper presents big traders and detailers in that sector. Most of them are foreigners. Thirdly, through the places of capital cities where <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes are sold, we try to explain again the notion of second-hand and what productions in African cities are possible. <b>Second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes, urban planning, Abidjan, Dakar, Praia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Second</b> <b>hand</b> {{storage devices}} can be {{treasure}} troves of confidential data. This {{study investigated the}} remnant data on <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> memory cards that were purchased through Australian <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> auction websites throughout 2013. Memory cards continue to increase in capacity and are used in both smart phones and tablet computers as persistent storage. During this study a total of 140 <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> memory cards were purchased throughout 2013. Each memory card had its data recovered and subsequently analysed. The results show that sellers are sending memory cards with no evidence of erasure; poor attempts to erase data; or simply asking the buyer to erase the data prior to use. The data recovered is not only of a personal nature, but also appears to originate from Australian government departments and business. It is evident that actions must be taken by <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> auction sites, and the media to raise awareness and educate end users on how to dispose of data in an appropriate manner...|$|R

50|$|In 1948 Zenith {{introduced}} a watch with a redesigned gear train where the fourth wheel {{was at the}} center of the movement, and so could drive a center <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> directly. The minute wheel, which had previously been at the center of the movement, was moved off center and drove the minute wheel indirectly. Any fluttering due the indirect gearing is concealed by the relatively slow movement of the minute hand. This redesign brought all the train gearing between the plates and allowed a thinner movement.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{improper}} hand setting, manually moving the hour or <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> {{rather than the}} minute hand {{in an attempt to}} set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning. Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, “Rather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Say in this example, Worm {{decides to}} use the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of his watch to {{determine}} when to bluff (50% of the time). If the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of the watch is between 1 and 30 seconds, Worm will check his hand down (not bluff). If the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> of the watch is between 31 and 60 seconds, Worm will bluff his hand. Worm {{looks down at his}} watch, and the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> is at 45 seconds, so Worm decides to bluff. Mike folds his two pair saying, [...] "the way you've been betting your hand, I don't think my two pair on the board will hold up against your hand."

40|$|The <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> {{and vintage}} clothes market is {{increasing}} and the attitude and {{perception of the}} clothes are changing. Demographic age groups are important driving forces for change of attitudes and values. The purpose of the thesis {{is to get a}} better understanding of the MeWe generation, people born in the mid 80 ’s, as a driving force behind the increasing interest in second hand/vintage clothes. In this thesis their values are connected with their attitudes and motivations towards <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage clothes consumption. Qualitative method has been used and interviews with five representatives of the MeWe generation have been conducted. As a theoretical framework the survey of the MeWe generation by Lindgren et al is used along with research about <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage clothes. The conclusion of the thesis is that the MeWe generation can be considered to be an important driving force behind the growing <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage market. Their attitudes towards <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes can be explained by their values. In this thesis the concepts of individuality, authenticity and post-materialism is in focus. They are important traits of the MeWe generation and can be used to explain the shifting perception of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes and the growing market...|$|R
50|$|The telemeter {{chronograph}} is {{a feature}} of a wristwatch, which allows the user to approximately measure the distance to an event that can be both seen and heard (e.g. a lightning bolt or a torpedo strike) using the speed of sound. The user starts the chronograph (stopwatch) at the instant the event is seen, and stops timing at the instant the event is heard. The <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> will point to the distance measured on a scale, usually {{around the edge of}} the face. The scale can be defined in any unit of distance, but miles or kilometers are most practical and commonplace.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 Fullspot {{released}} a pocket watch {{calling it the}} O chive. This maintains the minimalist design of the O clock range with a plain white face and {{the inclusion of a}} <b>seconds</b> <b>hand.</b> The O chive is made of soft touch plastic shell and a white matt varnished metal chain and clip. There were originally 10 colours [...] but the three 80' clock colours were added bringing the total to 13. The plastic shell can be removed and replaced with another colour much like the O clock faces. The packaging is based on a shoe polish container.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{its unique}} {{features}} {{is a true}} continuously sweeping second hand, instead of the traditional beats per time unit as seen with traditional mechanical and most quartz watches. Most quartz watches are electronically regulated to a single [...] "tick" [...] per second to conserve battery life. The original Bulova Accutron tuning fork models featured a near continuous moving <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> (oscillating {{at a rate of}} 360 Hz equivalent to a stunning mechanical rate of 2,592,000 bph) whereas their contemporary ultra-high frequency and Precisionist quartz movements are regulated at high rates (as many as 16 beats per second) to give the illusion of continuous movement.|$|E
