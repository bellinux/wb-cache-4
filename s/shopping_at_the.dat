5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

In one early action, Talen and his {{associates}} pretended to be <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> store and talking on non-functional cell phones, carrying on increasingly loud conversations about the evils of Disney and its products. Once the ruse was discovered, Reverend Billy began preaching to the actual consumers until the police removed him from the store.|$|E

25|$|In September 1920, the Seattle City Council quietly {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} that farmer's stalls at the Market {{could no longer}} be placed in the street, in response to complaints from some local businesses about traffic flow. A public outcry immediately followed from the farmers, merchants, and various citizen's groups. Visiting celebrities even {{played a role in the}} public debate, such as a member of New York City's Tiffany family <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Market, gaining the farmers favorable press coverage. In the midst of the turmoil, the Westlake Market Company pushed itself into the situation, proposing that they would build a two-floor underground market at a building they owned on Fifth Avenue, four blocks from the existing Pike Place Market. The Goodwins, in response, proposed another counter-plan to leverage insurance bonds to finance another further expansion of the Market. As the city government began to quickly lean towards the Westlake proposal, the farmers began to formally organize together for the first time to protect their interests. The deciding Seattle City Council vote in April 1921 was in favor of retaining the existing Market location, and the Goodwins immediately began work on their next expansions.|$|E
25|$|Tijuana also {{relies on}} tourism {{for a major}} part of its revenue. About 300,000 {{visitors}} cross by foot or car from the San Ysidro point of entry in the United States every day. To lessen the strain on the border crossing, the Otay Mesa Crossing has been boosted to support more traffic and 6-lane highway 905 built in 2012, as well as rapid bus transit coming in the future. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs, and shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are part of the draw for the city's tourists, many located {{within walking distance of the}} border. The city's tourist centers include Downtown Tijuana including the nightlife hot spots around , Avenida Revolucion, souvenir <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mercado de Artesanías and Plaza Viva Tijuana, Tijuana's Cultural Center (CECUT) and neighboring Plaza Río Tijuana shopping center, and the city's best known vices, in the form of its legal Red Light District and gambling (Agua Caliente). Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay on Avenida Revolución. Tijuana is also home to several pharmacies marketed toward visitors from the United States, which sell some medicines without prescriptions and at much lower costs than in the US. Many medications still require a Mexican doctor's prescriptions, available from adjacent doctors' offices. Businesses such as auto detailing, medical services, dentistry and plastic surgery are heavily marketed and are usually cheaper than in the U.S.|$|E

500|$|Many of Springfield's {{residents}} purchase [...] "Juice Looseners" [...] {{through the}} mail, which are inefficient and loud juicers built in Japan and shipped from there. One {{of the assembly}} line workers has the flu and coughs into the box destined for Homer, filling it with airborne germs. When the Juice Looseners arrive in Springfield, the dreaded Osaka Flu hits the town {{and many of the}} townspeople are affected by the illness. Due to exhaustion from having to look after the rest of her ill family, Marge accidentally forgets to pay for Grampa's bottle of bourbon when <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kwik-E-Mart. She is then arrested for shoplifting. Chief Wiggum tells Mayor Quimby about the arrest in confidence, and Mayor Quimby later reveals this fact to everyone in town during a public address. Marge's reputation is lowered dramatically among the townspeople, who now distrust her around their possessions. The family hires Lionel Hutz to defend Marge at her trial, but Hutz loses the case and the jury finds Marge guilty. She is sentenced to 30 days imprisonment at Springfield Women's Prison.|$|E

Avşar arranged {{for her to}} meet Sezen Aksu, who would eventually invite her to audition {{to work with her}} on her upcoming album. Aksu hired her as her assistant and as back vocalist for her album [...] "Deli Kızın Türküsü" [...] (Folk Songs of a Crazy Girl). This gave her the first stepping stone into the music industry, as working with Aksu allowed her not only to gain some experience as an artist, but also contribute to the production of some of Aksu's albums during the 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|As a detective, Seedman {{was known}} for his unorthodox {{approaches}} that solved otherwise perplexing cases. [...] "I try to imagine who was in a room the second before the murder," [...] he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed an empty chair next to the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat there watching the traffic go by. Although he normally was out <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Seedman insisted on entering the man's apartment through a window—where he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him.|$|E
2500|$|Dividend Miles was US Airways Group's frequent-flyer program. Members earned {{one mile}} for every mile flown on US Airways on any {{published}} fare – paid flights taken in First Class or Envoy received a 50% mileage bonus. Members also earned miles on flights on partner airlines and for partner hotel stays, car rentals, <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dividend Miles mall and for purchases {{made with a}} US Airways credit card. Miles could be redeemed for free flights, upgrades and more. Dividend Miles was to be absorbed into American Airlines's AAdvantage program {{in the second quarter}} of 2015. However, American Airlines announced on March 13, 2015, that Dividend Miles would be merged into American's AAdvantage program [...] "within the next 30 days". On March 24, 2015, it was confirmed that Dividend Miles would be absorbed into American's AAdvantage program on March 28, 2015. On March 28, 2015, Dividend Miles was officially absorbed into American Airlines's AAdvantage program.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{after the}} police {{investigation}} concluded, Lieberman filed a court petition in New York County Surrogate's Court, which handles probate matters, {{to have his}} wife declared {{a victim of the}} attacks regardless of what the police had said. New York state law requires [...] "clear and convincing" [...] evidence of a possible victim's exposure to any lethal peril in order for any presumption of death and subsequent legal provisions, including benefits from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, to apply. He believed that his wife's profession would have led her to rush to the nearby World Trade Center, if she was in the vicinity, and offer aid to victims. Her mother further testified to their online chat, in which she {{said she was going to}} check out Windows on the World and possibly do some <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Trade Center's mall. The author of the police report testified that he believed Philip probably died in the attacks.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{the liberal}} {{fulfilment}} of their promise {{in the new}} house in the suburbs blinded the young girls' eyes to their shortcomings in the town. Their own remoteness and elevation above its feverish life kept them from the knowledge of much that was strange, and perhaps disturbing to their equanimity. As they did not mix with the immigrant women--Miss Jessie's good-natured intrusion into one of their half-nomadic camps one day having been met with rudeness and suspicion--they gradually fell into the way of trusting the responsibility of new acquaintances to {{the hands of their}} original hosts, and of consulting them in the matter of local recreation. It thus occurred that one day the two girls, {{on their way to the}} main street for an hour's <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Villa de Paris and Variety Store, were stopped by Dick Mattingly a few yards from their house, with the remark that, as the county election was then in progress, it would be advisable for them to defer their intention for a few hours. As he did not deem it necessary to add that two citizens, in the exercise of a freeman's franchise, had been supplementing their ballots with bullets, in front of an admiring crowd, they knew nothing of that accident that removed from Devil's Ford an entertaining stranger, who had only the night before partaken of their hospitality.|$|E
6000|$|The process {{still goes}} on, and {{there can be}} little doubt of the {{ultimate}} issue. The old small manufacturers are either ruined or driven into sweating and the slums; the old coaching innkeeper and common carrier have been impoverished or altogether superseded by the railways and big carrier companies; the once flourishing shopkeeper lives to-day on the mere remnants of the trade that great distributing stores or the branches of great companies have left him. Tea companies, provision-dealing companies, tobacconist companies, make the position of the old-established private shop unstable and the chances of the new beginner hopeless. Railways and tramways take the custom more and more effectually past the door of the small draper and outfitter to the well-stocked establishments at the centre of things; telephone and telegraph assist that <b>shopping</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre more and more. The small [...] "middle-class" [...] school-master finds himself beaten by revived endowed schools and by new public endowments; the small doctor, the local dentist, find Harley Street always nearer to them and practitioners in motor-cars from the great centres playing havoc with their practices. And while the small men are more and more distressed, the great organizations of trade, of production, of public science, continue to grow and coalesce, until at last they grow into national or even world trusts, or into publicly-owned monopolies. In America slaughtering and selling meat has grown into a trust, steel and iron are trustified, mineral oil is all gathered into a few hands. All through the trades and professions and sciences and all over the world the big eats up the small, the new enlarged scale replaces the old.|$|E
