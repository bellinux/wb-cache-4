40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to formulate a management system for improving early Quebec tomato yields through the use of polyethylene row tunnels and the screening of three tomato genotypes for their performance under a tunnel system of growing. Three tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cultivars, <b>Springset</b> (early, cold-tolerant), Celebrity (standard), and Hope No. 1 (early, heat-tolerant), were grown under clear or white perforated polyethylene row tunnels that were either vented ten days prior to anthesis to maintain temperatures below 30 $ sp circ$C or nonvented. Controls had no tunnel treatment. <b>Springset</b> had the highest harvest index and subsequent highest early yield. Celebrity had the highest total yield. Hope was not suited to producing early yield under the frequent low temperature conditions occurring during the spring in Quebec. Tunnels did not improve early or total yield. Further research is required before tunnels can be recommended for producing early tomatoes in Quebec...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were established during the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons, {{to determine the}} effect of mini-tunnel management systems on floral development and fruit set of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Two types of floral abnormalities reported to be caused by temperatures above 30 $ sp circ$C were observed, namely: style exsertion and splitting of the antheridial cone. Clear vented and white non-vented mini-tunnels reduced the incidence of both these abnormalities compared to the controls in 1988. As a consequence these two types of mini-tunnels also had the greatest percentage fruit set and total marketable yield of the first three clusters. In 1989, none of the mini-tunnels tested significantly increased percentage fruit set or marketable yield. The cultivar <b>Springset</b> produced ripe fruits an average of 4 days before Hope# 1 and 7 days before Celebrity in both 1988 and 1989...|$|E
