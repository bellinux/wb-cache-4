5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E

25|$|Two detectives from RHD interrogated her {{the next}} month, July 2010. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> she was {{concerned}} that events leading to Lazarus's arrest {{in which she was}} involved had been portrayed differently in the media than she recalled them, putting the department in a more favorable light. Nuttall as well, she recalled, had been placed in an equally difficult position, since he told her that Lazarus may have learned that they had reopened the investigation despite the precautions he and Barba had taken.|$|E
25|$|In March she {{attended}} meetings in Elberfeld, Barmen, Wiesbaden, and then Darmstadt, where a large mixed meeting including {{women and girls}} was organized in the gymnasium. The audience had been told of the subject in advance, and listened quietly other than a few male hecklers at the front. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that the morality police were a source of difficulty for a young fallen woman who wanted to return to an honest life. At this, the police commissioner and his agents went {{up to her and}} demanded that she stop her speech, since it was immoral.|$|E
25|$|Once {{while serving}} as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a {{volunteer}} became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison {{was sure it was}} meningitis with life-threatening complications that could not be treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000. The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order, but <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> she did not need anyone's permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met {{two days}} after the murder with family members {{representing}} Sarowar and Runi, along with their son, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that she would see to it that their son would educated {{and there would be no}} impunity in the couple's case and justice would be quick. The Prime Minister later criticised journalists for carrying out demonstrations and at other times praised them for raising awareness. In a widely repeated quote in connection with the case, she said the government could not protect everyone by posting a guard outside their bedrooms. She also told party members that more journalists were killed when her political opponents were in power.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday night, April 13, Betty Jo Booker, age 15, {{was playing}} her alto {{saxophone}} in her regular weekly gig with her band, The Rythmaires, at the VFW Club at W. 4th and Oak Street. She did not finish until about 1:30a.m. Sunday. She {{waited for her}} friend since kindergarten, Paul Martin, age 16, to pick her up. Martin was in town after moving away to Kilgore two years prior. He had been with her earlier that day before the dance and was {{to take her to}} a slumber party across town. Booker's classmates said that earlier that day <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that {{she did not want to}} go out with Martin but felt obligated since he was an old friend.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 6, she complained to the police that, after a {{domestic}} dispute, her husband had taken their son from the marital residence, and when the police reached the Randolph house, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that her husband was}} a cocaine user whose drug use habit had caused the family financial troubles. She mentioned the marital problems, saying that she and their son had only recently returned after a several weeks' stay with her parents. Shortly after the policemen arrived, Scott Randolph returned, explaining to them that he had removed their son to a neighbor's house, worried that his wife might again take the boy out of the U.S.; Scott Randolph denied using cocaine, and countered that it was his wife, Janet, who used illegal drugs and abused alcohol.|$|E

25|$|George Orson Welles {{was born}} May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He {{was named after}} his {{paternal}} great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story {{of the source of}} his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), {{and the two of them}} sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her régime that the Pressler {{amendment}} came into effect, {{an attempt to}} freeze the programme. During frequent trips to the United States, Bhutto refused to compromise on the nuclear weapons programme, and attacked the Indian nuclear programme on multiple occasions. Benazir Bhutto misled the U.S. when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that the programme had been frozen; the programme was progressively modernized and continued under her watch. Under her regime, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) conducted series of improvised designs of nuclear weapons designed by the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) at PAEC. Benazir Bhutto also carried messages to Munir Ahmad Khan from her father and back in 1979 as her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had instructed his daughter to remain {{in touch with the}} Chairman of PAEC. In this context, Bhutto had appointed Munir Ahmad Khan as her Science Adviser, and he kept her informed about the development of the programme. In all, the nuclear weapons and energy program remained a top priority, along with the country's economy. During her first term, the nuclear program was under attack and under pressure from the Western world, particularly the United States. Despite economic aid offered by the European Union and the United States in return for halting or freezing the program, Benazir continued the program in both her first and second terms.|$|E
50|$|Later on, Maria asks Cesare for his help. She {{is dying}} in a hospital, but cannot tell her parents, because, some time earlier, <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> was married.

25|$|Rahab {{promptly}} {{went up to}} the spies on {{the roof}} and told them that she knew that God had given the Israelites the land, and that the people lived in terror of the Israelites, having heard how God dried up the Red Sea before them and how the Israelites had destroyed the forces of Sihon and Og. So Rahab asked the spies to swear by God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house and give her a token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She let them down by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, Kathy {{has escaped}} Gavin, and she {{contacts}} her old friend Tracey (Jane Slaughter), at The Queen Vic, giving her {{an address to}} pass on to Phil. Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England.

Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian.

Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> everything and they are looking for Gavin. She then secretly meets Gavin who reminds her of their plan.|$|E
