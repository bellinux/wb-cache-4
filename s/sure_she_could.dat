25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E
500|$|Before filming began, {{several of}} the main cast members were sent to a boot camp in South Africa and went through {{intensive}} and rigorous military training by former SAS and SBS soldiers. Stapleton and Winchester had more training than Birthistle, who {{just wanted to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> at least be a believable soldier. The actors were trained in several aspects including running, teamwork, and weapons. Mealing meanwhile, did not go through as much training as the other actors, but did spend mornings training with a commander for the SBS who is also a military adviser on the show. Winchester recalled, [...] "Sully and I would meet every morning at 6am. We would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and then our trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the licence plate number?' Our trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone. At the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do feel <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear more now," [...] said Rosamond, eagerly. [...] "It {{would be}} such a thing if she could only be moved about that down-stairs floor." ...|$|E
60|$|Honora was <b>sure</b> as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be that Chiltern was angry, {{although}} he gave no visible sign of this. It {{was as though}} the current ran from his arm into hers.|$|R
6000|$|John {{could hold}} his tongue this time. [...] "And you came {{all this way}} by night, twenty miles and odd, to warn Captain Carbonel, on your aunt's information?" [...] said Sir Harry, thoughtfully. [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear distinctly?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she began}} {{to do this with}} the arts so {{imperceptible}} to the single-mindedness of a man, she was not yet <b>sure</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> endure to live with him or not; <b>she</b> was merely <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not live without him, or, to be more specific, without his genius, which she believed no one else appreciated as she did. She believed that she understood his character better than any one else, and would know how to supplement it with her own. She had no ambition herself, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lend him a more telescopic vision in his, and keep his aims high, if his self-concentration ever made him short-sighted. He would write plays because he could not help it, but she would inspire him to write them with the lofty sense of duty she would have felt in writing them if she had his gifts.|$|R
60|$|Janet, cold {{with horror}} and remorse, dragged {{herself up to}} the window again and listened. She must know--she must be <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hear only a word here and there, but that word was enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must talk to Graillot," [...] she said. [...] "There is {{a little}} Frenchwoman over here now. I once saw her act in Paris, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play Thérèse wonderfully. But don't let's talk seriously any longer. Just let us sit here and talk nonsense!" ...|$|E
60|$|But since Mamma Tone {{had gone}} away the old life had lost its charm and become dull and stupid. Lory was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be happier elsewhere, but her crushed and dispirited nature responded to the {{suggestion}} of change. It was interesting to have something different to look forward to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did 'ee do ut really now, Master Clive?" [...] cries Mrs. Honeyman's attendant, {{grinning}} {{with the}} utmost good-humour. [...] "Well, she be as pretty a young lady as ever I saw; and as I told my missis, 'Miss Martha,' says I, 'there's a pair on 'em.' Though missis was mortal angry to be <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> never <b>could</b> bear it." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so the two}} walked {{together}} through the dark alley {{to the end of}} the rickety, dismantled dock; the one thinking of the vast reward the King would lavish upon her for the information <b>she</b> felt <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> alone <b>could</b> give; the other feeling beneath his mantle for the hilt of a long dagger which nestled there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wrote and}} told her," [...] Mrs. Willet began. [...] "After all, though," [...] {{she went on}} thoughtfully, [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have had the letter. But if she went up to Hampstead, any one would tell her where I had moved to. There's no secret about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He might deny it, {{but it was}} true. Ah, Tommy, you bore {{with her}} with {{infinite}} patience, but did it never strike you that she kept you to the earth? If Elspeth could be happy without you! You were <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not, but if she could!--had that thought never made you flap your wings? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} make talk about other things. She responded vaguely, and when she had given herself time she said she {{believed}} {{she would go to}} Lottie; she was quite <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get down the stairs alone. He pursued her anxiously, politely, and at the head of her corridor took leave of her with a distinct sense of having merited his dismissal.|$|E
6000|$|Carley {{did not ask}} {{any more}} questions. Natural history was not her {{favorite}} study and she was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dispense with any first-hand knowledge of desert beasts. She thought, however, she heard {{one of the men}} say, [...] "Big varmint prowlin' round the sheep." [...] To which Hutter replied, [...] "Reckon it was a bear." [...] And Glenn said, [...] "I saw his fresh track by the lake. Some bear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I see, and it is for that reason I come to you. I could not be always on the watch, but I think that you and I {{together}} would keep so sharp a look-out that we might feel pretty <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not get away without our knowledge." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{knew the}} various {{expressions}} of my sweet girl's face so well, {{and it was}} such an honest face in its loveliness, that I was <b>sure</b> beforehand <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not hide that first look from me. And I considered whether, if it should signify any one of these meanings, which was so very likely, could I quite answer for myself? ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{she did not}} speak. There were {{a hundred}} things {{she wanted to say}} but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not say them. Did he mean that he loved her still? If <b>she</b> were <b>sure</b> of that, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> forgive him anything, but her doubt {{rendered}} her mute.|$|R
60|$|Her {{hand went}} {{out over the}} {{revolver}} toward his hand, as {{she pointed to the}} tell-tale yellow stain on his fingers. At the same time her eyes measured the nearness of her own hand and of his to the weapon. She ached to grip it in one swift movement. She was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do it, and yet she was not sure; {{and so it was that}} she refrained as she withdrew her hand.|$|E
6000|$|To be <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> talk to Mrs. Lacy, {{and tell}} her about Sylvia, and deliver {{opinions}} upon the characters in her histories and stories; but it often happened that the low grave [...] "Yes, my dear," [...] showed by the very tone that her governess had heard not a word; and at the best, it was dreary work to look up and discourse to nothing but the black crape veil that Mrs. Lacy always kept down.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would be}} a wretch else. I do not deny her attachment, but I only say it is nothing, {{it ought to be}} nothing, it can be nothing, it shall be nothing, {{compared}} to that of the one who first held you in her arms, and who has always held you in her heart. Mamerzelle can sleep such a night as this, which I'm <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do were she as much concerned for you as I am." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Phillips was an {{exceedingly}} bright and quick young woman, and I am quite <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{see into the}} state of a man's feelings {{as well as any}} one. Bertha had given me many instances of her maid's facilities for adapting herself to circumstances, and I was now thankful {{from the bottom of my}} heart that Bertha had this woman with her.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the latter had gone, however, that they remembered that they had {{forgotten}} to ask him whether he had heard anything of the woman Inez, who had been furnished with his address, but, as he had said nothing of her, they felt <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have arrived in Seville, and once more were much afraid as to what might have happened after they had left Granada.|$|R
50|$|While {{writing this}} last book in 1942 that she {{suffered}} an artistic crisis, after meeting a young pilot {{who told her}} that her books were soppy and her characters not realistic. He was <b>sure,</b> however, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> write something decent if she tried.|$|R
60|$|She had {{one great}} object in view which overshadowed {{everything}} else, {{and this was}} to marry Captain Asher. This she could have done before, she firmly believed, {{had it not been}} for her old father and that horrid girl, the captain's niece. As for the elderly man who kept the toll-gate she did not mind him. If not interfered with, she was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make him marry her, and then the great ambition of her life would be satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|Alice got up {{and when}} he rose said quietly, but with {{something}} in her voice that thrilled him: [...] "I think you like my mother and she knows I meant to talk to you. Lawrence is very dear to her and if he were dragged back into disgrace, now when {{we thought it was}} all forgotten and he has made a new start in Canada, I am not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear the shock. There is nobody else who could help us and we trust to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Cornelia had no {{grudge against}} {{him for the}} past. She was only too glad that it had all fallen out as it did; and though she still {{knew that he was}} a shameless little wretch, she did not feel so {{personally}} disgraced by him, as she had at first, when she was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make him keep his distance. He was a respite from her own thoughts, and she lingered and lingered, and listened and listened, remotely aware that it was wrong, but somehow bewildered and constrained.|$|E
5000|$|Pitt's {{credentials}} {{for writing}} about ghosts spring {{from a time}} when she lived with a tribe of Indians in Colorado. Sitting with her baby daughter, Steffanie, by a log fire, <b>she</b> was <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see the face of her father smiling at her in the flames. [...] "I told one of the others and he went all Hollywood Injun on me and said something like 'Heap good medicine'. I guess he was taking the mickey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{accomplished}} some good, however," [...] continued the girl. [...] "Ingua is much happier and more content. She is improving in her speech and manners and is growing ambitious {{to become a}} respectable and refined young lady. She doesn't often give way to temper, as she used to do on every occasion, and I am <b>sure</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be removed from her grandfather's evil influence she would soon develop {{in a way to}} surprise us all." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{retired in}} 1937 having {{gathered}} an important collection of algae. The Chair of the department, Professor Rosenthal, {{who had a}} vendetta running with Tilden, made <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not borrow any samples from the university's herbarium. But Tilden outwitted him. She appealed to the university's board who granted her request {{that she should be}} allowed to take her collection with her. The collection was installed on one floor of her new home in Florida and she used this to publish further research.|$|R
60|$|Fanny's joy {{was quite}} {{equal to that}} of her lover, but it was not shown quite so openly. Her aunt congratulated her most warmly; kissed her twenty times; called her her own dear, darling niece, and promised her to love her husband, and to make him a purse if she could get Griffiths to teach her that new stitch; it looked so easy she was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> learn it, and it wouldn't tease her eyes. Lady Selina also wished her joy; but she did it very coldly, though very sensibly.|$|E
60|$|When {{she heard}} this news, {{the old lady}} was amazed and indignant; and she soundly rated Molly for not coming to her instantly, before she left her place. Had she known {{of the state of}} affairs, she was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have pacified Miriam, and {{arranged}} for Molly to retain her place. It was very important for Miss Panney, though she did not say so, to have some one in the Cobhurst family who would keep her informed of what was happening there. If possible, Molly must go back; and anyway the old lady determined to go to Cobhurst and look into matters.|$|E
60|$|Finally, Mr. Harrison kept {{a parrot}} called Ginger. Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before; {{consequently}} that proceeding was considered barely respectable. And such a parrot! If you took John Henry Carter's word for it, never {{was such an}} unholy bird. It swore terribly. Mrs. Carter would have taken John Henry away at once {{if she had been}} <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get another place for him. Besides, Ginger had bitten a piece right {{out of the back of}} John Henry's neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage. Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays.|$|E
60|$|Corny {{was just}} as much in earnest as {{she was the first}} day we saw her, but she seemed to have grown more thoughtful. Perhaps this was on account of her having {{important}} business on hand. Her thoughtfulness, however, did not prevent her from saying some very funny things. She spoke first and did her thinking afterward. But she was a good girl, and I often wished my sister knew her. Helen was older, to be <b>sure,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have learned a great deal from Corny.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{was more}} deeply hurt and humiliated by her playwright's flight {{than by the}} {{apparent}} failure of the play, but the two experiences coming together fairly stunned her. To have the curtain go down on her final scenes to feeble and hesitating applause was a new and painful experience. Never since her first public reading had she failed to move and interest her audience. What had happened? What had so swiftly weakened her hold on her admirers? Up to that moment <b>she</b> had been <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make any character successful.|$|R
60|$|He flung {{down the}} jacket, and, striding away, disappeared, while Ida shivered as she glanced about her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer see}} the shelter she had left, and she stood alone {{in the midst of}} a {{tremendous}} desolation of rock and snow, with the valley yawning, a vast dusky pit, beneath her feet. It was appallingly lonely, and she was numb with cold, while, since <b>she</b> was <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not climb back to her companions unassisted, there was only one person on whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> rely, and that was the packer, who had insisted on her doing what he thought fit. When he came back she had put on the jacket, but he had sense enough to make no sign of having noticed it.|$|R
