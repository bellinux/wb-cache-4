Fresh, homogenized milk with 3, 3 % of milk fat was used for yoghurt production, with addition of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI® B 94, inulin and transglutaminase activated during 1 h 30 min at 55 °C. Enzyme inactivation was carried out by pasteurization of milk during 15 minutes at 85 °C. Control samples were prepared without addition of probiotic culture, inulin and transglutaminase. Physico-chemical parameters and sensory properties of produced set-style yoghurt have been determined. For reliable identification of probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI® B 94, isolated from the produced yoghurt, SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins and PCR with species specific primers for Bifidobacterium were carried out. It has been shown that produced set-style yoghurt with probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI® B 94, inulin and transglutaminase had higher firmness, less syneresis and better sensory properties than control yoghurt samples.

The firmness of <b>set</b> <b>yoghurts</b> was measured with a cone-penetrometer and the apparent viscosity with a Brookfield viscometer. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) was extracted by precipitation with ethanol. Supplementation of a proteolytic strain of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2501 or 2515 to ABT- 1 or ABT- 4 starter culture reduced the fermentation time in making yoghurt. Yoghurts made with ABT- 1 and ABT- 4 with added L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2501 fermented in the shortest time of 5 h and 33 min and 5 h and 8 min, respectively. Quantities of EPS extracted from the different yoghurt batches did not show any significant differences (P < 0. 222). In general, the firmness improved {{with the addition of}} the proteolytic strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Addition of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to ABT- 1 and ABT- 4 did not produce significant (P < 0. 001) improvement in firmness of yoghurt compared with the mix starter batches. Significant differences (P < 0. 001) were observed in the viscosity of yoghurts supplemented with different combinations of starter cultures. However, the amounts of EPS isolated from yoghurt cultures did not correlate with the viscosities of the yoghurts.

40|$|The Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) {{method was}} {{originally}} developed to extract volatile and semivolatile compounds from wastewater samples but {{has since been}} applied to flavour compounds in foods and beverages. Research using the HS-SPME in related areas such as cheese and skim milk powder {{has been carried out}} but, to date, no work has been done on yoghurt flavours. The main objective {{of this study was to}} devise a methodology for the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) technique to investigate and quantify six flavour analytes in natural, <b>set</b> <b>yoghurts</b> made from recombined milk. The relevant literature was reviewed and from it, a research proposal for this work on yoghurts was drawn. The first step in analysing and quantifying the yoghurt volatiles was to set up a working methodology for the HS-SPME method. The 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre was chosen along with 20 minutes being the optimum fibre adsorption time. General equipment, materials and methods used throughout this thesis are also detailed. The external standard (ES) method was used to calibrate the GC and quantify the analyte concentrations in this study. The internal standard (IS) method was not used as a quantitative tool in this study. Once the HS-SPME methodology had been set up for the analysis of yoghurts, the classical Static Headspace (SH) method was compared with the HS-SPME method for extraction efficiency. The results suggested that the two methods were complementary in that the SH method extracted the more volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, acetone and 2 -butanone) whereas, the HS-SPME method extracted the semi- to non-volatile compounds (ethanol, diacetyl and acetoin) more readily. However, the HS-SPME was found to be the more sensitive and effective method of the two techniques tested. The next step in the thesis was to investigate the presence of the six analytes in milk and cultured yoghurt. The effects of the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation on the volatile concentrations were also examined. The results suggested that the six analytes were inherently present in milks but at low concentrations. No conclusive effects were found for the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation. However, it was evident that fermentation of the milks using bacterial starter cultures resulted in a large increase in some of the volatiles being investigated. Following this, the effects of fat levels, storage time and storage temperature on the six volatiles in yoghurts were examined. The results indicated that significant fat level effects were only seen for diacetyl and acetoin, while temperature effects were only observed for ethanol. In both trials, only general trends for the analytes concentrations were drawn because the data varied from day to day. The results suggested that most of the compounds decreased with time except for diacetyl, which seemed to increase. The final part of this study looked at applying the devised HS-SPME methodology to a series of commercial yoghurts as a preliminary trial, with a view to investigating a potential application for the HS-SPME method. Fourteen commercial yoghurts were analysed and the six analytes quantified. The data obtained was analysed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which divided the yoghurts into groups based on their analyte concentrations. From these groupings, eight yoghurts were selected and fresh samples were analysed using HS-SPME and PCA. This was carried out parallel with an untrained consumer panel, which had to distinguish differences between the yoghurts in a series of triangle tests by smelling the headspace on opening the yoghurt containers. The conclusions drawn were that, unlike the HS-SPME method with PCA, the average consumer could not differentiate the yoghurts based on smell alone. PCA also showed that the HS-SPME results obtained were fairly reproducible. In conclusion, the HS-SPME method was shown to be a useful analytical technique, which can be used to analyse and quantify flavour compounds in natural, <b>set</b> <b>yoghurts.</b> This area of investigation has a lot of scope, with the results from this study providing a basis or starting point for further investigations in this area.

Various levels of jack fruit chunks (3 - 5 mm) viz. 3, 5, and 7 percentages (w/v) were used in the preparation of fruit yoghurt. On the basis of various sensory attributes, yoghurt containing 5 % jack fruit chunks was selected as optimum.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} liquid whey protein {{concentrates}} (LWPC) on biochemical, physical and sensorial properties of <b>set</b> <b>yoghurt</b> were studied. Bovine and ovine LWPC {{were used to}} partially replace skimmed milk powder (SMP) in bovine yoghurt formulations. The properties of modified yoghurts were evaluated during their shelf-life and compared with conventional bovine and ovine yoghurts. The protein content of ovine yoghurt differs significantly (p< 0. 05) from the bovine ones (with or without LWPC supplementation). Higher values of hardness, adhesiveness and gumminess were observed for conventional yoghurts, although cohesiveness, resilience and springiness did not vary between formulations. During the products shelf-life a decrease in luminosity was observed, but {{no significant differences in}} colour occurred among formulations. Low syneresis indexes, ranging from 0. 5 to 5. 0 %, which are typical in the range of yoghurts with high levels of solids, were achieved for the produced yoghurts. The decrease in viscosity led to an increase in syneresis, indicating that the gel structure was more open retaining water not so efficiently. Ovine yoghurts showed lower syneresis and higher viscosity values, while the yoghurts enriched with LWPC showed the opposite pattern. At the sensory level no differences (p< 0. 001) were found between conventional bovine yoghurt and yoghurts with LWPC. However, in the case of ovine yoghurt (LO) significative differences were identified, and this product was strongly penalized in the preference test. The results revealed that LWPC (independently of the source) can be used in <b>set</b> <b>yoghurt</b> formulations, increasing protein and total solids content, for total or partial replacement of the conventional adjuvant (SMP).

40|$|WOS: 000324008600021; [URL] audienceThe term "freshness sensation" {{is used by}} {{consumers}} for characterizing some plain yoghurts and yoghurt-like products. This study consisted in an investigation of this sensation aiming at determining its underlying sensory attributes. First, two focus groups of consumers were conducted {{to open up the}} framework. A <b>set</b> of plain <b>yoghurts</b> and yoghurt-like products, both commercial and experimental, was then subjected to sensory analysis. The samples were sorted by means of a free sorting task, and further scored for the intensity of their freshness sensation and their liking, by 72 untrained consumers. Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) measurements were performed by a trained sensory panel on the same products. The holistic notations of the freshness sensation and TDS results were finally combined using an internal mapping methodology. Freshness sensation and liking were highly correlated. However, a product with a low liking score was evaluated as giving an intense freshness sensation. A strong consensus of untrained subjects was observed on the fermented milk with the lowest freshness sensation intensity. Fermented milks with the highest freshness sensation intensity were the ones with the highest fat content. The main characteristics of the freshness sensation in yoghurts and yoghurt-like products were a sensation of decrease in the mouth temperature, followed by a fluid texture together with a cream flavor. A thick texture followed by the sensations of acidity and astringency clearly appeared to decrease the freshness sensation of the products. The key sensory attributes of the freshness sensation were highlighted by classical sensory approaches (free sorting task, freshness sensation scoring and focus groups). Their temporal order was determined by the TDS methodology. This could be valuable for formulating fresher products...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of processes for {{the preparation of}} prebiotic compounds, namely inulin from tubers of Jerusalem artichoke (JA-Helianthus tuberosus L.), and lactulose from milk concentration permeate (MCP) was examined. Inulin was extracted from the whole JA tubers using hydrothermal extraction process, followed by clarification and concentration. The concentrate was fractionated using two different procedures i. e. ethanol fractionation and cold precipitation (+ 4 and/or - 24 C) into high- and low-molecular-weight components. The most satisfactory method was cold fractionation wherein the insoluble heavier inulin fractions were found to settle {{to the bottom and}} were separated and spray-dried to obtain inulin powder. Lactose in MCP was isomerised into lactulose using carbonate-based catalysts (oyster shell and egg shell powders) followed by clarification and concentration. Th e high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-RID) chromatograms and changes in pH and colour values confirmed the conversion of lactose into lactulose and decomposition of lactulose into by-products. The results obtained showed the suitability of oyster shell powder for lactose isomerisation in lieu of egg shell powder. For preparing lactulose-enriched MCP with acceptable lactulose yield of 22 %, the optimum reaction conditions were found to be catalyst loading of 12 mg per mL of MCP and isomerisation time of 120 min at 96 C. The resulting products i. e. JAI concentrate and powder and lactulose-enriched MCP syrup (40 ºB) were tested for their prebiotic power in media broth and in fermented milk models. Prebiotic properties of these compounds were observed as supplementation levels increased from 0 - 2 % to 3 - 4 %. Based on the growth and acidification abilities of the probiotic strains tested, the combination of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01 with JAI, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 with lactulose-enriched MCP syrup were found to be the best for {{development of}} synbiotic yoghurt. The prebiotic effect of JAIP was then compared with the two commercial chicory inulin products (Raftiline GR and Raftilose P 95). Probiotic yoghurts supplemented with 4 % inulin powders were prepared from reconstituted skim milk using mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (1 : 0. 5 : 0. 5, w/w). The survival and acidifying activity of probiotic and lactic acid cultures were investigated during the shelf life of 28 days at 4 ºC. Incorporation of JAIP and chicory inulins resulted in a significant improvement in viability of LC- 01 compared with non-supplemented yoghurt, maintaining more than 107 CFU g- 1 throughout storage time. Additionally, the suitability of JAIP as fat replacer was determined in a <b>set</b> of fat-free <b>yoghurt</b> in comparison to three commercial chicory inulin products. Results of large deformation tests revealed that the firmness of JAIP-supplemented yoghurt was reduced to a similar level as the full-fat control yoghurt. However, small deformation results showed that the JAIP could not fully mimic milk fat to the same extent as Raftiline HP with an average DP of 23. The rheological effects of JAIP addition were comparable to those of short-chain (Raftilose P 95 with an average DP of 4) and medium-chain inulins (Raftiline® GR with an average DP of 12) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of various stabilizers on whey seperation (syneresis) {{and the quality of}} <b>set</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> Yoghurt was prepared by using seven various stabilizers like pectin, guargum, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), carrageenan, sodium alginate, cornstarch and gelatin @ 0. 4 % in milk containing 3. 5 % milk fat and total solids 16. 6 %. Various determinations such as pH, acidity, lactose and syneresis level were made at 0, 5, 10 and 15 days of storage interval. It was observed that there was gradual decrease in pH and increase in acidity in all samples during 15 days at 10 °C± 1. Lactose contents decrease in all Yoghurt samples during storage due to its conversion into lactic acid. It was observed that cornstarch tend to reduce syneresis followed by gelatin, pectin, guargum, CMC, Carrageenan, sodium alginate while comparing with control...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{components}} of yoghurt milk samples and resulting probiotic <b>set</b> <b>yoghurt</b> were determined. Analyses included total nitrogen (TN), non-casein nitrogen (NCN), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), casein nitrogen (CN) and proteolysis index (PI). Yoghurt samples were analyzed 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after production and storage at 5 ± 1 °C. TN, CN and PI contents of yoghurt milk samples with high Somatic Cell SC level {{were lower than}} yoghurt milk with low SC (p< 0. 05). NCN and NPN concentrations of yoghurt milk increased by the elevation of SC level, however differences between low and medium milk samples were not significant. During storage life, TN and CN contents of all yoghurt samples decreased significantly. NCN and NPN concentrations of probiotic yoghurt samples increased (p< 0. 05) after 21 days. It was concluded that SC level elevation in milk decreased casein {{as a percentage of}} true protein in the resulting probiotic yoghurt throughout storage for 21 days...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Set</b> <b>yoghurt</b> from goat’s {{milk with}} {{adjusted}} pH to 6, 4, 6, 3, 6, 2 and 6, 1 and than modified by microbial transglutaminase (TGase) were produced. Control yoghurt was produced from goat’s milk of pH 6, 4 but without modification by TGase. In yoghurt determined sensory quality, pH, texture parameters and syneresis. Modification of goat’s milk by TGase caused {{an increase in}} apparent viscosity, hardness and adhesiveness of the yoghurt. The pH of the milk incubated with TGase in the range 6. 4 - 6. 1 has no influence on such texture parameters like viscosity, hardness, adhesiveness, extrusion force and syneresis.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a dairy industry problem on integrated planning and scheduling of <b>set</b> <b>yoghurt</b> production. A mixed integer linear programming formulation is introduced to integrate tactical and operational decisions and a heuristic approach is proposed to decompose time buckets of the decisions. The decomposition heuristic improves computational efficiency by solving big bucket planning and small bucket scheduling problems. Further, mixed integer linear programming and constraint programming methodologies are {{combined with the}} algorithm to show their complementary strengths. Numerical studies using illustrative data with high demand granularity (i. e., {{a large number of}} small-sized customer orders) demonstrate that the proposed decomposition heuristic has consistent results minimizing the total cost (i. e., on average 8. 75 % gap with the best lower bound value found by MILP) and, the developed hybrid approach is capable of solving real sized instances within a reasonable amount of time (i. e., on average 92 % faster than MILP in CPU time) ...|$|E
