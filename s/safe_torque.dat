50|$|The <b>Safe</b> <b>Torque</b> Off (STO) is an {{electronic}} signal used in industrial motor drives for safety reasons.|$|E
30|$|The {{same process}} was {{followed}} for ten bolt constructs secured using 9.5  Nm torque which, in part 3, {{was found to}} be a <b>safe</b> amount of <b>torque</b> prior to breakage at the driver–head interface.|$|R
40|$|The Series Elasic Actuator {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a method for providing <b>safe</b> force or <b>torque</b> based acutation for robots that interact with humans. In this paper we look at some outstanding issues in the implementaion and control of Series Elastic Actuators. The study addresses issues in making the Series Elastic Actuator respond effectively {{in the presence of}} physical difficulties such as stiction, using a computation efficient controller. The improvement over previous implementations is achieved by treating the motor as a velocity source to the elastic element, rather than as a torque source. ...|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} examine, when a {{controlled}} torque {{was applied for}} securing all half pins, the loosening points of these constructs when subjected to axial loading. From the investigation in part 3, it was established that 5  Nm was a <b>safe</b> amount of <b>torque</b> to be applied on grub screws prior to breakage at the driver–head interface. Ten constructs using grub screws and ten using bolts were secured applying 5  Nm with a calibrated torque wrench. The constructs were then placed on a universal testing machine—UTM (Fig.  1 d), and increasing axial loads were applied to determine points of loosening as determined as mechanical failure on the load deformation curve.|$|R
40|$|The Velocity Sourced Series Elasic Actuator {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a method for providing <b>safe</b> force or <b>torque</b> based acutation for robots without compromsing the actuator performance. In this paper we assess the safety of Velocity Sourced Series Elastic Actuators by measuring the Head Injury Criterion scores for collisions with a model head. The study makes a comparitive analysis against stiff, high impedance actuation using the same motor without the series elastic component, showing that the series elastic component brings about a massive reduction in the chance of head injury. The benefits of a collision detection and safe reaction system are shown {{to be limited to}} collisions at low speeds, providing greater interaction comfort but not necessarily contributing to safety from injury. ...|$|R
