This technology represents a basic method for achieving super fine granularity structures. Especially non-ferrous metals and their alloys are of primary concern. Non-ferrous metals, and their alloys are subject of an easy recycling process, and they increasingly tend to <b>substitute</b> <b>steel</b> on a larger scale.

40|$|Abstract. A lot of {{innovations}} in molding and casting technology and also simulation techniques have made ductile iron {{more and more}} competitive and it even competes meanwhile against steel forgings. A successful substitution of steel forgings for example is the wheel carrier for a high vo-lume car with the Georg Fischer new ductile iron material 'SiboDur', a ductile iron family with high strength and high elongation at the same time. But {{there is still a}} great potential for ductile iron cast-ings to <b>substitute</b> <b>steel</b> forgings, in particular in the automotive industry. One example is the crank-shaft for the engine: Quite a lot of gasoline engines are equipped with ductile iron crankshafts, but for instance most of the diesel engines are still running with forged steel cranks. The reason is most-ly the belief of design engineers that {{it is not possible to}} get similar fatigue limit with castings com-pared to forged steel. This belief may often be correct, but using local strengthening technologies, such as roller burnishing of bearing fillets or inductive hardening of highly stressed areas can raise the fatigue limit of casted crankshafts dramatically. The paper presents studies which show that using the right ductile iron material and optimized roller burnishing conditions can raise the fatigue limit of cast crankshafts to values even higher than forged steel ones (material 38 MnVS 6). But even quenched and tempered forged steel crankshafts are in the focus to be substituted by castings. It i...|$|E
40|$|Ship {{recycling}} {{is an issue}} currently causing {{a lot of concern}} and debates in the globalized world. Around 70 % of all end-of-life ships and more than 90 % of the EU fleet, are recycled on the beaches of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, causing serious environmental and health hazards. At the same time, ship {{recycling is}} a source of valuable recyclable materials, mainly steel scrap used for steel making. India is the 4 th largest steel producing country in the world, having a high demand for steel scrap {{and at the same time}} accounts for the largest share of the ship recycling activity worldwide. The objective of the study is to provide insight to the relationship between ship recycling and the steel industry in India, with a focus on European ships. Although this relationship is very crucial for the ship recycling issue as a whole, it is one of the least researched angels. A hypothetical scenario is developed assuming that all EU ships recycled in India during 2012 were actually not recycled in India and consequently, the corresponding steel scrap was not available for steel production. The issues that are investigated include the alternative materials that could substitute ships’ scrap for steel making, as well as the related CO 2 emissions and overall environmental impacts for the production of the substitute materials. The analysis reveals that in order to <b>substitute</b> <b>steel</b> scrap from ship recycling in India, production of direct reduced iron (DRI) as well as steel from induction furnaces (IFs) would have to increase. Furthermore, the production of these materials would result in additional CO 2 emissions as well as extensive soil and air pollution, especially for the case of DRI, due to significant waste generation combined with improper handling and disposal. Therefore, the main conclusion is that ship recycling has a particular importance for the case of India because of the special nature of the Indian steel industry, relying mostly on energy intensive and polluting processes for iron and steel production. In that way, ship recycling can have positive environmental impacts by contributing to CO 2 savings related to steel production. However, the results represent only one side of the issue and for that reason they are presented in the form of trade-offs. Ship recycling can contribute in a positive way to steel production in India, if at the same time the negative impacts of the ship recycling activity are dealt with in a proper way...|$|E

40|$|One {{method to}} improve the fuel {{efficiency}} of American made vehicles is to reduce vehicle weight by <b>substituting</b> <b>steel</b> components with lighter magnesium (Mg) components. Unfortunately, U. S. produced Mg currently costs approximately $ 3. 31 per kg, over seven times the price of steel. Furthermore, Mg production has a staggering energy and environmental impact, consuming up to 102 kW-hr/kg-Mg of energy and producing 36 kg of CO 2 /kg-Mg. To reduce the overwhelming economic and environmental impact of Mg, a new solar thermal electrolytic process has been developed {{for the production of}} Mg from MgO. Through this process, liquid Mg is produced in a solar reactor utilizing both thermal and electrical energy. At elevated temperatures, the thermal energy from concentrated sunlight reduces the required electrical work below that of current processes. The reactor absorbs the concentrated solar energy, heating a molten salt-MgO mixture in an electrolytic cell. Electricity is then supplied to the cell, producing liquid Mg and CO. It is estimated that this new process will produce Mg at $ 2. 50 per kg, with costs decreasing as the technology is further developed. This process requires approximately 8. 3 kW-hr/kg-Mg of energy and produces only 3. 44 kg of CO 2 /kg-Mg, large reductions compared to current processes...|$|R

40|$|Buildings {{in general}} and {{residential}} buildings in particular {{impact on the environment}} through the energy and carbon embodied in the production and use of building materials. A number of studies have identified portland cement, portland cement cement-based products and steel reinforcement as major contributors to the embodied impact of residential buildings. Incidentally, these high impact materials constitute the bulk of the materials used in urban residential building construction in Nigeria. Also, there is considerable literature on alternative building materials which can be used to substitute high impact materials in Nigeria. Using the literature review approach, this paper examines the alternative materials {{that can be used to}} substitute the prevalent high impact materials with a view to making the buildings more sustainable by reducing their embodied energy.

30|$|Assuming that {{harvested}} biomass would {{substitute for}} fossil-intensive products increased {{the value of}} the carbon mitigation metric in stands WS 4 and WS 5. This increase was small in the case of ethanol: only 0.38 units of fossil carbon are avoided for every 1 unit of carbon in ethanol substituting for petroleum fuels (Lippke et al. 2012). In this case, the carbon benefits of product substitution were insufficient to compensate for the loss of carbon during harvest and WS 4 and WS 5 still incurred a “carbon debt”. The magnitude of this debt was less than in the case where no substitution was assumed, however. Comparatively, the use of LLWP in place of fossil-intensive <b>substitutes</b> (<b>steel,</b> concrete, etc.) results in much larger quantities of avoided carbon: 2.1 units for every 1 unit in the biomass itself (Lippke et al. 2012). Because the carbon displacement ratio in this case is greater than 1 : 1 (i.e. the loss of carbon due to harvesting biomass is less than the benefits gained by producing and using LLWP), the carbon mitigation metric actually increased after harvest. In WS 5, the scaled value for this metric increased from 0.31 to 0.96 in the harvest year. In WS 4, where less than half as much biomass was removed, the value increased from 0.21 in the year before harvest to 0.43 after the third harvest was completed. In both stands, aboveground carbon continued to increase after harvest as biomass regenerated and stand carbon recovered.|$|R

Composite tubes have a superior strength to weight ratio compared to steel tubes. The oil industry is facing new challenges {{and the demand for}} more robust materials is increasing. Prior to <b>substituting</b> <b>steel</b> material with composites in tubes, it is important to gain knowledge about {{the behavior of}} composite tubes and develop reliable analytical methods. An experimental and analytical study of small diameter carbon fiber tubes was carried out in this thesis. The tubes were made using filament winding with a layup of [&# 177; 75] and a wall thickness of 1. 5 mm. The tubes were tested under external pressure with optical fibers attached to measure the strain during the tests. A linear buckling analysis and Riks analysis was done using the Abaqus solver to predict buckling and compare strain results to the experimental tests. The transverse and longitudinal Young&# 146;s modulus were experimentally found and implemented into the finite element analysis. The predicted buckling value deviated significantly from the experimental tests. In the experimental tests, the tubes buckled at 52. 5 % lower pressure than what was expected from the finite element analysis. The strain readings from the optical fibers gave higher values than the strains from the finite element analysis at equal pressures. However, strain at equal pressure might not be comparable because the tube from the analysis could withstand higher pressure before it started showing tendencies of buckling. In conclusion, the analytical model in this thesis has its weaknesses and can be further improved to capture the imperfections of the tube more accurately. </p...|$|R
