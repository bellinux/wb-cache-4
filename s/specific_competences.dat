40|$|Generalization {{of skills}} {{is a major}} problem in social skills {{training}} for schizophrenic patients. Assessment of skills is mostly not based on objective indices of specific skill deficits. The results of this study show that global competence of schizophrenics can be differentiated from <b>specific</b> <b>competence.</b> Global competence was found to be related to symptoms, whereas <b>specific</b> <b>competence</b> was not. No support was found for the assumption that social dysfunctions are caused by negative symptoms. Social perception and positive symptoms did explain a substantial part of the variance of global competence. It is therefore concluded that neither global incompetence nor negative symptoms should be used as an indication for social skills training...|$|R

50|$|But the key duality of {{identity}} that {{lies at the}} core of the teacher educator profession is that of first-order and second order teaching. A teacher educator must be a highly competent ‘first-order educator’ (i.e. a good teacher) but also a skilled ‘second-order educator’ (i.e. capable of teaching effectively about the skill of teaching and facilitating others to acquire teaching skills). As first-order educators, they need to be proficient teachers (of 'adult' students). As second-order educators, they require, in addition, <b>specific</b> <b>competences</b> and dispositions, such as modelling and meta-reflection, that enable them to teach about teaching.|$|E
50|$|The {{implication}} {{of all this}} is that teacher educators must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggest that teaching how to reflect requires teacher educators to possess and deploy <b>specific</b> <b>competences.</b> However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced teacher educators, noted that the teacher educators they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect.|$|E

Similarly, in a trade organization, the rules of trade only should be applied, and their leaders should be drawn from their own ranks of expertise. Similarly agriculture does not derive its laws from the government but from the laws of nature. Whenever a government presumes to regulate outside its sovereignty, those serving within the affected sphere should protest that the State is interfering in their internal affairs. The question is how far the state can act without interfering.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} {{was established in the}} first additional provision of the constitution, after much debate in the Cortes Generales acting as a Constituent Assembly. This provision established a protection and respect for the historical rights of the territories that had fueros, [...] "charters", [...] "privileges" [...] or [...] "jurisdictions", which were to be [...] "updated" [...] {{within the framework of the}} constitution. These territories were Álava, Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Navarre. The first three joined to form the autonomous community of the Basque Country, whereas Navarre was constituted itself as the Chartered Community of Navarre. The charters that were recognized and updated grant them <b>specific</b> <b>competences</b> not recognized in other autonomous communities, most notably, fiscal autonomy. As such, these two autonomous communities are known as communities of chartered regime (comunidades de régimen foral) as opposed to the rest of the autonomous communities without fiscal autonomy, which are known as communities of common regime.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} practices use {{the term}} [...] "placement" [...] as a denominator for their activities, and some form of definition is necessary to distinguish between these, and to mark it off from ordinary employment abroad {{as well as other}} forms of transnational mobility. Placements may be set up by an organiser who has made the necessary arrangements for a placement, defined the intended learning outcome, and thought out the pedagogic implications. Placements may also be self-organised by the participant. When a student organises a work stay in another country during holidays or a study break, this may or may not qualify as a placement according to the criterion of intent. If the purpose is to acquire vocational skills and/or improve language and intercultural skills in general, it should be seen as a placement, and count it as such, rather than a holiday job. It may be inscribed in an educational context through accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL), if the organisation can be convinced that the person in question has sought out learning situations during the stay rather than just focused on having a good time or earning as much money as possible. Other activities in this borderline category are au pair placements and voluntary work in charitable institutions and organisations, e.g. as financed under the European Voluntary Service.The practice of some companies to send employees abroad in foreign subsidiaries {{for a period of time}} in order to acquire <b>specific</b> <b>competences</b> may also be considered under this label. It should be distinguished from employment abroad in general, which is another matter. The line is blurred, and different definitions may collide here. Any labour market activity where the participant draws some kind of wages or salary is juridically considered as employment. But payment is not necessarily a way of distinguishing between placements and proper jobs; placements may be paid or unpaid, even though the learning role of participants is often signified by the fact that they receive no - or a considerably reduced - payment.|$|E

40|$|This study {{encourages}} {{decision making}} {{in the field of}} university training of Physical Education and Sports teachers. It consists in observing and analysing the evolution of pre and post active planning of intern students and identifying their didactic competence during the internship period. Following a qualitative approach a corpus of seventy-two documents prepared by six intern students at the Higher Institute of Sports and Physical Education (ISSEP) in Kef was analyzed. The analysis of these document is based on “guiding questions” constructed from the normative didactic. The analysis of the data allowed inferences about the didactic competence observed. Case analysis and multi-case analysis revealed a static trend in the evolution of <b>specific</b> <b>competence</b> in planning. The appearance of recurrent difficulties in some <b>specific</b> <b>competence</b> reveals the thesis of a “survival strategy” developed by intern students. The in-depth analysis of the preparations also revealed an ineluctable effect of “pedagogy by objectives” on the logic and nature of planning and balance sheets of lessons developed.
