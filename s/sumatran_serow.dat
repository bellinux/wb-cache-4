25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow</b> in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
50|$|Animal species include Asian black bear, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow,</b> banteng, pangolin, monitor lizard and leopard.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow</b> (Capricornis sumatraensis), {{also known}} as the {{southern}} serow, is a species of goat-antelope native to mountain forests in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The former name of this species is [...] "mainland serow", as all the mainland species of serow (Chinese, red and Himalayan) were previously considered subspecies of this species. The <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow</b> is threatened due to habitat loss and hunting, leading to it being evaluated as vulnerable by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} area {{is covered}} by various forest types, depending on altitude, including dry evergreen forests, hill evergreen forests, coniferous forests, deciduous dipterocarp forests, and meadows. It is the home {{to a number of}} endangered species of animals, such as long-tailed gorals (Naemorhedus caudatus), <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serows</b> (Capricornis sumatraensis), Asian golden cats (Catopuma temminckii), and big-headed turtles (Platysternon megacephalum). Deignan's babblers (Stachyridopsis rodolphei) and Huia melasma are endemic to this area.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{distinctive}} plant is the [...] "golden leaves" [...] or [...] "yandao". This plant was first discovered in 1988 here. The vine leaves are gold in colour, {{similar to a}} hardwood tree of the genus Bauhinia, but considerably larger. Some leaves are even larger than the palm of a hand. The edges of the leaves are curved throughout, like two connected ovals. The leaves have a soft velvet-like texture. Rare animals {{in the area are}} rhinoceros, agile gibbons, tapirs, and <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serows.</b> The most important animal is the spectacled langur that inhabits Southeast Asia in the south of Myanmar and Thailand all the way to Malaysia and some islands. It lives on high mountains and in deep jungles in groups of around 30-40. The strongest male is the leader. The langur is usually shy, afraid of humans and not aggressive like monkeys. Apart from the spectacled langur, there are three other types in Thailand; banded langurs, gray langurs, and northern spectacled langurs. All four species of langurs are endangered mammals.|$|R

50|$|Although home to {{a smaller}} variety of {{wildlife}} than the surrounding rainforest these pine forests are relatively unspoilt and therefore still important habitat {{for a number of}} species adapted to the rocky heights. When the area was surveyed by the Wildlife Conservation Society in the 1950s mammals of the pine forest included <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow</b> (Capricornis sumatrensis), sambar (rusa unicolor), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Asian black bear (ursus thibetanus) while smaller mammals include Oriental giant squirrels, Indian giant flying squirrel and civets. None of these mammals are endemic to this ecoregion.|$|E

The primates identified are the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey and Phayre's leaf monkey; the last named is reported to be extinct. The habitat of the mammals, including primates, is stated to be shrinking due to deforestation and expansion of agricultural activities.|$|E
50|$|The moist {{climate and}} {{undisturbed}} {{nature of the}} rocky mountainsides appears to have allowed a rich variety of wildlife to thrive, although the Cardamom and Elephant Mountains are poorly researched and the wildlife that {{is assumed to be}} here remains to be catalogued. They are thought to be home to over 100 mammals such as the large Indian civet and banteng cattle, and most importantly the mountains are thought to shelter at least 62 globally threatened animal species and 17 globally threatened trees, many of them endemic to Cambodia. Among the animals are fourteen endangered and threatened mammal species, including the largest population of Asian elephant in Cambodia and possibly the whole of Indochina although this still needs to be proved. Other mammals, many of which are threatened, include Indochinese tiger, clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), dhole (a wild dog) (Cuon alpinus), gaur (Bos gaurus), banteng (Bos javanicus), the disputed kting voar (Pseudonovibos spiralis), Malayan sun bear, pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus), <b>Sumatran</b> <b>serow</b> (Capricornis sumatraensis), Sunda pangolin and the Tenasserim white-bellied rat.
