5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> or may not have slightly negative values.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy (stylized as Goodbye, Galaxy!) is {{a two-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by id Software {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1991 for MS-DOS. It consists of the fifth and sixth episodes of the Commander Keen series, though they are numbered as the fourth and fifth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he first journeys through the Shadowlands to rescue the Gnosticenes <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> ask the Oracle how the Shikadi plan to destroy the galaxy, and then through the Shikadi's Armageddon Machine to stop them. The two episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E

5|$|The fate of L'Oiseau Blanc is {{occasionally}} {{mentioned in}} films. The 1999 made-for-TV Canadian film Restless Spirits, a children's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators, uses {{the mystery of}} Nungesser and Coli's disappearance as the key plot device. A young girl, who struggles with her pilot father's death in an aircraft crash years before, visits her grandmother in Newfoundland. While there, she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser and Coli, whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond. The girl decides to help the pair {{move on to the}} afterlife by assisting them in rebuilding their aircraft and completing their flight <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be released and, by doing so, works through her own emotional distress over her father's test flight death. And in the opening montage of the 2005 film Sahara, based on Cussler's novel, a French newspaper article is displayed reporting a fictional story of NUMA finding the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
