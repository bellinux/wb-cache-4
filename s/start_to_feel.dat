5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
500|$|Cats are {{familiar}} and easily kept animals, and their physiology {{has been particularly}} well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species. For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about , but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around , and can tolerate temperatures of up to [...] if {{they have access to}} water.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said the}} episode {{included}} some good laughs but [...] "never kicks into high gear" [...] {{and said the}} themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode: [...] "'Fishsticks' {{is one of those}} episodes that typically occur around now in the South Park season. It's not great, not bad – hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable." [...] Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said he was disappointed by the episode and thought the message about celebrity self-delusion might have been better if it focused on only West or Mencia, rather than both. Although O'Neal liked the West song in the episode's final scene, O'Neal said [...] "cramming (West and Mencia) together — even mixed in with Cartman's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me, and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a little too one-note." ...|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. It received {{a score of}} 91.96% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the [...] "fantastic soundtrack" [...] and [...] "great peripheral", further commenting that mini-Gibson SG controller [...] "is what makes Guitar Hero, rather than what breaks it". GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists {{a chance to live}} out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that [...] "once you hit the three minute mark or so, things <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> 'too long'". Eurogamer said, [...] "the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer's perspective" [...] and [...] "it would have been truly amazing with a better track list".|$|E
500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilles Grimandi, Dixon and Overmars {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's victory at Leicester City in early December. Matthew Upson {{was forced to}} come off the pitch before the half-hour mark, after {{suffering}} a knee injury. Arsenal only managed a draw against Wimbledon on 18 December 1999; Henry's second half goal cancelled out Wimbledon's opener – a cross by Marcus Gayle met Carl Cort, whose shot hit goalkeeper Alex Manninger's left leg and went in. The poor form over Christmas continued: Arsenal lost 3–2 to Coventry City on Boxing Day. Rob Hughes of The Times noted his concerns about Arsenal's defence, which: [...] "...conceded 17 goals last season but now, at the halfway stage, [...] have already let in 20", but did go on to add [...] "there was nothing lacking in the tenacity of Arsenal." [...] Vieira made his return for the match against league leaders Leeds United, who were eight points in front of Arsenal. Wenger reshuffled the defence, dropping Dixon and Winterburn for Luzhny and Sylvinho, while Grimandi replaced Keown who was injured. Ljungberg and Henry scored for Arsenal in their 2–0 win to put the team third at the end of 1999. Adams suggested after the Leeds match that his opponents' inexperience and thin squad would jeopardise their chances of winning the league: [...] "They are still involved in the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup as well. So come February time they will <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that pressure – and you don't know what it is like until you have been through it." ...|$|E

[...] He claims that he is [...] "all for the Burmese and all against the British" [...] {{and goes on to}} say that [...] "feelings like these are the normal by-products of imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off duty." [...] This creates a sense of empathy from the imperialists for the natives, but as they treat their conquerors badly, they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> less guilty and so treat them badly once more.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Da Capo II {{release was}} positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: [...] "I {{know a lot}} of gamers may not enjoy Da Capo, but whilst I think the story on some arcs was weaker than on others they were still amazing paths to play. On the stronger paths you really <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a lot of emotion for these girls, and because they're so closely tied together, someone always gets hurt. That for me bought some realism to the game." [...] In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the fifty best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Da Capo II ranked seventh with forty-seven votes. Da Capo II was the most widely sold game of 2006 on Getchu.com.

Before I could think of an effective reply Nancy was being carried off by the young man from the East, who was clearly infatuated. He was not provincial.
