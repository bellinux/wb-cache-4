5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict <b>selection</b> <b>scheme</b> to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and evaluated for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{emphasize}} {{the role of}} selection in evolutionary algorithms. We briefly review {{some of the most}} common <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> from the fields of Genetic Algorithms, Evolution Strategies and Genetic Programming.

40|$|Abstract. Kernel density {{estimation}} (KDE) is {{an important}} method in nonparametric learning. While KDE has been studied extensively {{in the context of}} accuracy of density estimation, it has not been studied exten-sively in the context of classification. This paper studies nine bandwidth <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> for kernel density estimation in Naive Bayesian clas-sification context, using 52 machine learning benchmark datasets. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, it shows that some com-monly used and very sophisticated bandwidth <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> do not give good performance in Naive Bayes. Surprisingly, some very simple bandwidth <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> give statistically significantly better per-formance. Second, it shows that kernel density estimation can achieve statistically significantly better classification performance than a com-monly used discretization method in Naive Bayes, but only when appro-priate bandwidth <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> are applied. Third, this study gives bandwidth distribution patterns for the investigated bandwidth <b>selection</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|After the Tiananmen Square {{massacre}} in 1989, {{many people in}} Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs – but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the British Nationality <b>Selection</b> <b>Scheme,</b> which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act, 1990. Under the act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically {{ceased to be a}} BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.|$|E
40|$|We study version <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> {{for hard}} realtime {{communications}} in multi-access networks. In many hard real-time systems a message may have several versions, e. g., a long version {{and a short}} version. The long version of a message contains complete information and is the preferred version to be transmitted. The short version contains less information and requires less time to be transmitted. Version <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> are responsible for determining which version of a message to transmit, and must make a tradeoff between information completeness and message loss. Two classes of version <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> are proposed in this paper: those {{that are based on}} message time constraints, and those that are based on the network traffic.

25|$|Chinese {{nationality}} law {{has applied}} in Hong Kong since the handover on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong BDTC status {{ceased to exist}} and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong {{was presented at the}} Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes settled in a foreign country and acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality <b>Selection</b> <b>Scheme</b> are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became settled in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a dual national), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.|$|E

40|$|Action {{selection}} is typically a "built-in" feature of agent architectures and hence {{not subject to}} change in instantiated architectures. While often (especially in simple agents) this lack of flexibility does not matter, there are circumstances where dynamic adjustments of an action selection strategy are desirable. In this paper, we present an architecture framework, called APOC, that provides architectural mechanisms for dynamic adjustments of action <b>selection</b> <b>schemes.</b> We show how common action <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> (such as "winner-takes-it-all" or hierarchical schemes as used in subsumption architectures) can be implemented in APOC and, furthermore, {{how they can be}} modified dynamically.

30|$|In addition, {{compared}} to the independent <b>selection</b> <b>schemes,</b> when the dis-joint selection is applied, all the studied techniques suffer from a loss of outage performance since the set of possible selected paths is reduced due to the dis-joint selection constraint. However, this loss is compensated by a reduction of the computation complexity. Hence, a compromise between computation complexity and outage performance is achieved between independent and dis-joint <b>selection</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{handwritten}} pattern recognition, {{the multiple}} classifier {{system has been}} shown to be useful for improving recognition rates. One of the most important tasks in optimizing a multiple classifier system is to select a group of adequate classifiers, known as an Ensemble of Classifiers (EoC), from a pool of classifiers. Static <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> select an EoC for all test patterns, and dynamic <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> select different classifiers for different test patterns. Nevertheless, it has been shown that traditional dynamic selection performs no better than static selection. We propose four new dynamic <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> which explore the properties of the oracle concept.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} noise on different selection mechanisms for genetic algorithms. Models for several <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> are developed that successfully predict the convergence characteristics of genetic algorithms within noisy environments. The <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> modeled in this paper include proportionate selection, tournament selection, (¯,) selection, and linear ranking selection. An allele-wise model for convergence {{in the presence of}} noise is developed for the OneMax domain, and then extended to more complex domains where the building blocks are uniformly scaled.

40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} {{has long}} been considered a likely explanation for {{the high levels of}} genetic variation found in most natural populations: selection in a spatially heterogeneous environment can maintain more variation. While this theoretical result has been extensively studied in models with limited parameters (e. g., two alleles, fixed gene flow, and particular <b>selection</b> <b>schemes),</b> the effect of spatial heterogeneity is poorly understood for models with a wider range of parameters (e. g., multiple alleles, different levels of gene flow, and more general <b>selection</b> <b>schemes).</b> We have compared the volume of fitness space that maintains variation in a single-deme model to the volume in a two-deme model for multiple alleles, random <b>selection</b> <b>schemes,</b> and various levels of migration. Furthermore, equilibrium allele-frequency vectors were examined to see if particular patterns of variation are more prevalent than first expected. The two-deme model maintains variation for substantially larger volumes of fitness space with lower heterozygote fitness than the single-deme model. This result implies that <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> in the two-deme model can have a wider range of fitness patterns while still maintaining variation. The equilibrium allele-frequency patterns emerging from the two-deme model are more variable and strongly influenced by gene flow...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} outage {{performance}} of different multicarrier relay <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> for two-hop orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in a Poisson field of relays. In particular, special {{emphasis is placed}} on decode-andforward (DF) relay systems, equipped with bulk and per-subcarrier <b>selection</b> <b>schemes,</b> respectively. The exact expressions for outage probability are derived in integrals for general cases. In addition, asymptotic expressions for outage probability in the high signalto-noise ratio (SNR) region in the finite circle relay distribution region are determined in closed forms for both relay <b>selection</b> <b>schemes.</b> Also, the outage probabilities for free space in the infinite relay distribution region are derived in closed forms. Meanwhile, a series of important properties related to cooperative systems in random networks are investigated, including diversity, outage probability ratio of two <b>selection</b> <b>schemes</b> and optimization of the number of subcarriers in terms of system throughput. All analyses are numerically verified by simulations. Finally, a framework for analyzing the outage performance of OFDM systems with spatially random relays is constructed, which can be easily modified to analyze other similar cases with different forwarding protocols, location distributions and/or channel conditions...|$|R
