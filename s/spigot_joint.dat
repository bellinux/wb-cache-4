50|$|Cast iron {{proved to}} be a {{beneficial}} material for the manufacture of water pipes and was used as a replacement for the original elm pipelines laid in the ground earlier. These water pipelines were composed of individually cast pipe sections, often termed sticks, jointed together by a bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joint.</b> Here one end of the pipe stick is flared, termed the bell or socket, to enable {{the opposite end of the}} next stick, the spigot end, to be inserted to create a joint. The gaps in these joints were sealed with oakum to prevents the water leaking out. A molten-lead joint was then run around the socket to ensure that the oakum seal remained in place.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{location}} of broken prestressing wire wraps on the overall strength of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) is investigated here. An advanced computational model based on non-linear finite element analysis is used to study three possible locations of broken wire wraps: at the <b>spigot</b> <b>joint,</b> at the bell joint and in {{the barrel of the}} pipe. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the cracking of the concrete core and the yielding of the prestressing wires and steel cylinder with increasing internal pressure and with an increasing number of broken wire wraps. Two classes of 2. 44 m embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) were modelled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 wire wrap breaks. The results show that broken wire wraps at the joint, and especially the <b>spigot</b> <b>joint,</b> decrease the overall strength of PCCP more so than those at the bell joint or in the barrel of the pipe. The intensity of this effect increases with increasing internal pressure and with a larger number of broken wire wraps. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The section {{mutation}} of a pipe {{affects the}} interior flow field seriously. Numerical simulation of the two-dimensional steady gas flow field of {{two types of}} section mutation pipe was processed. By comparing it with equivalent section pipe’s interior flow field, the effects of section mutation of pipe on pressure distributing and velocity distributing were analyzed. The results are commendably consistent with the theories of one-dimensional adiabatic frictional pipe flow. Ensuring {{the section of the}} compressed gas pipe to be coherent and using the bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joint</b> if necessary are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{annular space}} between bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> for cast iron pipes {{installed}} between 1850 {{and the early}} 1960 s in North America was typically caulked with lead. Lead was caulked unto place using hand-held or pneumatic hammers and special chisels. Historical anecdotal evidence suggests that some bells may have cracked during caulking, especially if the jointer was over zealous in hammering the lead in place or used pneumatic hammers with excessive pressure to produce a tight joint. This paper examines two mechanistic models, one linear and another non-linear, to estimate the levels of hoop stress induced in the bell {{as a consequence of}} lead caulking. Illustrative analyses of lead caulking joints in 16 " and 48 " diameter pipes show that the linear model tends to predict unrealistic high stresses while the non-linear model produced more realistic stresses. Tensile hoop stresses can reach as high as 25...|$|R
40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed previously. Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints.</b> Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints)</b> falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design and Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design for a bolt-on entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast-iron pipe in the current quarter. The drilling assembly for cutting an access hole through the wall of the gas main was also designed, along with a plug assembly to allow removing all tools from the live main and setting a blind flange on the entry fitting prior to burial. These designs are described in detail in the report.

These structures {{have a significant impact}} on the cost, construction rate and safety of the supported permanent structures. However, in recent years a high number of accidents involving bridge falsework systems occurred worldwide. This paper concerns experimental tests of joints of falsework Cuplok® systems. In this paper, the results of 192 tests carried out during the experimental programme will be presented, consisting of five different experiments on three different types of joints. Relevant new results were obtained concerning the bending behaviour and resistance of <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> (used to connect two vertical elements) and of forkhead joints (used to connect the falsework system to the formwork system) from which no published research was found to date. Based on the results, joint models are evaluated and improved empirical analytical models are developed.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the failure analyses of a 302 ̆ 01 d-diameter cast iron main that failed suddenly at the bell 2 ̆ 013 <b>spigot</b> <b>joint</b> in Cleveland, Ohio in March 2008. The main had been operating largely without problems since its installation in 1880. The failure was analyzed using three models developed previously, each of which considered a specific failure mechanism candidate, namely (a) operational load or static analysis, (b) joint failure due to ground movement (settlement), and (c) fatigue failure. Operational load analysis clearly showed that while the factor of safety was significantly reduced {{in the presence of}} a concrete vault installed in 2002 just above the pipe, the margin of safety was still sufficient for the main to have performed safely. Ground movement analysis of the jointed pipe showed that the construction of the concrete vault above the joint of the 302 ̆ 01 d-cast iron main subjected the joint to rotation, which might have ultimately cracked the bell leading to failure. Under this circumstance, two failure scenarios are possible: namely, (a) additional rotation was large enough to cause the bell to split, or (b) additional rotation was sufficient to induce a minor crack in the bell but fatigue (repeated) loading caused the crack to grow over time until the combination of crack length and loading was sufficient to cause the bell to eventually split. The color differences along the fracture surfaces indicated that the fracture occurred in two distinct stages. This observation suggests that the second scenario is more plausible than the first.

Two reports, one describing the program management plan and the other consisting of the technology assessment, were submitted to the DOE COR in the first quarter. Task 2 [...] Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications and Task 3 [...] Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves are now well underway. First-quarter activities included conducting detailed analyses to determine the capabilities of coiled-tubing locomotion for entering and repairing gas mains and the first design iteration of the joint-sealing sleeve. The maximum horizontal reach of coiled tubing inside a pipeline before buckling prevents further access was calculated {{for a wide range}} of coiled-tubing string designs and pipe environments. Work conducted in the second quarter consisted of: (1) selecting a preferred pan/zoom/tilt camera; (2) initiating design of the digital control electronics and switching power supply for the control and operation of the in-pipe robotic modules; (3) continuing design of the repair sleeve and (4) initial testing of the wall-cleaning device. Most recently, activities in the third quarter included: (1) development of the system's pan/zoom/tilt camera control electronics and operating software, and implementing these in the surface and downhole modules and (2) further testing of the wall-cleaning elements used to clean the inside of the bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints.</b> Details of these activities are described in the body of the report along with a summary of events scheduled for the fourth quarter...|$|R
50|$|Spigot and sockets {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the socket. Normal <b>spigot</b> and socket <b>joints</b> do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained <b>spigot</b> and socket <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R

40|$|European {{foundries}} {{master the}} art of mass-producing cast iron pipes in the early 1800 s (Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute 2006 : 1). Slow sand filters, buried pipes with bell and <b>spigot</b> <b>joints,</b> steam powered pumps, and water towers make for a universally applicable technology for urban water supply. Piped water systems enjoy a long service life and modest operational costs but require high initial outlays of capital. Also, pipe laying raises complex right-of-way issues (Meidinger 1980). Around 1850 {{it is by no}} means certain that buried water infrastructure can hold its own against contending modes of urban water supply. Cost-wise it certainly cannot compete against local water sources such as shallow wells and canals. By 1900 however, piped supply is establishing itself as the dominant source of domestic water in European and North American cities. Seventy years on, piped networks are the sole source of urban domestic water. i A parallel network of buried sewers carries the large volumes of piped water away from urban homes. How do piped water and waste technologies come to dominate domestic water regimes in European and North American cities? An early literature attributed the rise of urban piped water and sewerage to an unfolding understanding of the nature of waterborne disease (Baker 1949). Subsequent investigations by urban environment historians show that public health concerns play a minor role only in early 19 th century decisions to embrace piped water infrastructure (Juuti and Katko, 2005; Millward 2004; Tarr et al. 1984; Troesken and Geddes 2003). The introduction of piped water supply, in enabling householders to install waterborne waste removal systems, may arguably even have aggravated waterborne disease (Tarr et al. 1984). ii Urban environment historians place the rise of piped water against a background of rapid industrial and population growth in European and North American towns. The environmental stress accompanying 19 th century industrialisation triggers a crisis of urban water and waste that literally overwhelms city administrations (Tarr 1996). National and state governments respond by, late in the 19 th century, enacting laws and regulations that place responsibility for solving the crisis in urban public health on the shoulders of municipal administrations. City administrations respond by committing to large-scale and centralised technologies for handling urban water and waste. Much of the research published in English focuses, rather unsurprisingly, on the United States and Britain. This article attempts to complements our understanding of the emergence of the piped water paradigm with evidence from the European continent. Here, as elsewhere, waterworks are pioneered by private entrepreneurs under municipal concession contracts. Early concessions confer a limited degree of market power to concessionaires. In most cases the concession amounts to no more than a permit to bury piped systems in municipal soil. Gradually waterworks concessions grow in scope. The public health legislation underlying these arrangements provides concessionaires with a virtual monopoly on domestic water supply in the city. The next two sections sketch the development of piped water and sewerage technologies and the increasing involvement of municipalities with piped supply. Section four turns to the central argument. I show how the deepening commitment of municipal administrations to piped water occasions a shift in the legal brief under which concessionaires operate and the consequences this has for domestic water provision in the city. The final section summarises key points...|$|R
