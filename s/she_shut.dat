25|$|Isabella {{who loved}} {{lingering}} in her bath spent unusually much time there on 28 April. Being hungry, Conrad {{decided to have}} a dinner with Philip of Dreux, {{but by the time he}} arrived at Philip's house, the bishop had already finished his meal. Conrad wanted to return home, but two men ambushed and stabbed him in a narrow street. Most sources agree that they were sent by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins. While dying, Conrad ordered Isabella not to give Tyre to anyone but Richard of England or to the new king of Jerusalem. When Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, who was Philip of France's lieutenant in the Holy Land, urged Isabella to deliver Tyre to him, <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> herself up in the fortress and refused to open its gates.|$|E
500|$|The {{depth of}} the Queen's grief {{over the death of}} her husband {{surprised}} her family, courtiers, politicians and general populace. As when her mother died, <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> herself off from her family—most particularly, the Prince of Wales, (whom she blamed for her husband's death), with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and [...] "lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more." [...] After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married, Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: [...] "I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother." [...] As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence. These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise. However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.|$|E

Prior to this, she had expressed discomfort with attention from the paparazzi on her Myspace blog.

5000|$|Mac Miller's lyrical {{focus and}} subject is {{different}} from that of his previous major mixtape Best Day Ever.

[...] "Desperado" [...] ends with the introduction to [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] by the Beatles. Another feature of Macadelic was its numerous cosigns and guest features. Mac Miller performed alongside Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Joey Bada$$, Sir Michael Rocks of The Cool Kids, Cam'ron, and Juicy J among others.Some of the more popular songs from the mixtape are [...] "Loud", [...] "Thoughts From a Balcony", [...] "Clarity", [...] "Lucky Ass Bitch", [...] "Angels (When <b>She</b> <b>Shuts</b> Her Eyes)", and [...] "The Question".|$|R
