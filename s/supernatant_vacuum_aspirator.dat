Pseudacteon cultellatus and P. obtusus were released {{in the spring and}} fall of 2013. Despite sampling throughout 2014, establishment cannot be confirmed. Two phorid fly sampling methods, hand aspirating and sticky traps, were studied. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>aspirator</b> was compared with two sticky trap configurations. Sticky traps used one of three bait types: live fire ants, dead fire ants, and foraging fire ants. Both P. curvatus and P. tricuspis were captured, but many more P. curvatus were caught than P. tricuspis. Foraging fire ant-baited traps caught relatively few flies. In contrast, live ant and dead ant-baited traps captured many flies, with dead ant-baited traps performing better overall. A lab study was performed to investigate possible competition among flies that were released in Arkansas because P. curvatus has been reported to competitively displace P. tricuspis in other states. Pseudacteon curvatus was paired with P. obtusus and P. cultellatus in parasitization trials. Host size, sex ratios, species ratios, and development times were recorded to evaluate possible competitive interactions between species. Due to a shortage of P. cultellatus at the Florida Department of Agriculture rearing lab, this species was not analyzed. Pseudacteon curvatus host sizes did not vary by sex but P. obtusus hosts were smaller for males than for P. obtusus females.

Good understanding of dengue transmission sites is a critical factor to implement effective vector control measures. METHODS: A cohort of 1, 811 students from 10 schools in rural, semi-rural and semi-urban Thailand participated in this study. Seroconversion data and location of participants' residences and schools were recorded to determine spatial patterns of dengue infections. Blood samples were taken to confirm dengue infections in participants at the beginning and the end of school term. Entomological factors included a survey of adult mosquito density using a portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>aspirator</b> during the school term and a follow up survey of breeding sites of Aedes vectors in schools after the school term. Clustering analyses were performed to detect spatial aggregation of dengue infections among participants. RESULTS: A total of 57 dengue seroconversions were detected among the 1, 655 participants who provided paired blood samples. Of the 57 confirmed dengue infections, 23 (40. 0 %) occurred in students from 6 (6. 8 %) of the 88 classrooms in 10 schools. Dengue infections did not show significant clustering by residential location in the study area. During the school term, a total of 66 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were identified from the 278 mosquitoes caught in 50 classrooms of the 10 schools. In a follow-up survey of breeding sites, 484 out of 2, 399 water containers surveyed (20. 2 %) were identified as active mosquito breeding sites. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dengue infections were clustered among schools and among classrooms within schools. The schools studied were found to contain a large number of different types of breeding sites. Aedes vector densities in schools were correlated with dengue infections and breeding sites in those schools.

40|$|Abstract Background Ghana {{has a high}} {{maternal}} mortality rate of 540 per 100 000. Although abortion complications usually are treatable, the risks of morbidity and death increase when treatment is delayed. Delay in care may occur when women have difficulty accessing treatment because health care providers are not trained, equipped, or willing to treat the complications of abortion. Gaps in the midwifery tutors' knowledge on comprehensive abortion care (CAC) have resulted in most midwives in Ghana not knowing the legal indications under which safe abortion care can be provided, and lacking the skills and competencies for CAC services. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the capacity and willingness of midwifery tutors to teach contraception, post abortion care and legal termination in Ghana. Methods This study focused on all 14 midwifery schools in the country. A total of 74 midwifery tutors were interviewed for this study. Structured self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. The data were entered and checked for consistencies using Epiinfo 6. 04 and analyzed using Stata 8. Descriptive analysis was used and frequencies reported with percentages. Results In total, 74 midwifery tutors were interviewed. Of these, 66 (89. 2 %) were females. The tutors had mainly been trained as midwives (51. 4 %) and graduate nurses (33. 8 %). Respondents were predominantly Christians (97. 3 %). The study discovered that only 18. 9 % of the tutors knew all the legal indications under which safe abortion care could be provided. The content of pre-service training of tutors did not include uterine evacuation with manual <b>vacuum</b> <b>aspirator</b> (MVA). The study also highlighted some factors that influence midwifery tutors' willingness to teach comprehensive abortion care. It was also revealed that personal and religious beliefs greatly influence teaching of Comprehensive Abortion Care. Conclusion The findings of this survey suggest that the majority of tutors did not know the abortion law in Ghana as well as the Ghana Health Service Reproductive Health Standards and Protocol. Thus, there is a need to enhance their capacities to teach the present pre-service students the necessary skills to offer CAC after school and to understand related issues such as related legal matters. </p...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Unwanted {{pregnancy}} and unsafe abortion {{continue to be}} a major public health problem in Uganda. This study has demonstrated that the problem of abortion is still on the increase particularly among young women. A variety of demographic and socioeconomic factors – poverty and hardship, earlier start of sexual relations, shifts from rural to urban settings, influence of the media and limited accessibility and availability of effective contraception have contributed to the increase in premarital sexual activity and early pregnancy. Information about sexuality, safe sexual practices and contraception is often lacking. Responding to the needs of young women, particularly adolescents becomes difficult. This has resulted in many unintended pregnancies, a proportion of which have been terminated by unsafe abortion because of the legal restrictions. Other young women have had no other option than to continue the pregnancies – with all the attendant social and educational consequences. The study has filled a critical gap in knowledge regarding abortion complications presenting at Soroti Referral Hospital despite the limitations of projecting the incidence of abortion complications using hospital-based data. The results of the study are indeed a proof to the opinion that abortion is a common and increasing problem in rural areas too. The morbidity and mortality levels related to abortion which have been revealed by this study call for a concerted effort in prevention of unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortion. This should be made a high priority if the goal of improving women’s reproductive health is to be achieved. It will remain important to study and monitor unsafe abortion so that trends can be assessed, efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy evaluated, and preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with abortion identified and reduced. The problem of abortion in Uganda is mainly linked to limited access to family planning services and lack of reliable information about modern contraception. A simple answer to the issue of unsafe abortion would be to guarantee universal access and availability of family planning information, education and services for all eligible couples and individuals, including sexually active adolescents. Effective sex education programmes which target teenagers in-and-out of school should be instituted, and must include correct information about reproduction and contraception. Dissemination of reliable information to even the most distant areas of the districts remain the sole responsibility of the district directorates of health and the health sub-districts in light of the decentralization policy on health services. In addition, all health centres should be equipped with adequate stocks of modern contraceptives if they have trained staff who can offer the services. The methods should be responsive to the needs and preferences of clients. Prevention of repeat abortions through provision of compassionate counseling and a range of contraceptive methods to women treated for abortion-related complications is paramount. The hospital should eliminate the administrative and physical separation between emergency treatment of abortion complications and family planning services. Many women expressed the desire to receive family planning counseling or methods after being treated for abortion complications. However, the fact that a woman had to get dressed, walk a cross a courtyard to the family planning clinic, check in, wait to be seen and undergo another examination impedes the provision of postabortion family planning. Many women – particularly those who were weak, in pain or emotionally drained – decided to go home instead of enduring this time-consuming and sometimes intimidating process. Starting this service in the gynaecological ward will be a step forward towards prevention of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortion. The high prevalence of abortion complications in the hospital which is relatively understaffed overwhelms services. There are more patients than staff can treat in a reasonable time. To back up the few staff who have received training on postabortion care, the hospital needs to liaise with Ministry of Health to arrange training especially for registered midwives and clinical officers on postabortion care. This will improve the initial clinical assessment and examination of abortion patients with complications when they arrive to the gynaecological ward for treatment. The treatment protocol on first trimester incomplete abortion needs to be changed. Since the hospital already has a manual <b>vacuum</b> <b>aspirator,</b> ensuring its use on incomplete abortion patients in first trimester would reduce the average length of patient stay and the high treatment costs that both the hospital and the patients meet. The advantages of using a manual <b>vacuum</b> <b>aspirator</b> (MVA) versus the traditional dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedure have already been outlined. However, it must be reemphasized that it will promote the immediate provision of postabortion family planning services in the gynaecological ward if the hospital started offering these services. Regarding the high death toll resulting especially from severe haemorrhage and with the knowledge that safe blood in some occasions becomes difficult to secure in the hospital, expansion of the existing blood bank to cater for the high demand for safe blood is an avoidable necessity. This would help reduce even the countless deaths that happen when patients have to find themselves being referred for blood transfusion from Soroti hospital to other health facilities. Sound information is a prerequisite for health action. Without data on the dimensions, impact and significance of a health problem it is neither possible to create an advocacy case nor to establish strong programmes for addressing it. Soroti hospital administration should take a leading role in computerizing its records department and train the responsible staff in basic computer packages. The financial allocation by Ministry of Health to Regional Referral Hospitals also needs to be revisited. A hospital with a very high patient load cannot operate without drugs for three weeks each month. The Government of Uganda ought to know that a healthy population is a potential resource for the country’s development. Last but not least, the call to make abortion legal may not yield much at this stage. Many respondents had a negative opinion on termination of a pregnancy that resulted from contraception failure. As outlined in the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt and at the follow-up conference in New York, USA; the immediate priority in Uganda still remains making abortion services available to the full extent permitted by the law. The government and people of Uganda need to extend the spirit that made them score good results in their battle against HIV/AIDS to yet another campaign against unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortion...|$|R

Coefficients of albumen and yolk volume expansion were. 43 X 10 and. 78 X 10, respectively. When ex-pansion characteristics of both albumen and yolk are considered, 42 to 53 % of the expansion occurred in the first minute. Volume expansion after 15 min was linear as temperature was in-creased from 29 C to 39 and 49 C. Contraction occurred with a rate similar to that for expansion. Removal of gases from the albumen using <b>aspirator</b> <b>vacuum</b> tended to increase volume ex-pansion. Storage of eggs for up to 21 days at different temperatures followed by expansion of albumen and yolk at 39 C produced no differences in the yolk.

These methods allow probing physical proximities between chromatin elements without specifically identifying the protein components that mediate such interactions. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) technology, which combines multiple techniques to identify the proteins that bridge distant genomic regions, while simultaneously identifying such physical proximities. This method is also useful for determining if a candidate protein might mediate long-range interactions, both in cis and in trans in the nucleus. We discuss how the 6 C technique can be incorporated with other techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that interact with a given gene or chromatin region of interest in a specific protein-dependent manner. Such information allows complete, cell-type-specific mapping of all the chromatin interactions mediated by specific proteins. The 6 C assay advances {{our understanding of the}} three-dimensional aspects of the higher-order folding of chromatin and provides an important tool to examine the role of specific proteins in nuclear organization. In addition to providing a detailed protocol of the 6 C technique, we discuss how this technology can be used by investigators working in the area of chromatin biology, with special interest in chromatin long-range interactions. ### RELATED INFORMATION The 6 C assay combines three different methodologies: chromosome conformation capture (3 C) (Dekker et al. 2002), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and cloning (Fig. 1). The first step involves conventional 3 C methodology: The chromatin is cross-linked, digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. Immediately after ligation, the chromatin is immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the protein of interest (i. e., the suspected “bridging protein” or the protein whose mediating physical proximities the investigator wishes to map). Thereafter, the cross-links are reversed, and the DNA is purified further. The fragments obtained are then cloned into a vector harboring the same restriction enzyme site overhangs that were generated in the enzyme digestion step of the 3 C portion of the protocol. The clones are further screened by digestion with the same restriction enzyme. Ideally, clones showing multiple inserts will result from the intramolecular ligation and should represent physical proximities involving the protein targeted in the immunoprecipitation steps. These clones are chosen for sequencing to reveal the identity of the partners. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Summary of the Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) method.

Grow 2 × 10 e 7 cells of the cell type of interest in an appropriate medium and under suitable conditions until they are 70 %- 80 % confluent. - Add 0. 86 mL of 37 % formaldehyde (to a final concentration of 2 %) directly to a cell culture dish containing 15 mL of medium. Swirl gently to mix. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature. - Add 1. 057 mL of 2 M glycine (to a final concentration of 0. 125 M) to the dishes. Swirl gently to mix. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. - Aspirate the medium. Wash the cells with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail. - Prepare 0. 2 X trypsin diluted in PBS, and add 5 mL of it to the cells. Incubate in 5 % CO 2 for 5 min at 37 °C. - Neutralize the trypsin with 10 mL of 10 % fetal bovine serum. - Scrape the cells from the plate. Transfer them to 50 -mL tubes. - *Optionally, scrape a second time with PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail*. - Collect the cells by centrifuging at 1300 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C. - Wash twice with 10 mL of PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Working on ice, pipette gently to make a single-cell suspension. - *After resuspending the second time, count the cells before centrifugation*. - Add 10 mL of cellular lysis solution containing protease inhibitor cocktail to the cells. Mix gently by pipetting. Incubate for 10 min on ice. - *Monitor lysis by observing an aliquot under a microscope. These conditions should be sufficient for most cell types. However, certain cell types might need different incubation times and/or different strengths of the buffer for complete lysis*. - Centrifuge at 1800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.|$|R
