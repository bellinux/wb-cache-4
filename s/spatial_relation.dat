Then we vectorize <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> (edges) for clustering and quantization. As the targeted application, we extract the repetitive sub-graphs (graphical symbols) composed of graphemes and learned <b>spatial</b> <b>relations.</b> On two handwriting databases, a simple mathematical expression database and a complex flowchart database, the unsupervised <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> outperform the predefined <b>spatial</b> <b>relations.</b> In addition, we visualize the frequent patterns on two text-lines containing Chinese characters...|$|R

If, as science and common sense assume, there is one public all-embracing physical space in which physical objects are, the relative positions of physical objects in physical space must more or less correspond to the relative positions of sense-data in our private spaces. There is no difficulty in supposing {{this to be the}} case. If we see on a road one house nearer to us than another, our other senses will bear out the view that it is nearer; for example, it will be reached sooner if we walk along the road. Other people will agree that the house which looks nearer to us is nearer; the ordnance map will take the same view; and thus everything points to a <b>spatial</b> <b>relation</b> between the houses corresponding to the relation between the sense-data which we see {{when we look at the}} houses.

40|$|Behavioral {{research}} indicates that successful face individuation is associated with sensitivity to subtle <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> between facial features, {{as well as to}} the features themselves. We used a blocked functional magnetic resonance adaptation paradigm to examine the sensitivity of the core face network to <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> in faces. The fusiform face area (FFA) was sensitive to <b>spatial</b> <b>relations,</b> responding more strongly to a single face presented with various feature spacings than to repeated presentations of an identical face. This response to spacing variations was as strong as the response to a series of distinct identities. There were no hemisphere effects in sensitivity to <b>spatial</b> <b>relations,</b> although FFAs were larger on the right. The right occipital face area (OFA) was also sensitive to <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> in faces. Few participants showed left OFAs. The superior temporal sulcus (STS), which does not code identity, showed little sensitivity to either relational changes or changes in identity.

Participants learned geometrically regular or irregular layouts of objects while {{standing at the edge}} or in the middle, and then pointed to objects while blindfolded in three conditions: before turning (baseline), after rotating 240 degrees (updating), and after disorientation (disorientation). The internal consistency of pointing in the disorientation condition was equivalent to that in the updating condition when participants learned the regular layout. The internal consistency of pointing was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the irregular layout. However when participants who learned the regular layout were instructed to use self-to-object <b>spatial</b> <b>relations,</b> the effect of disorientation on pointing consistency appeared. When participants who learned the irregular layout at the periphery of the layout were instructed to use object-to-object <b>spatial</b> <b>relations,</b> the effect of disorientation disappeared. These results suggest that people represent both self-to-object and object-to-object <b>spatial</b> <b>relations,</b> and primarily use object-to-object spatial representation in a regular layout and self-to-object spatial representation in an irregular layout.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{overview}} of our on-going work using <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> for mobile robot navigation. Using the histogram of forces, we show how linguistic expressions can be generated to describe a qualitative view of the robot with respect to its environment. The linguistic expressions provide a symbolic link between the robot and a human user, thus facilitating two-way, human-like communication. In this paper, we present two ways in which <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> can be used for robot navigation. First, egocentric <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> provide a robot-centered view of the environment (e. g., there is an object on the left). Navigation can be described in terms of <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> (e. g., move forward while there is an object on the left, then turn right), such that a complete navigation task is generated as a sequence of navigation states with corresponding behaviors. Second, <b>spatial</b> <b>relations</b> can be used to analyze maps and facilitate their use in communicating navigation tasks. For example, the user can draw an approximate map on a PDA and then draw the desired robot trajectory also on the PDA, relative to the map. <b>Spatial</b> <b>relations</b> can then be used to convert the relative trajectory to a corresponding navigation behavior sequence. Examples are included using a comparable scene from both a robot environment and a PDAsketched trajectory showing the corresponding generated linguistic spatial expressions.
