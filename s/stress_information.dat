40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{strategic}} incentive to reveal meaningful information by the agent {{who is involved}} in the competitive environment. In the model, an agent (M) who is imperfectly informed about the unknown true state has the option to act as the leader or act simultaneously with the uninformed one through a delay. His signal and its precision are private information. As M’s action conveys his private signal, M’s decision on the timing of action is no more than the decision on the spillover of his information. Which type (quality) of information is revealed depends on the asymmetry in reward and penalty of the payoff structure. If the penalty is stressed or the reward is weakly <b>stressed,</b> <b>information</b> is revealed only if it is of low quality. On the other hand, if the reward is strongly <b>stressed,</b> <b>information</b> is revealed even though or only if it is of high quality. In addition, the followings are shown that i) the asymmetry in reward and penalty is a necessary condition for the spillover of M’s information and ii) the incomplete information about M’s information quality is a necessary condition for the spillover of his very precise information...|$|R

50|$|Influence from L1 to L2 {{was also}} found in stress {{placement}} on words. Hungarian learners of English tend to place initial stress on English words {{that do not have}} initial stress, because Hungarian has fixed initial stress and this is transferred to Hungarian speakers' L2 English prosody (Archibald, 1995; 1998a; 1998b). Spanish speakers of English were found not to stress target stressed syllables in English, and this might be {{due to the lack of}} stress in Spanish cognates and the lexical similarity between Spanish and English words (Flege and Bohn, 1989). In addition, it is suggested that speakers of tone languages (e.g., Chinese) and pitch-accent languages (e.g., Japanese), both of which use pitch as a phonologically meaningful item, do not compute stress placement in English, but rather store the <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> lexically (Archibald, 1997).|$|E
50|$|Strand-seq (single strand sequencing) {{was first}} {{described}} in 2012 as {{a technique to}} isolate sequenced reads from parental template strands in single-cell DNA libraries. As a proof of concept study, the authors demonstrated the ability to acquire sequence information from the Watson and/or Crick chromosomal strands in an individual DNA library, depending on the mode of chromatid segregation; a typical DNA library will always contain DNA from both strands. The authors were specifically interested in showing the utility of strand-seq in detecting sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) at high-resolution. They successfully identified eight putative SCEs in the murine (mouse) embryonic stem (meS) cell line with resolution up to 23 bp. This methodology {{has also been shown}} to hold great utility in discerning patterns of non-random chromatid segregation, especially in stem cell lineages. Furthermore, SCEs have been implicated as diagnostic indicators of genome <b>stress,</b> <b>information</b> that has utility in cancer biology. Most research on this topic involves observing the assortment of chromosomal template strands through many cell development cycles and correlating non-random assortment with particular cell fates. Single-cell sequencing protocols were foundational in the development of this technique, but they differ in several aspects.|$|E
40|$|Listeners use {{suprasegmental}} auditory lexical <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> {{to resolve}} the competition words engage in during spoken-word recognition. The present study investigated whether (a) visual speech provides lexical <b>stress</b> <b>information,</b> and, more importantly, (b) whether this visual lexical <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> is used to resolve lexical competition. Dutch word pairs that differ in the lexical stress realization of their first two syllables, but not segmentally (e. g., 'OCtopus ' and 'okTOber'; capitals marking primary stress) served as auditory-only, visual-only, and audiovisual speech primes. These primes either matched (e. g., 'OCto-'), mismatched (e. g., 'okTO-'), or were unrelated to (e. g., 'maCHI-') a subsequent printed target (octopus), which participants {{had to make a}} lexical decision to. To the degree that visual speech contains lexical <b>stress</b> <b>information,</b> lexical decisions to printed targets should be modulated through the addition of visual speech.

This information provision is generally considered as likely to ultimately improve environmental quality. We suggest a new and complementary way to consider information-based instruments.

We show that, beyond an optimum level, an additional information load, regardless of the information quality, could {{do more harm than}} good. Indeed, some perverse effects could occur, resulting in a worse overall impact.

SPORT 'sport') when {{the spoken word}} was mis-stressed. The adverse effect of mis-stressing confirms the role of <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> in lexical recognition in Dutch. However, although the erroneous stress pattern was always initially compatible with a competing word (e. g. ATlas, 'atlas'), mis-stressed words did not produced high false alarm rates in unrelated pairs (e. g. SPORT - atLAS).

40|$|Segmental {{as well as}} {{suprasegmental}} {{information is}} used by Dutch listeners to recognize words. The time-course {{of the effect of}} suprasegmental <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> on spoken-word recognition was investigated in a previous study, in which we tracked Dutch listeners' looks to arrays of four printed words as they listened to spoken sentences. Each target was displayed along with a competitor that did not differ segmentally in its first two syllables but differed in stress placement (e. g., 'CENtimeter' and 'sentiMENT'). The listeners' eye-movements showed that <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> is used to recognize the target before distinct segmental information is available. Here, we examine the role of durational information in this effect. Two experiments showed that initial-syllable duration, as a cue to lexical stress, is not interpreted dependent on the speaking rate of the preceding carrier sentence. This still held when other stress cues like pitch and amplitude were removed. Rather, the speaking rate of the preceding carrier affected the speed of word recognition globally, even though the rate of the target itself was not altered. <b>Stress</b> <b>information</b> modulated lexical competition, but did so independently of the rate of the preceding carrier, even if duration was the only stress cue present...|$|E

40|$|In {{languages}} with variable stress placement, lexical stress patterns can convey {{information about}} word identity. The experiments reported here {{address the question}} of whether lexical <b>stress</b> <b>information</b> can be used in word recognition. The results allow the following conclusions: 1. Prior information as to the number of syllables and lexical stress patterns of words and nonwords does not facilitate lexical decision responses (Experiment 1). 2. The strong correspondences between grammatical category membership and stress pattern in bisyllabic English words (strong-weak stress being associated primarily with nouns, weak-strong with verbs) are not exploited in the recognition of isolated words (Experiment 2). 3. When a change in lexical stress also involves a change in vowel quality, i. e., a segmental as well as a suprasegmental alteration, effects on word recognition are greater when no segmental correlates of suprasegmental changes are involved (Experiments 2 and 3). 4.
