40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the U. S. federally implemented Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) on states’ solar energy installation and utilization. In particular, I compare relative trends in solar installation and utilization between <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> higher levels of solar and <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> lower levels of solar, before and after the implementation of the Solar ITC. My findings demonstrate that <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> higher levels of solar prior to 2006 — the year the Solar ITC took effect — experienced rapid, significant growth in solar installation and utilization relative to <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> lower levels of solar, on average. These results suggest that the Solar ITC had a larger effect on solar installation and utilization in <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> higher levels of solar compared to <b>states</b> with <b>initially</b> lower levels of solar, on average...|$|R

The third and final movement is built on four themes, derived from what Lilburn once called [...] "the naive, generous country that gave one its joyous force".|$|E

5000|$|The Egyptian Revolution of 2011, {{part of the}} Arab Spring, led to fears in Israel {{about the}} future of the treaty. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <b>stated</b> <b>initially</b> that he {{expected}} any new Egyptian government to adhere to the peace treaty with Israel, as it had served both countries well. After the Egyptian Army took power on 11 February 2011, it announced that Egypt would continue to abide by all its international and regional treaties. Yet Israeli-Egyptian relations reached their lowest level since the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability following the rise of terrorist activity in the Sinai Peninsula and following hostility manifestation from masses of Egyptian protesters against Israel in the streets of Cairo.|$|E

[...] In November, Haasan stated that he hopes to release the film by 2016, but the release of the film is on hold due to the financial crisis of the producer even though some combination scenes as well as VFX are pending.

Hürriyet newspaper reports that he was accused of being the leader of the coup attempt. Although the semi-official news agency Anadolu <b>stated,</b> <b>initially,</b> that Öztürk confessed to a prosecutor that his intention was to execute a coup, this news later disappeared, and according to the private broadcaster NTV, Öztürk denied any involvement with the coup plotters. In his statement to the prosecutor, he claimed that he happened to be on the airbase visiting his grandchildren (his son-in-law is a pilot stationed there) and, having learned of the coup attempt, successfully dissuaded the plotters from continuing with their plans and personally rescued two senior, loyal officers who were being held at the base.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} {{statement}} of the theme, the piano plays octaves on B. The opening motives, again played by the strings, becomes more chromatic and unsettling, until finally coming {{to rest on the}} dominant of C, G major. The viola and violin play pizzicato octaves on E-natural before the strings cascade down the C harmonic minor scale that ushers in the first theme, stated forte. After a brief development of this theme, an ascending gesture based on sixteenth-notes alternating between the notes of a minor second serves as the transition to the second theme in the relative major of C minor, E major. This second theme is an uplifting eight-measure theme <b>stated</b> <b>initially</b> in the piano alone. Brahms then uses the technique of theme and variations to construct four variations on this theme, each eight measures long. A short idea based on the opening theme closes the exposition, which is not repeated.|$|E

Until {{today it is}} still not clear what a BME does represent (Roemer et al. 2009, 2014; Zanetti et al. 2000) and the evidence for the impact on outcome is conflicting. While Niemeyer (Niemeyer et al. 2010) <b>stated</b> <b>initially</b> that BME at time of ACI is connected to a decreased clinical outcome, the opposite has just lately been reported by Ebert (Ebert et al. 2014). Furthermore, Nemec (Nemec et al. 2009) and Salzmann (Salzmann et al. 2014) have reported that a regional BME is very frequent following cartilage repair (OCT and ACI, respectively), but not connected to clinical or MRI outcome.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of the {{monotone}} Newton theorem (MNT) it has been conjectured that discretised Brown iterations converge at least as fast as discretised Newton iterations, because such is the case for analytic iterations. With easily verified hypotheses, it is proved here that Brown analytic iterations converge strictly faster than Newton ones. As a consequence, the same result holds for discretised iterations with conveniently small incremental steps. However, in the general context of the MNT, it may happen that Newton's discretised method converges faster than Brown's, but this situation can be remedied in many cases by conveniently shifting the initial value, so that those hypotheses ensuring the reverse are satisfied. Thus, a fairly effective solution is given to the problem <b>stated</b> <b>initially...</b>|$|E
