During Quarter 12 (July [...] September 1995), work continued on the Subtask 3. 2 in-plant testing of the Microcel{trademark} flotation column at Lady Dunn. Under Subtask 4. 4, additional toxic trace element analysis of column flotation samples finalized the data set. Data analysis indicates that reasonably good mass balances were achieved for most elements.

In Part 1 of this series of papers, it was shown that a definite amount of air had {{to be present in}} a laboratory mixing unit which produced a moderate shear rate in order to form compact, spherical agglomerates in an aqueous suspension of moderately hydrophobic coal using heptane or hexadecane as an agglomerate. In this paper, the effects of different amounts of air including dissolved air are discussed.

40|$|Fluidized beds {{comprise}} {{a quantity of}} solid particles that is suspended by an upward flowing gas. They are used {{for a variety of}} processes in the chemical industry, such as catalytic reactions, drying, coating and energy conversion. A major problem in industrial practice is the occurrence of unwanted agglomeration, i. e. solid particles adhering to each other and forming larger agglomerates. The formation of agglomerates is a consequence of the presence of a liquid phase that results in increased particle stickiness. If this effect is not detected and counteracted it can eventually result in defluidization of the bed and subsequent costly shut-down of the whole installation. In energy conversion processes, typically combustion and gasification, agglomeration is often one of the main bottlenecks in the course of switching from fossil fuel to biomass as a regenerative energy source. This work aims at identification and application of suitable methods for the early detection of and counteraction against agglomeration in fluidized bed energy conversion processes. The attractor comparison method has been developed previously for monitoring multiphase hydrodynamics. This method is based on a relative comparison of the state-space projections of pressure fluctuation measurements and indicates significant changes in the hydrodynamics. In this work, the method is investigated for its suitability to detect agglomeration and small changes in particle size in circulating fluidized beds. The method has shown to be sensitive to agglomeration on lab-scale and sensitive to small particle size changes on both lab-scale and industrial scale. It is therefore considered a cost-saving tool for industrial practice. Moreover, a screening methodology has been developed that allows the efficient identification of signal analysis methods that are sensitive for and <b>selective</b> to <b>agglomeration.</b> This screening methodology has been successfully applied to identify suitable methods for several case studies in different scale bubbling and circulating fluidized beds. Defluidization of the bed has shown to be successfully prevented using the attractor comparison method in combination with suitable agglomeration counteraction methods on both lab- and pilot plant scale. The suitability of different agglomeration counteraction methods has been assessed. Applied Science...|$|R

The project began in October, 1992, and is scheduled for completion by June 1997. During Quarter 14 (January [...] March 1996), parametric testing of the 30 -inch Microcel{trademark} flotation column at the Lady Dunn Plant continued under Subtask 3. 2. Subtask 3. 3 testing, investigating a novel Hydrophobic Dewatering process (HD), continued this quarter with parametric testing of the batch dewatering unit. Coal product moistures of 3 to 12 percent were achieved, with higher percent solids slurry feeds resulting in lower product moistures. For a given percent solids feed, the product moisture decreased with increasing butane to dry coal ratios. Stirring time, stirring rate, and settling time were all found to have {{little effect on the}} final moisture content.

40|$|Bechtel, {{together}} with Amax Research and Development Center (Amax R&D), has prepared this study which provides conceptual cost {{estimates for the}} production of premium quality coal-water slurry fuel (CWF) in a commercial plant. Two scenarios are presented, one using column flotation technology and the other the <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> to clean the coal to the required quality specifications. This study forms part of US Department of Energy program ï¿½Engineering Development of Advanced Physical Fine Coal Cleaning for Premium Fuel Applications,ï¿½ (Contract No. DE-AC 22 - 92 PC 92208), under Task 11, Project Final Report. The primary objective of the Department of Energy program is to develop the design base for prototype commercial advanced fine coal cleaning facilities capable of producing ultra-clean coals suitable for conversion to stable and highly loaded CWF. The fuels should contain less than 2 lb ash/MBtu (860 grams ash/GJ) of HHV and preferably less than 1 lb ash/MBtu (430 grams ash/GJ). The advanced fine coal cleaning technologies to be employed are advanced column froth flotation and <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration.</b> It is further stipulated that operating conditions during the advanced cleaning process should recover not less than 80 percent of the carbon content (heating value) in the run-of-mine source coal. These goals for ultra-clean coal quality are to be met under the constraint that annualized coal production costs does not exceed $ 2. 5 /MBtu ($ 2. 37 /GJ), including the mine mouth cost of the raw coal. A further objective of the program is to determine the distribution of a selected suite of eleven toxic trace elements between product CWF and the refuse stream of the cleaning processes. Laboratory, bench-scale and Process Development Unit (PDU) tests to evaluate advanced column flotation and <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> were completed earlier under this program with selected coal samples. A PDU with a capacity of 2 st/h was designed by Bechtel and installed at Amax R&D, Golden, Colorado by Entech Global for process evaluation tests. The tests successfully demonstrated the capability of advanced column flotation as well as <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> to produce ultra-clean coal at specified levels of purity and recovery efficiency. Test results and the experience gained during the operation of the PDU have provided valuable insights into the processes studied. Based on the design data obtained from the test work and a set of project design criteria, two sets of conceptual designs for commercial CWF production plants have been developed, one using column flotation and the other using <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> process. Using these designs, Capital as well as Operating and Maintenance (O&M) cost estimates for the plants have been compiled.

During Quarter 13 (October [...] December 1995), testing of the GranuFlow dewatering process indicated a 3 [...] 4 % reduction in cake moisture for screen-bowl and solid-bowl centrifuge products. The Orimulsion additions were also found to reduce the potential dustiness of the fine coal, as well as improve solids recovery in the screen-bowl centrifuge. Based on these results, Lady Dunn management now plans to use a screen bowl centrifuge to dewater their Microcel{trademark} column froth product. Subtask 3. 3 testing, investigating a novel Hydrophobic Dewatering process (HD), continued this quarter.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was the {{engineering}} development of two advanced physical fine coal cleaning processes, column flotation and <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration,</b> for premium fuel applications. The project scope included laboratory research and bench-scale testing of both processes on six coals to optimize the processes, followed by the design, construction, and operation of a 2 t/hr process development unit (PDU). The project began in October, 1992, and is scheduled for completion by September 1997. This report summarizes the findings of all the <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> (SA) test work performed with emphasis {{on the results of}} the PDU SA Module testing. Two light hydrocarbons, heptane and pentane, were tested as agglomerants in the laboratory research program which investigated two reactor design concepts: a conventional two-stage agglomeration circuit and a unitized reactor that combined the high- and low-shear operations in one vessel. The results were used to design and build a 25 lb/hr bench-scale unit with two-stage agglomeration. The unit also included a steam stripping and condensation circuit for recovery and recycle of heptane. It was tested on six coals to determine the optimum grind and other process conditions that resulted in the recovery of about 99 % of the energy while producing low ash (1 - 2 lb/MBtu) products. The fineness of the grind was the most important variable with the D 80 (80 % passing size) varying in the 12 to 68 micron range. All the clean coals could be formulated into coal-water-slurry-fuels with acceptable properties. The bench-scale results were used for the conceptual and detailed design of the PDU SA Module which was integrated with the existing grinding and dewatering circuits. The PDU was operated for about 9 months. During the first three months, the shakedown testing was performed to fine tune the operation and control of various equipment. This was followed by parametric testing, optimization/confirmatory testing, and finally a 72 -hour round the clock production run {{for each of the three}} project coals (Hiawatha, Taggart, and Indiana VII). The parametric testing results confirmed that the Taggart coal ground to a D 80 of 30 microns could be cleaned to 1 lb ash/MBtu, whereas the Hiawatha and Indiana Vil coals had to be ground to D 80 s of 40 and 20 microns, respectively, to be cleaned to 2 lb ash/MBtu. The percent solids, residence time, shear intensity (impeller tip speed and energy input per unit volume), and heptane dosage were the main variables that affected successful operation (phase inversion or microagglomerate formation in the high-shear reactor and their growth to 2 - 3 mm in size during low shear). Downward inclination of the vibrating screen and adequate spray water helped produce the low ash products. Btu recoveries were consistently greater than 98 %. Two-stage steam stripping achieved about 99 % heptane recovery for recycle to the process. Residual hydrocarbon concentrations were in the 3000 to 5000 ppm range on a dry solids basis...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary digital design {{techniques}} are powerful, but disjoint. There are myriad emerging ways of manipulating design components, and generating both functional forms and formal functions. With {{the combination of}} <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration,</b> sequencing, and heuristics, {{it is possible to}} use these techniques to focus on optimizing performance criteria, and selecting for defined characteristics. With these techniques, complex, performance oriented systems can emerge, with minimal input and high effectiveness and e""ciency. These processes depend on iterative loops for stability and directionality, and are the basis for optimization and refinement. They begin to approach cybernetic principles of self-organization and equilibrium. By rapidly looping this process, design âattractorsââ shared solution componentsâbecome visible and accessible. In the past, we have been dedicated to selecting the contents of the design space. With these tools, we can now ask, what are the inputs to the design process, what is the continuum or spectrum of design inputs, and what are the selection criteria for the success of a design-aspect? These new questions allow for a greater coherence within a particular cognitive model for the designed and desired object. There are ways of using optimization criteria that enable design freedom within these boundaries, while enforcing constraints and maintaining consistency for selected processes and product aspects.

Three compliance steam coals, Taggart, Indiana VII and Hiawatha, were processed in the PDU to determine performance and design parameters for commercial production of premium fuel by advanced flotation. Consistent, reliable performance of the PDU was demonstrated by 72 -hr production runs on each of the test coals. Its capacity generally was limited by the dewatering capacity of the clean coal filters during the production runs rather than by the flotation capacity of the Microcel column. The residual concentrations of As, Pb, and Cl were reduced by at least 25 % on a heating value basis from their concentrations in the test coals. The reduction in the concentrations of Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Mn, Hg, Ni and Se varied from coal to coal but the concentrations of most were greatly reduced from the concentrations in the ROM parent coals.

Archaeocyte is generally considered as the toti/multipotent âstem cellsâ in sponges. They {{have the capacity to}} proliferate and to differentiate into other cell types. To investigate the interaction between archaeocyte with other predominant cell types in marine sponge, such as pinacocyte and collencyte, we separated the archaeocytes, pinacocytes and collencytes from the marine sponge Hymeniacidon perleve by a method composed of differential centrifugation, <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration,</b> differential adhesion and Ficoll-Vrografin density gradient centrifugation (Sun et al., 2007). The pinacocytes and collencytes (in a ratio of 1 : 1, denoted together as PCs) mixed with archaeocytes in ratio of 1 : 2, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1, respectivelywere cultured in seawater. The results showed that PCs could aggregate and adhere to the substratum, but they could not develop into small sponge. Archaeocytes could form suspended aggregates, not functional sponges. When PCs and archaeocytes were mixed together, especially in a ratio of 2 : 1, almost all of the sponge cells aggregated and adhered quickly. Moreover, a series of self-organization and differentiation phenomena could be observed, such as secretion of collagen fibre and silicon spicules, construction of canal systems, outward movement of archaeocytes and final formation of functional sponges.

Results have been analyzed in the light of widely accepted theories and some recently developed approaches. A mixture composed of drug, some excipients and a dry binder was processed using a lab-scale high- shear mixer. Three common active pharmaceutical ingredients (paracetamol, caffeine and acetylsalicylic acid) were used within the initial formulation. Drug load was 50 % (on weight basis). Influences of drug particle properties (e. g. particle size and shape, hygroscopicity) on the granule growth behaviour were evaluated. Particle size distribution (PSD) and granule morphology were monitored during the entire process through sieve analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) image analysis. Resistance of the wet mass to mixing was furthermore measured using the impeller torque monitoring technique. The observed differences in the granule growth behaviour as well as the discrepancies between the actual and the ideal drug content in the final granules have been interpreted in terms of dimensionless quantity (spray flux number, bed penetration time) and related to torque measurements. Analysis highlighted the role of liquid distribution on the process. It was demonstrated that where the liquid penetration time was higher (e. g. paracetamol-based formulations), the liquid distribution was poorer leading to retarded granule growth and <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration.</b> On the other hand where penetration time was lower (e. g. acetylsalicylic acid-based formulations), the growth was much faster but uniformity content problem arose because of the onset of crushing and layering phenomena...|$|E
40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> {{using an}} oil binder has been {{considered}} for the processing of fine coal {{many times in the}} past. However, the cost of the oil binder has always proven to be too high for commercial applications. This work revisited the technique of fine coal agglomeration in an effort to create an economically viable process and, thus, increase the overall utilisation of the coal resource. A novel and economic binder which consisted of a water-in-oil emulsion (95 vol% water and 5 vol% oil) was introduced. This emulsion was considered to be an economic alternative to pure oil as it had the potential to drastically reduce the amount of oil required in the process. A reduction was possible as the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion occupied the majority of the void space within the agglomerate; a space which would otherwise have to be filled with oil. In other words, the emulsion possessed an enhanced space-filling functionality. The use of oil as the continuous phase also meant that the necessary hydrophobic surface functionality of the binder was maintained. In this study the selectivity of the new emulsion binder was investigated and compared to the selectivity of a pure kerosene binder. The coal feed used in the study contained particles in the size range of 0 â 2 mm which also afforded the opportunity to study the ability of the emulsion to agglomerate and recover coal over a broad size range. It was found that the selectivity of the emulsion matched that of pure kerosene and consistently resulted in a low, < 15 (%ad), ash product. An analysis of the product agglomerates indicated that the emulsion could agglomerate particles up to 1 mm...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with improving this process of <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> using an immiscible binding liquid by maximising the functionality of the binder. In the past, research into the area of <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> has focussed {{on the use of}} only pure oils as binders. Pure oils are highly suitable, in a technical sense, as they are hydrophobic, immiscible with water and will preferentially wet hydrophobic particles in a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. However, pure oils are equally highly unsuitable due to their cost when combined with the dosages required in the agglomeration process. Therefore, to address this issue and thus reduce the costs associated with the organic binder, a high internal phase water-in-oil emulsion was introduced as the binder. This type of emulsion was selected as it possessed the hydrophobic surface functionality of oil while the space filling functionality of the binder was primarily satisfied by the dispersed water droplets within the emulsion. In other words, it was considered that by replacing the majority of the oil with water within the binder and subsequently the agglomerate structure, the overall organic liquid requirement would be substantially reduced. The solid feed material used throughout all of the work was a naturally occurring mixture of coal and mineral particles, coal being naturally hydrophobic and minerals such as clays, being generally hydrophilic. Initial experiments indicated that the emulsion could selectively agglomerate coal {{in the same manner as}} pure diesel. Moreover, by comparing the organic liquid dosage required to achieve agglomeration when using the emulsion with the dosage required when using pure diesel it was established that a 2 -fold reduction in the organic liquid requirement was achieved. A series of investigations was then carried out which examined the influence of the composition of the emulsion and process parameters on the performance of the emulsion. It was found that the initial result could be improved by reducing the level of degradation the emulsion experienced during the agglomeration process. The highlight of this work was the result for a 3 wt% aqueous NaCl-in-kerosene emulsion which achieved a 10 -fold reduction as compared to the benchmark diesel case. This emulsion achieved agglomeration in only 7 s and thus experienced the lowest level of degradation which resulted from mixing in the turbulent, aqueous environment of the agglomeration process. Moreover, it was shown that if the emulsion was pre-dispersed in water prior to the combination of the emulsion with the coal slurry the mixing time required to achieve agglomeration was only 3 s. Following on from the development of the emulsion binder, a fundamental investigation into binder functionality was carried out. It was found that the organic liquid requirement to achieve agglomeration was a function of the specific surface area of the material to be agglomerated and the voidage within the agglomerate material. Moreover, it appeared that the dispersed, water droplets within the emulsion played a space filling role within the void spaces, as hypothesised, however the thin film which formed around the particles comprised only of organic liquid and thus the water droplets did not play a space-filling role. That being said, the results indicated that the film formed when using the emulsion was 178 nm which was approximately 4 -times thinner than the film formed when using pure kerosene. Therefore, the results from this investigation indicated that the reduction which may be achieved is a function not only of the dispersed phase of the emulsion but also of the surface area of the feed. Due to the successful development of the agglomeration process using the emulsion a final investigation was carried out to study the potential application of this work in an industrial coal processing setting. It was found that the ash% and moisture content of the agglomerated product was sufficiently low to meet market requirements. In particular it was found that the emulsion binder consistently produced a product with an ash of 10 â 11 % leaving behind reject with an ash of 80 % from a feed with an ash of 61 %, providing that the emulsion dosage was sufficient. Overall, the work in this study has resulted in the development of a rapid agglomeration process with reduced organic reagent requirements. This work has provided a foundation for further and exciting work in this new area...|$|E
40|$|In {{batch tests}} with graphite, 2 min. were {{required}} to produce a maximum shift towards larger particle sizes in the distribution curves for a stirring speed of 21, 000 rpm, slurry concentration of 2 wt%, and oil dosage of 10 v/w%. For a stirring speed of 650 rpm, 4 min. were required for the maximum shift. When the oil was pre-emulsified and then added to the slurry, the maximum shift required 1 min. at 650 rpm. In all these cases, the distribution curves showed particle size reductions after their maximum shift. In the case of 650 rpm, the shift was {{all the way back}} to nearly the feed size distribution;For emulsion characterization, the nonpolar oils (tetralin and a heptane/heptanol mixture) were more stable than the polar oil (heptane) and an ultrasonic treatment produced the most turbid emulsions;In batch studies with Australian coal from the Ulan mine, emulsification decreased the time needed for agglomeration and created slightly more compact spherical agglomerates. Although the use of heptane (a nonpolar oil) created more <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> of the organic matter, its use caused the agglomeration to proceed at a slower rate. Of the three oils used, heptane, tetralin, and the heptane/heptanol combination, the mixture of heptane/heptanol produced the fastest agglomeration;In continuous runs employing Upper Freeport coal, there were runs where the size of the agglomerates was limited to about 1000 [mu]m or smaller. In these runs, application of the layering mechanism in the population balance did a good job in modelling the particle growth. For runs where agglomeration produced particles that were much larger than 1000 [mu]m, the layering model was able to fit the size distribution for small particle sizes, while a Gaussian distribution was able to fit the distribution for large particle sizes. The Gaussian distribution was useful for two purposes: (1) for determining the influence of the operating parameters on the particle size distribution data, and (2) to serve as an explicit functional form when employing a coalescence/breakage model. Thus, some of the continuous runs produced distributions that were explained by assuming growth by layering, while other continuous runs produced distributions that were explained by both layering (small particle sizes) and coalescence/breakage (large particle sizes) ...|$|E
40|$|Applications of {{conjugated}} polymer (CPs) in optoelectronic {{devices are}} critically depend on nature of thin film morphology. In thin film of CPs, {{the distribution of}} conjugation length is highly heterogeneous because of conformational defects, distortions of polymer chain and aggregates. A {{greater understanding of the}} self-assembly properties of polymer in solution, in particular control over aggregation leads to richer description of electronic properties and hence reproducible fabrication of thin film devices. Recently, chiral CPs have attracted profound interest because of their promising chiroptical properties in thin films and easy control over the <b>selective</b> <b>agglomeration</b> process. In this thesis, we have investigated the role of chiral side-chains on a series of thiophene diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) -benzodithiophene (BDT) based copolymers. Chiral 3, 7 -dimethyloctyl chain was introduced as an asymmetric chain to incorporate chirality on one of the repeating unit (TDPP) of copolymers. Two polymers with side-chains of identical chirality (S),(S) -PTDPP-BDT; (R),(R) -PTDPP-BDT and a third polymer with similar side-chains of opposite chirality (R),(S) -PTDPP-BDT were synthesized. The chiroptical properties were investigated by UV-visible and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Figure 1 : The structure of the TDPP-BDT copolymers. The copolymers dissolved in a good solvent (e. g. chloroform, chlorobenzene) in which polymers adopts random coil conformation, no chiral response has been observed. However, a critical addition of non-solvent (methanol), the copolymers stack in a chiral fashion and leads to typical bisignate Cotton effects. It is noteworthy that the two polymers, (S),(S) -PTDPP-BDT and (R),(R) -PTDPP-BDT exhibiting a nearly ideal mirror-image relationship in CD spectra (Figure 2 a) whereas the (R),(S) -PTDPP-BDT lacks chiropticity even with the addition of methanol. The aggregation induced CD phenomena are dependent on the temperature of solution and do not exhibit reversibility in a heating-cooling cycle. Figure 2 : (a) The mirror image Cotton effects of (S),(S) -PTDPP-BDT and (R),(R) -PTDPP-BDT (b) No CD signal was observed for the (R),(S) -PTDPP-BDT polymer. Figure 3 : The variation of (a) UV-vis and (b) CD spectra of (R),(R) -PTDPP-BDT polymer with thickness of the solid film. To investigate the role of thickness and annealing temperature on optical and chiroptical properties of polymer films, thin films were prepared using drop-casting method from a solution of chlorobenzene. Both the polymer showed gradual enhancement of CD signal with the increase of film thickness but we did not see any such order with temperature (Figure 3). Figure 4 : The morphology observed for the film by (a) AFM; (b); (c) FESEM. The thin film morphology of polymers is characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Figure 4). AFM studies show the polymer molecules self-assembled and formed interconnected nanofibers. Whereas FESEM images clearly revealed that, the nanofibers of polymers are predominantly stack in a chiral fashion and mimic a one-handed helix which leads to bisignate Cotton effects. The (S),(S) -PTDPP-BDT and (R),(R) -PTDPP-BDT form fibers with opposite handedness whereas (R),(S) -PTDPP-BDT do not have such preferred handedness. The research described in this thesis aims to explore the role of chiral side-chains to impose chiral stacking and hence resulting chiral expression. Chirality in this class of polymers may endows them promising optoelectronic properties. (For figures pl see the abstract pdf file...|$|E
