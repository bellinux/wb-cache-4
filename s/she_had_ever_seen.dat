5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

25|$|She {{was signed}} {{up by the}} American {{producer}} Henry Miller and made her Broadway debut in New York City in 1906 to critical and popular success. Her English-language premiere in November 1906 was {{in the title role}} of Hedda Gabler. She quickly became extremely popular (a theater was named after her) and remained a major Broadway star for years, often acting in the plays of Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov. Dorothy Parker described her as the finest Hedda Gabler <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Clarissa studied art in Paris. Her {{mother had}} asked the British Ambassador, Sir George Clerk, to keep a watchful eye on her, an {{unintended}} consequence of this being that she was taken under the wing of an Embassy press secretary who, with his wife, introduced her to a round of café society parties. Among the friends she made in Paris were the monocled Fitzroy Maclean, a future politician and adventurer who was then third secretary at the embassy, and the writer Marthe Bibesco. Together with two female contemporaries, she made {{a visit to the}} Folies Bergère, an unusual destination for sixteen-year-old girls, where the singer Josephine Baker, clad only in a circlet of bananas, became the first naked female body <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Williams's first tournament of the 2013 {{season was}} in Brisbane, where {{she won the}} title without {{dropping}} a set. Williams was upset in {{the quarterfinals of the}} 2013 Australian Open by fellow American player Sloane Stephens. By virtue of defeating Petra Kvitová in Doha, Williams returned to the world No. 1 position for the sixth time in her career and became the oldest woman in the Open Era to hold the ranking. Williams went on to lose to Victoria Azarenka in the final. In the Miami final, Williams lost a set to Maria Sharapova {{for the first time since}} 2008. However, this setback did not stop Williams who recorded her seventieth come-from-behind win. The win made Williams a six-time champion in Miami breaking the record she held with Steffi Graf and became only the fourth woman in the open era to have won a tournament at least six times. Williams successfully defended her Charleston title, winning it for the third time overall. Williams won her fiftieth career singles title in Madrid, defeating Sharapova in the final. Williams then played Rome, where she won the title without dropping a set, defeating Victoria Azarenka in the final to take her second title. Williams only dropped ten games in reaching the quarterfinals at Roland Garros. There, she played Svetlana Kuznetsova and lost her first set of the tournament. In the semi final Williams only lost one game when she defeated Sara Errani, something seven-time French Open champion Chris Evert described as the finest female performance on clay <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> Williams defeated Sharapova to claim her second Roland Garros title, her sixteenth grand slam tournament title overall. She became the fourth woman in the Open era after Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf to win each Grand Slam tournament title on at least two occasions. At the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, she advanced easily to the fourth round before being upset by eventual finalist Sabine Lisicki in three sets. After Wimbledon, Williams won the Swedish Open by defeating Johanna Larsson in the final, the tournament win marked the first occasion that she had won an International level title. By winning the tournament this meant that Williams had managed to be undefeated on clay during the season.|$|E

500|$|Hügel-Marshall became {{active in}} the women's rights {{movement}} while in Frankfurt. But even among her feminist activist colleagues she felt isolated, {{because she was the}} only black woman there. She had never met another black German, and from her years in the children's home she had learned to think of blacks (including herself) as inferior and immoral. Years later she commented that [...] "the most disastrous thing I learned at the home was self-hatred." [...] In 1986, she attended a meeting of Afro-Germans; she was 39 years old {{and it was the first}} time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> [...] "a black face that wasn't my own." [...] She was empowered by the sense of community and became an activist for Afro-Germans, studying their history and asserting their legitimacy in a society that still assumed that all Germans must be white.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, Ernst {{said he had}} {{difficulty}} persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child [...] "whimpering under a sofa, full of despair." [...] He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me," [...] Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again." [...] However, despite Elisabeth's sad eyes, she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Fillmore went abroad, stating {{publicly}} {{that as he}} lacked office, {{he might as well}} travel. [...] The trip was at the advice of political friends, who felt that by touring, he would avoid involvement in the contentious issues of the day, and he spent over a year, from March 1855 to June 1856, in Europe and the Middle East. Queen Victoria is said to have pronounced the ex-president the handsomest man <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> while his presence in the gallery of the House of Commons {{at the same time as}} Van Buren excited a comment from MP John Bright. Fillmore was offered an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the [...] "literary nor scientific attainment" [...] to justify the degree. He is also quoted as having explained that he [...] "lacked the benefit of a classical education" [...] and could not, therefore, understand the Latin text of the diploma, adding that he believed [...] "no man should accept a degree he cannot read." [...] Another possibility is that Fillmore refused the degree to escape the heckling and taunting to which Oxford students typically subjected the recipients of such honors.|$|E

500|$|In the {{epilogue}} set 20 years later, Katniss and Peeta {{have two}} children.

Katniss dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in both the Games and the war. When she feels distressed, Katniss plays a comforting but repetitive game: reminding herself of every good thing <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> someone do.

500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she meant to say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E

50|$|Described by Freya as {{the most}} {{powerful}} witch <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> Dahlia first gained her enhanced powers by linking her magic to the magic possessed by her then five-year-old niece Freya.

2500|$|By 1925 Nazimova {{could no}} longer afford to invest in more films; and {{financial}} backers withdrew their support. Left with few options, she gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in Rouben Mamoulian's 1930 New York production of Turgenev's A Month in the Country and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, which the critic Pauline Kael [...] later described as the greatest performance <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> on the American stage. In the early 1940s, she appeared in a few more films, playing Robert Taylor's mother in Escape (1940) and Tyrone Power's mother in Blood and Sand (1941). This late return to motion pictures fortunately preserves Nazimova and her art on sound film.|$|E

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{were again}} without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, {{a friend of the}} band, {{suggested}} Chad Smith, claiming he was the best drummer <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> The band agreed to audition Smith, but he was late and the last drummer to audition. Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking down the street with a really bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis was not about to argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E
