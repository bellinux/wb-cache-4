60|$|He {{held the}} {{envelope}} in his hand, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> postmark between his horny thumbnails.|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded. He {{got to his}} feet, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shoes, {{and walked}} slowly toward the door, where he turned.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} {{her chin}} thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're rather nice. Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bill Brasky <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gang in the skit, Holiday Inn ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled at}} his choking collar, {{looked at his}} watch, opened <b>the</b> window to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> street, looked <b>at</b> his watch, tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.|$|R
50|$|Things get instense between Ramsey Nijem and Juilian Lane {{during their}} <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> weight-in. So {{much so that}} the {{assistant}} coaches from each team, Justin Buchholz and Duane Ludwig get into an argument over their respective gyms and how Duane believes he's the one who turned T.J. into a champion. They, along with Cody and T.J. have to be separated.|$|R
6000|$|Again Holmes {{flattened}} out {{the paper}} upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> curious inscription, which ran as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|Kells <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gold. His jaw worked convulsively. He had {{the eyes}} of a trapped wolf. Yet he seemed not wholly to {{comprehend}} what had happened to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} we'll ever see him again." [...] Gross <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{indicator}} dot, still hanging {{at the edge}} of the board. [...] "I wonder if he'll ever move back this way." ...|$|E
40|$|As Hafez al Assad <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rapidly deteriorating {{situation}} in Syria from that {{special place in}} heaven for Syrian dictators, surely the thought that a Libyan styled intervention happening in Syria would have crossed his mind. As much as it would make him turn in his grave, {{there is very little}} moral credit these days to staunchly deny that an imminent or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very least a likely intervention is just around the corner...|$|R
50|$|Enraged, Gerardo {{attempts}} to throw Miranda from the cliff, only {{to realize he}} cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down {{with his wife and}} sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards <b>the</b> balcony <b>at</b> <b>the</b> now off-screen Miranda.|$|R
60|$|All on the Mary Turner, {{fore and}} aft, lined {{the rail and}} <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> apprehensively <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{leviathan}} that was {{as long as the}} schooner.|$|R
6000|$|Thurston's tone carried {{conviction}} with it, but Savine cut him short. [...] "It is {{the practical}} aspect {{that appeals to}} me," [...] he said. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river for several minutes before he asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down? ...|$|E
6000|$|They all <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sample case. It {{seemed to}} be an {{ordinary}} leather case, with a metal handle and a snap lock. [...] "I'm getting curious," [...] Thacher said. [...] "What's in there? You're all so tense. Diamonds? Stolen jewels?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I WON'T answer it," [...] she cried. [...] "Why should I?" [...] And {{she looked}} away into the restless hive of the theatre. She spoke so wildly that she {{attracted}} attention. But it half pleased her. She <b>stared</b> abstractedly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pit.|$|R
50|$|Bruenor is {{fighting}} a terrible battle with Grguch which {{ends with a}} disemboweled and headless Grguch. A battered Bruenor and dying Regis are brought before Obould. As Obould <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Bruenor, <b>the</b> Shaman messenger meant for the parlay heals Regis at Obould's command. Obould lowers his weapon and seemingly agrees to a parlay with Mithral Hall and the North. Hralien allows Tos'un {{to live in the}} Moonwood and the group returns home.|$|R
50|$|Gonzalo's family {{witnesses}} the CIA-backed {{military coup}} of 1973, where Salvador Allende commits suicide and Augusto Pinochet takes over. After Father McEnroe {{is removed from}} the now militarized school, he visits the worship performed by a new priest, consumes the sacramental bread to save it from desecration and declares the ground to be desecrated. Machuca leads the other students in honoring the priest and is expelled. Gonzalo tries to visit the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live but arrives to find it being destroyed by the soldiers. He then witnesses a soldier murdering Silvana. Himself being dragged into the conflict, Gonzalo convinces a soldier that he is not from the shantytown due to his nice clothing and fair complexion, and is forced to abandon his friend. He returns to his family's new home, which is now even more opulent thanks to his mother's lover and the new redistribution of wealth under the new government. He remains distraught over the events he has witnessed as he remembers his friends as he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ruins of their homes. The 17 years of Chilean dictatorship, in which 250,000 Chileans were detained, have begun.|$|R
6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor, {{then out}} the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't even tell you that, sir," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Sir Robert {{tugged at}} his red beard and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor. Presently {{he lifted his head}} and I saw that his face was troubled, the face of a man, indeed, who is {{struggling}} with himself, or, as I thought, with his pride.|$|E
60|$|Raut {{gripped the}} {{hand-rail}} tightly, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cone. The heat was intense. The boiling {{of the iron}} and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had to be gone through now. Perhaps, after all...|$|E
5000|$|On June 16, 2015, WWE 2K16 {{was officially}} {{announced}} by WWE and 2K, when they revealed {{the first six}} superstars and divas, who would be included on the game's roster. On July 6, 2015, [...] "Stone Cold" [...] Steve Austin was announced as the cover superstar for this year's game, accompanying by the debut trailer, which features Austin digging up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> desert, uncovering his customized [...] "Smoking Skull" [...] championship belt and putting it over his shoulder, before turning his head, just to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera.|$|R
60|$|The {{powerful}} {{grasp on}} the panther's throat {{was on the}} point of relaxing; the brute was digging its claws in the shoulders of the fallen man, and he, feeling faint with loss of blood, looked upon death as it <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him from <b>the</b> beast's golden eyes, and all that he was conscious of was the feeling that death was good.|$|R
60|$|So she ended, and {{listening}} to her, I felt the tears rising in my eyes, {{because she was so}} much alone, and I feared that this god of hers would never come to save her from the torments of the priests. Seti also turned his head away, and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky over the open court where the lights of dawn were gathering.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Tytherleigh rested {{an elbow}} on the table, and {{thrusting}} {{his fingers through}} his hair, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> note-book in which he had been writing down her answers. [...] "How strange--how very strange!" [...] he remarked. Presently he added, [...] "We must find out where you were baptised, Miss Affleck; you do not know, I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Dick ground {{his heels}} into the turf and laid his weight against the bow. While all men watched breathless, he drew {{it to an}} arc, he drew it till the string was level with his ear. He loosed, then, slewing round, {{straightened}} himself and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> earth. As he said afterward, he feared to watch that arrow.|$|E
60|$|As for Stephen, {{he stood}} high in his {{stirrups}} and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl. She was standing {{full in the}} light,--her lashes fallen, her face crimson. But no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she, nor did he wonder at her gown of a gone-by century. Her words came first, and they were low. She did not address him by name.|$|E
50|$|Braun Strowman {{called out}} Roman Reigns, stating that Reigns got lucky. Instead of Reigns, The Undertaker came out. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> Strowman left the ring. As Undertaker {{was about to}} leave, Reigns came out. Reigns confronted Undertaker, and said that Strowman had called him out, not the deadman, before declaring the ring as his yard now. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> both looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> WrestleMania sign and Undertaker chokeslammed Reigns. A match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania was made {{official}} the following week. Reigns and Strowman had their Fastlane rematch on the March 20 episode, but were interrupted by The Undertaker, who chokeslammed Strowman, and Reigns hit a spear on Undertaker. Strowman was then confirmed for the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} in tweeds turned to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, surprised.|$|R
60|$|Renouard, {{his hand}} {{grasping}} {{the back of}} a chair, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him dumbly.|$|R
6000|$|Ezra Girdlestone {{remained}} behind, stretching {{his legs}} In {{front of the}} empty grate. [...] "The governor is a hard nail," [...] he soliloquized, as he <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shining steel bars. [...] "Depend upon it, though, he feels this more than he shows. Why, it's the only friend he ever had in the world--or ever will have, in all probability. However, it's no business of mine," [...] with which comforting reflection he began to whistle as he turned over {{the pages of the}} private day-book of the firm.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} the open sea, his arms crossed, with a {{reflective}} fierceness. His very appearance made him utterly different from everyone on board that vessel. The grey shirt, the blue sash, one rolled-up sleeve baring a sculptural forearm, the negligent masterfulness of his tone and pose were very distasteful to Mr. Travers, who, having {{made up his mind}} to wait for some kind of official assistance, regarded the intrusion of that inexplicable man with suspicion. From the moment Lingard came on board the yacht, every eye in that vessel had been fixed upon him. Only Carter, within earshot and leaning with his elbow upon the rail, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> deck as if overcome with drowsiness or lost in thought.|$|E
60|$|Sharkey <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hand {{which had}} fondled him. It {{was of a}} strange dead pallor, with a yellow shiny web betwixt the fingers. All over it was a white fluffy dust, like the flour of a new-baked loaf. It lay thick on Sharkey's neck and cheek. With a cry he flung the woman from his lap; but in an instant, with a wild-cat bound, and a scream of triumphant malice, she had sprung at the surgeon, who {{vanished}} yelling under the table. One of her clawing hands grasped Galloway by the beard, but he tore himself away, and snatching a pike, held her off from him as she gibbered and mowed with the blazing eyes of a maniac.|$|E
60|$|The other {{continued}} still unruffled, {{and staring}} {{over the edge}} idly as an angler <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a stream.|$|R
6000|$|... [Then, motionless, he <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his brother's open, [...] sightless eyes. Suddenly he wets {{his finger}} and holds it to the [...] girl's lips, then to LARRY'S.] ...|$|R
60|$|She did not move, {{save the}} convulsive motion of {{her breath and}} the nervous action of her fingers. She <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{a spot in the}} carpet; she couldn't face him.|$|R
