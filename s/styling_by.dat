25|$|In September 1963, Nissan {{brought the}} Bluebird {{up-to-date}} with boxier <b>styling</b> (<b>by</b> Pininfarina), resembling European designs, particularly the Lancia Fulvia. The 410 was built from 1964 to 1967. The appearance {{appears to have}} had an influence on Nissan's first V8-powered Nissan President in 1965, and the Nissan Sunny in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian bagpiping is {{characterized}} in its <b>styling</b> <b>by</b> hiccupping, use of high notes to articulate lower notes, creating a characteristic rhythmic squeaking while the instrument is played. This playing style greatly influenced certain genres of fiddle music in Hungary, and also characterized early church organ music in Hungary: {{prior to the}} introduction of organs, the duda had been used to accompany hymnody in churches.|$|E

25|$|The Routemaster was {{developed}} between 1947 and 1956 {{by a team}} directed by AAM Durrant and Colin Curtis, with vehicle <b>styling</b> <b>by</b> Douglas Scott. The design brief was to produce a vehicle that was lighter (hence more fuel-efficient), easier to operate {{and that could be}} maintained by the existing maintenance practices at the recently opened Aldenham Works, but with easier and lower-cost servicing procedures. The resulting vehicle seated 64 passengers, despite being three-quarters of a ton lighter than buses in the RT family, which seated 56.|$|E

500|$|Nation of Ulysses' {{music was}} noisy and manic, {{but they also}} had a strong free-jazz influence. The group {{embodied}} {{a rejection of the}} 1960s and 1970s music and <b>styling</b> <b>by</b> rejecting drug use and advocating that punk youth dress nicely and sensibly. To this end, the liner notes of 13-Point Program to Destroy America states the band's aim [...] "To dress well, as clothing and fashion, are the only things which we -- the kids -- being utterly disenfranchised, have any control over." [...] Much of the band admitted to not knowing how to play their instruments well, stating [...] "All you need is a concept. There's no reason you have to sound like Led Zeppelin." ...|$|E

2500|$|The power car, 9908 Silver Charger, was unique. It {{utilised}} {{a single}} new EMC 567 V-12 engine developing 1,000hp, {{rather than the}} pair used in the contemporary EMC E3. It had one Martin Blomberg-designed E-unit A1A passenger truck at the front, with powered outer axles and a center idler axle, and an unpowered trailing truck, giving it the unusual wheel arrangement of A1A-2. This made it mechanically half of an E3. The back half of the power car was a baggage area. [...] This made it similar to special power-baggage units built by EMD for the Colorado Springs section of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific [...] "Rocky Mountain Rocket", though the latter had a carbody and E-3/E-6 <b>styling</b> <b>by</b> EMD. [...] The [...] "Silver Charger" [...] was the last power unit built by Budd with the unique [...] "Zephyr"/"Flying Yankee" [...] shovelnose styling.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986–88, 100 second {{generation}} (Type 7) LRVs were delivered from the Japanese firm Kinki Sharyo, {{with an additional}} 20 cars ordered and delivered in 1997. The first low-floor Green Line streetcars, allowing for handicapped-accessible boarding directly from slightly raised platforms, were the Type 8 cars from AnsaldoBreda which began arriving in 1998. The first Type 8s entered revenue service in March 1999, but they were prone to derailment at higher speeds as well as brake problems; not until 2008 did they assume full service on the [...] "D" [...] Branch (where they reach full speed). One hundred low-floor cars were purchased from the Italian company AnsaldoBreda, with <b>styling</b> <b>by</b> Pininfarina. They were initially problematic and difficult to maintain: the first cars failed every 400miles (640km), {{far less than the}} 9,000miles (14,500km) specified by the MBTA, and were prone to derailments. The MBTA has been forced to spend an additional US$9.5 million to modify tracks to prevent the derailments, echoing early problems with the Boeing stock. The MBTA has been criticized for their failure to assess Bredas' reliability before entering into the deal, and during delivery.|$|E
