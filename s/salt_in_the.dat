5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) {{is located}} in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an {{administrative}} subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest and oldest salt mine and the world's second largest. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diet.|$|E

The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
5|$|During the preceramic era, {{the people}} of the {{highlands}} produced petrographs and petroglyphs representing their deities, the abundant flora and fauna of the area, abstract motives and anthropomorphic or anthropo-zoomorphic elements. The self-sufficient sedentary agricultural society developed into a culture based on ceramics and the extraction of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Herrera Period, usually defined as 800 BC to 800 AD. During this time, the oldest existing form of constructed art was erected; the archaeoastronomical site called El Infiernito ("The Little Hell") by the catholic Spanish conquistadors. The Herrera Period also marked the widespread use of pottery and textiles and the start of what would become the main motive for the Spanish conquest; the skilled fine goldworking. The golden age of Muisca metallurgy is represented in the Muisca raft, considered the masterpiece of this technology and depicts the initiation ritual of the new zipa of Bacatá, {{the southern part of the}} Muisca Confederation. This ceremony, performed by xeques (priests) and caciques wearing feathered golden crowns and accompanied by music and dance, took place on a raft in Lake Guatavita, in the northern part of the flat Bogotá savanna. Accounts of such ceremonies created the legend of El Dorado among the Spanish, leading them on a decade-long quest for this mythical place.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is based on}} the nano-or ultrafiltration of inorganic <b>salts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a polyelectrolyte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feed solution. Cellulose acetate membranes are selected with a pore size of 10 – 20 nm. The membranes are imaged using atomic force microscope. The membrane is completely impermeable to the polyelectrolyte. Polyelectrolyte concentrations are taken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 0. 5 – 1 g/l to avoid a gel layer formation over the membrane. It is discovered that, at such low polyelectrolyte concentration, inorganic <b>salt</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeate is higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feed solution. This process therefore deviates from conventional membrane separation processes, where the permeate salt concentration is lower or equal to <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feed solution. It is shown that during the nano-or ultrafiltration of inorganic <b>salts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of polyelectrolyte, the ratio of <b>salt</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeate to feed increases when <b>the</b> initial <b>salt</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feed solution is low.

25|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample {{is a factor}} {{that needs to be}} considered when preparing a MALDI sample as well. Salts can aid a MALDI spectra by preventing aggregation or precipitation while stabilizing the sample. However, interfering signals can be observed due to side reactions of the matrix with the sample, such {{as in the case of}} the matrix interacting with alkali metal ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra. Typically the amount of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix only becomes a problem in very high concentrations, such as 1 molar. The problem of having too high a {{concentration of}} <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample can be solved by first running the solution through liquid chromatography to help purify the sample, but this method is time consuming and results in the loss of some of the sample to be analyzed. Another method is focused on purification once the sample solution is deposited onto the sample probe. Many sample probes can be designed to have a membrane on the surface that can selectively bind the sample in question to the probe surface. The surface can then be rinsed off to remove all unnecessary salts or background molecules. The matrix of appropriate salt concentration can then be deposited directly onto the sample on the probe surface and crystallized there. Despite these negative effects of salt concentration, a separate desalting step is usually not necessary in the case of proteins, because the selection of appropriate buffer salts prevents the occurrence of this problem.|$|E
