40|$|ABSTRACT: Biosolids {{have been}} {{reported}} to increase yields and supply plant nutrients. However, complying with health and environmental standards is necessary before applying biosolids to land. Thus, <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilization</b> is required to make biosolids safe enough for their agricultural use. Side effects of stabilization processes on agronomic features of sewage sludge are not quite known, although their understanding is essential for biosolids management. Based on a model equivalent to the Mitscherlich equation, effects of the most common processes for <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilization</b> were evaluated (composting, liming, heat-drying and solar irradiation) in relation to the agronomic effectiveness of biosolids to yield Lolium perenne L. on two tropical soils, with NH 4 H 2 PO 4 as a reference. Sewage stabilization processes have affected the ability of biosolids to promote plant growth. Their effectiveness was usually higher than fertilizer in a Spodosol and lower in an Oxisol. Solar-irradiated sludge presented the highest effectiveness among the biosolids and reached peak yields at the lowest application rate independent on soil type. Biosolids could efficiently substitute fertilizers and even yield more plant dry matter than the NH 4 H 2 PO 4 reference, depending on the biosolid and soil type...|$|E

In this study the use of sludge from cardboard mill as stabilizing agent in the stabilization treatment of cadmium polluted sediment was examined. The effectiveness of treatment and long-term leaching behavior of cadmium was evaluated by determining the cumulative percentage of cadmium leached, diffusion coeffi cients (De) and by applying different leaching tests (semi-dynamic test, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, waste extraction test). In order to simulate the “worst case ” leaching conditions, the semi-dynamic leaching test was modifi ed using 0. 014 M acetic acid (pH = 3. 25) and humic acids solution (20 mg l- 1 TOC) as leachants instead of deionized water. A diffusion-based model was used to elucidate the controlling leaching mechanisms. Applied treatment was effective in immobilizing cadmium irrespective of high availability in the untreated sample.

With reference to a WWTP with a capacity of more than 2 million equivalent inhabitants that generates an average daily flow of 6, 000 m 3 primary and secondary sludge (at a total solid, TS, content of about 1 %), two solutions aimed at improving the performances of the AD process were evaluated considering technical and economical aspects. The possible first solution planned the thickening of secondary sludge, with the aim of searching for the optimal TS content able to guarantee the thermal sustainability of the AD process. TS content ranging from 3. 5 % to 8 % was considered in the calculations.

Higher TS values for secondary sludge, although enhancing the production of thermal energy, are not recommended because of the worsening of their rheological behaviour.

Nevertheless, methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is often restricted by the poor biochemical methane potential and slow hydrolysis rate of WAS. This work systematically investigated the effect of PHA levels of WAS on anaerobic methane production, using both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches. Biochemical methane potential tests showed that methane production increased with increased PHA levels in WAS. Model-based analysis suggested that the PHA-based method enhanced methane production by improving biochemical methane potential of WAS, with the highest enhancement being around 40 % (from 192 to 274 [*]L CH 4 /kg VS added; VS: volatile solid) when the PHA levels increased from 21 to 143 [*]mg/g VS. In contrast, the hydrolysis rate (approximately 0. 10 d− 1) was not significantly affected by the PHA levels.

40|$|The paper investigates {{and compares}} the {{characteristics}} of sludges produced by membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR) and Conventional Activated Sludge (CAS) systems. Stability and dewaterability of full-scale MBR and CAS treatment plants are measured and compared. Obtained results show that specific methane production is higher in CAS sludge compared to MBR sludge because of the higher solid retention time of the MBR. Nonetheless MBR sludge results to be characterized by a non-negligible biometanation potential (BMP). Methane production measured during BMP tests is around 250 NmL/gVS for MBR sludge, equaling 2 / 3 of methane production obtained, in similar condition, for CAS sludge. Dewaterability is evaluated by Specific Resistance to Filtration (SRF), Capillary Suction Time (CST) and Time To Filter (TTF) tests. Data obtained {{before and after the}} anaerobic digestion of the sludges show that the stabilization process affects much more the resistance to filtration of CAS sludge than the resistance to filtration of MBR sludge. The same trend is observed, for the other measured parameters.

40|$|Several factors {{depending}} on the sludge, the soil, or the combination of both substrates, may affect element availability to plants. In this study, an assessment was done {{of the effect of}} two sludges obtained by different processes (activated <b>sludge</b> and facultative <b>stabilization</b> pond) on heavy-metal availability and uptake by sorghum plants in soils with high and low copper contents. Results obtained for DTPA-extractable metal indicated higher metal availability in sludge-amended soils. In addition, sludges caused changes in copper and zinc distribution in soil, indicating in most cases a discrete increase in the more labile metal forms. However, observed changes did not increase heavy metal concentration in plant leaves, indicating that assessment of metal availability by a chemical procedure (single extraction or metal fractionation) would not permit a good prediction of metal bioavailability. On the other hand, sludge application at a rate of 100 t ha(- 1) to high-copper agricultural soils would not imply greater mobility of this metal on account of a greater sorbing capacity provided by the sludges. Such results would indicate that sludges from wastewater treatment plants, meeting the standards of heavy metal contents, regardless of the process by which they were obtained, may be applied to several kinds of soil, even to high-copper soils, with no risk of increasing heavy metal bioavailability to phytotoxic levels in the short range...|$|R
