40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between student perceptions of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support,</b> self-efficacy for reading, and reading achievement for African American and European American students. Previous studies of teacher support have emphasized emotional support and have found considerable evidence for positive effects on motivation and achievement (Wentzel, 2009). Over time, <b>support</b> for <b>competence</b> has increasingly emerged as a distinct dimension of teacher support (Beghetto, 2007; Wentzel et al., 2010) and there is a need for the extension of this empirical research on the association between teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support,</b> motivation, and achievement. This study seeks to narrow this focus to student perceptions of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support,</b> student self-efficacy, and reading achievement in middle school. The study sample consisted of 366 seventh- grade students in an ethnically and economically diverse school district. Students completed measures of their perceptions of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support,</b> which included encouragement and instrumental help in reading. Students also completed a reading self-efficacy questionnaire and an assessment of information text comprehension. While controlling for socioeconomic status, hierarchical multiple regressions and MANOVA were conducted. African American students perceived statistically significantly higher levels of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support</b> for reading compared to their European American peers. European American students performed at a higher level on the reading achievement measure, and there was no significant difference between groups in self-efficacy. Teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support</b> was significantly associated with self-efficacy regardless of ethnicity, and was also significantly associated with reading achievement, but only for African American students. Self-efficacy was significantly correlated with reading achievement for both ethnic groups; however, this correlation was statistically significantly higher for European American students. Post hoc analyses revealed that the correlation between self-efficacy and reading achievement was significant for European American students regardless of perceived level of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support,</b> and the self-efficacy and reading achievement relationship was significant for African American students only if they perceived high levels of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>support...</b>|$|R

Data were collected by telephone and face-to-face interviews. Within the NHS and HEI's the specified framework documents have a variable penetration. Documents are used to support CPD at the individual and organisational levels. They also inform, albeit in a very limited way, curricular developments in HEIs. The success of framework documents is linked to their timeliness in relation to local and national developments such as service redesign and to whether or not documents were `championed' by committed practitioners or professional groups. Competency framework documents are recognised and utilised by clinicians, NHS managers and Education providers. Information providers and users need to co-ordinate their initiatives in order that staff development links with service redesign. <br/...|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} case-based study {{investigates the}} development of project management (PM) as an organisational capability in two public sector organisations (PSO) {{during a period of}} rapid environmental change. Within the PM literature, the concept of project management capability (PMC) and how it develops over time through organizational learning is still an emerging tradition led to date by mainly European scholars (Lindkvist, Söderlund, Davies, Brady, Hobday, etc.). This investigation locates itself within this emerging tradition and represents a unique empirical opportunity to study the learning processes involved in PMC development in a complex setting that shows these processes in greater relief. In both of the organizations studied, the elevation and enhancement of PMC from a relatively low-level activity to a strategic <b>supporting</b> <b>competence</b> was triggered by radical and rapid change in the external environment during the 2000 s. The main process insight is that PMC is found to be developed as a dynamic organisational capability in complex PM settings through organisational complex problem-solving (CPS). The overall outcomes of the study build upon and extend the emerging PMC literature in at least three important respects, with implications for traditional PM research and practice. Firstly, in contrast to the mechanistic view of traditional PM, this study supports an integrated knowledge-based view of ‘projects as process’ and ‘PM as practice’. In this view, a project is seen to be ‘a mode of organising to accomplish a temporary undertaking’ and PMC is seen as a strategic organisational practice in organising complex projects. Secondly, PMC is honed as a practice through goal-directed organisational CPS. This builds upon and extends the work of Popper on the evolutionary growth of knowledge by revealing problemsolving as a two-stage process of differentiation-integration, or disorder-order. In contrast to traditional PM which follows a path from ‘order to order’, {{the development of}} PMC as an organisational capability is found to proceed from ‘order to disorder to order’. Thirdly, using the lens of PM as practice, a 2 ̆ 7 distributed organising 2 ̆ 7 approach is suggested for coordinating the formation of ‘complex knowledge’ under organisational CPS, which is inherently emergent and dynamic. This contrasts with the ‘centralised planning’ approach of traditional PM, which assumes that knowledge is manifest in pre-given plans that are executed with little organisational learning expected beyond the application of prior knowledge...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBeginning in the {{elementary}} school years, there are differences among children on how they perceive their competence in physical activity (PA). Children's competence perceptions may influence their affective reactions to PA. A crucial question is how to motivate children who hold low competence perceptions to enhance their enjoyment and PA involvement. Because parents play critical roles in children's development and socialization, social support from parents can be an important factor to complement teachers' effort to enhance children's enjoyment and PA involvement. In this research we identified the associations among children's beliefs about parental social <b>support,</b> perceived <b>competence</b> and enjoyment in school PA. MethodsThree hundred and twenty children (9 – 11 years old) participated in a two-wave study. At the first wave, children completed questionnaires measuring their beliefs about parental social <b>support,</b> perceived <b>competence</b> and enjoyment in school PA; they reported their enjoyment again 8 months later at the second wave. ResultsBoth concurrent and longitudinal analyses revealed that beliefs about parental social support were important factors associated with children's enjoyment in school PA, especially among girls with low competence perceptions. ConclusionFamily socialization factors should be taken into consideration. The efficacy of individual and community-level strategies should be included and evaluated when designing effective intervention strategies that enhance children's PA in school.
