40|$|Projeto Axé is a {{non-governmental}} organization that carries out political-pedagogical work and art education {{for children and}} adolescents living in a street situation in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. I conducted an exploratory ethnographic study with Projeto Axé 2 ̆ 7 s Street Education program in order to observe its day-to-day activities and to conduct a utilization-focused program evaluation (Patton 1997) of its pedagogical praxis. This thesis will describe how ethnographic fieldwork methods are interwoven with the political-pedagogical approaches of Projeto Axé 2 ̆ 7 s Street Education program and explain how <b>street</b> <b>educators</b> attempt to construct citizenship with participants in the Street Education program. Findings are based on an analysis of data collected during three months of fieldwork, during which I observed the day-to-day activities of the Street Education program and formally interviewed seven <b>street</b> <b>educators.</b> Projeto Axé 2 ̆ 7 s <b>street</b> <b>educators</b> employ ethnographic fieldwork methods in order to more holistically understand the everyday lives of street youth, {{as well as the}} dynamics of 2 ̆ 2 street culture 2 ̆ 2 that emerge in the particular urban spaces frequented by street youth. The result is an anthropological understanding that serves as the foundation for street education activities, through which street youth are provoked to think critically about their everyday reality in order to transform it (Freire 1970). The construction of citizenship through Street Education is based on the 2 ̆ 2 pedagogy of desire 2 ̆ 2 (Carvalho 2000), a psychological-sociocultural theory of learning developed by the organization specifically for working with youth living in a street situation. Street education and the construction of citizenship begin and happen with the desire of street youth. The content of street education is not fixed or predetermined, but emerges out of a particular street youth 2 ̆ 7 s desires, needs, and dialogues with <b>street</b> <b>educators.</b> I conclude that, combined with Freireian-inspired political pedagogy and the pedagogy of desire, the use of ethnographic fieldwork methods by <b>street</b> <b>educators</b> is crucial for Projeto Axé 2 ̆ 7 s attempts at realizing radical transformations in the lives of street youth. Furthermore, Projeto Axé 2 ̆ 7 s anthropological approaches to the social and political inclusion of street youth increase the adaptability of its street pedagogy to the local socio-cultural realities emergent in other urban spaces...|$|R

50|$|By helping street {{children}} in their everyday difficulties, these organizations help children provide for themselves. For example, <b>street</b> <b>educators</b> throughout Latin America have helped {{street children}} form working relationships with market traders—instead of tossing and further damaging unwanted fruit, market traders give slightly damaged and overripe fruit to street children to eat or sell. In Asunción, Paraguay, outreach workers identified that many street children were suffocating when they built fires in cisterns and then trapped themselves in the space. Outreach organizations educated street children on how to safely handle and build fires, and also were advocates for street children who died trying to survive. Some criticize outreach programs because they, like rehabilitation programs, do not fix the issue of street children. Proponents of outreach programs claim that their practices are built on the ideology that street children are unfortunate effects of societal deficiencies, and therefore {{the only way to}} effectively assist street children is through empowerment and applicable assistance.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the tasks}} of education, in its social dimension, is to make {{possible}} {{the construction of a}} better society. In this perspective, education aims at finding ways to promote individuals who, for various motives, are at the margin of society, closed in their own world and denying social life. The discomfort of these individuals may led them to be confronted to bad situations, like deviancies, drug abuse, alcoholism, etc. Social education have proposals which show ways for integration into society on the base of a new analysis of communitary education. The building of the community, on the base of some assertions from Martin Buber’s philosophy, following some steps, especially about the understanding of the “small words” dynamics which are part of daily life and open perspective of integration.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} premiere of Sesame <b>Street,</b> producers, <b>educators,</b> and {{officials}} of other nations began requesting that {{a version of the}} series be broadcast in their countries. CBS executive Michael Dann was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called [...] "rural purge"; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant. Dann then began developing foreign versions of Sesame Street by arranging what were eventually termed co-productions, or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, Sesame Street had expanded into 140 countries; The New York Times reported during 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, divided between the Workshop and Henson Associates.|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo versa sobre o desvelamento das representaÃÃes simbÃlicas dos educadores sociais de rua e de parte dos educadores de acolhimento institucional dos programas estatais CrianÃa Fora da Rua Dentro da Escola e Ponte de Encontro, pertencentes, respectivamente, ao Governo do Estado do CearÃ e Ã Prefeitura de Fortaleza, que atendem crianÃas e adolescentes em situaÃÃo de vulnerabilidade social. Foram examinados os valores que guiam sua prÃtica educativa, as motivaÃÃes para o ingresso e exercÃcio dessa profissÃo, as perspectivas projetadas para o resultado dessa atividade e sua avaliaÃÃo e demandas referentes Ãs suas condiÃÃes de trabalho, com vista a perceber que elementos estes sujeitos trazem para a operacionalizaÃÃo de sua atividade, para alÃm do que Ã preconizado por suas entidades empregadoras. Constatou-se que existem pontos em comum no que se refere aos valores que orientam a aÃÃo do educador, mas estes encontram diferentes condiÃÃes para convertÃ-los em prÃtica, {{conforme}} o modelo de atendimento de cada programa. As motivaÃÃes foram tipificadas e encontrou-se interconexÃes entre elas e as demais representaÃÃes estudadas. Verificou-se tambÃm grande insatisfaÃÃo com as condiÃÃes de trabalho e perda de perspectiva de continuar em sua atual funÃÃo pela maior parte dos investigados. Foi percebido tambÃm que existem diferentes habitus profissionais entre os educadores que estÃo relacionados com sua trajetÃria anterior, condiÃÃo de ingresso na instituiÃÃo, tipos de motivaÃÃo e que tipo de concepÃÃes e formas de trabalho sÃo adotadas por cada organizaÃÃo estudada.

The present research examines the motivations for entering and exercising the profession, the values &# 8203;&# 8203;which guide their educational practice, the prospects for the projected result of this activity and the demands regarding their working conditions, in order to realize what elements these subjects bring to the operationalization of their activity, beyond what is recommended by their employers. Common characteristics were identified with regard to the values &# 8203;&# 8203;that regulate the action of the educators, but they found different conditions to convert them into practice, according to the model of care related to each program. The motivations were typified and interconnections between them were discovered and other representations studied. It was also verified great dissatisfaction with working conditions and loss of perspective to continue in their current role by most educators investigated. It was noticed that there are different professional habitus among educators, which are related to their previous work experiences, conditions of entrance into those institutions, types of motivation and what kind of conceptions and working methods are adopted by each organization researched...|$|R

The event took place on July 23 rd and 24 th, 2008 at the NOAA facility in Silver Spring, MD. The conference celebrated the 25 th anniversary of Dr. Sally Ride’s first flight into space in 1983 and examined how our understanding of Earth has changed in those 25 years. One {{the first day of the}} conference, participants heard a keynote talk delivered by Dr. Sally Ride, followed by presentations by well-known climate change scientists: Dr. Richard Somerville, Dr. Inez Fung and Dr. Susan Solomon. These sessions were concurrently webcast and made available to educators who were unable to attend the conference. On the second day of the conference, participants attended breakout sessions where they performed climate change activities (e. g. “Neato Albedo!”, “Greenhouse in a Bottle”, “Shell-Shocked”) that they could take back to their classrooms. Additional break-out sessions on using remote sensing images to illustrate climate change effects on Earth’s surface and how to address the climate change debate, were also offered. During lunch, participants attended an <b>Educator</b> <b>Street</b> Fair and had the opportunity to interact with representatives from NOAA, NASA, the EPA, NEEF and the JASON project. A follow-up evaluation survey was administered to all conference attendees immediately following the conference to evaluate its effectiveness. The results of this survey were overwhelmingly positive. The conference materials: presentation Power Points, workshop handouts and activities were available for teachers to download after the conference from the Sally Ride Science website. In summary, the approximately $ 55 K support for the Department of Energy was used to help plan, deliver and evaluate the “Earth Then, Earth Now: Our Changing Climate”, conference which took place on July 23 rd and 24 th, 2008 at the NOAA facility in Silver Spring, MD...|$|R
