50|$|In typical modern U.S. residences, {{about one-third}} of the HVAC energy {{consumption}} is due to infiltration. Another third is to ground-contact, and the remainder is to heat losses and gains through windows, walls, and other thermal loads. As such, reducing infiltration can yield significant energy savings, with rapid payback. In cold climates, with a 15 MPH wind, residences often have air exchange rates of 1.0 to 1.5 ACHs, far in excess of the ventilation air needs and are thus called loose construction. It is very easy to reduce infiltration rates to less than 1.0 ACH. <b>Smoke</b> <b>candles</b> and blower-door tests can help identify less-than-obvious leaks. The Weatherization article describes methods for energy savings further. If infiltration is reduced below 0.35 ACH, it is recommended that mechanical ventilation (typically an exhaust fan or heat recovery ventilation) be implemented.|$|R

2500|$|This {{would imply}} there were {{survivors}} {{in the forward}} compartments of the submarine, and {{a report by the}} Lochranza pier master of seeing <b>smoke</b> <b>candles</b> on the surface gives further weight to this theory. [...] Those not killed in the initial flooding in the aft compartments might have therefore attempted to use the forward escape hatch to leave the submarine and tried {{to make it to the}} surface, an endeavour that ultimately ended in failure. [...] The submarine was not reported overdue until the following morning, and search vessels were finally deployed to the area twenty three hours later. [...] It was during this time that a spotter plane observed a small concentrated patch of oil over what is now known to be Vandal's position. Three hours later this patch had drifted away and dispersed. [...] All other hatches and external openings to the sea were discovered to be closed, and there were no external signs of hull damage, or collision.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has described the}} restructuring of particles upon exposure to organic vapours; however, as yet hypotheses able to explain this phenomenon are limited. In this study, a range of experiments were performed to explore different hypotheses related to carbonaceous particle restructuring upon exposure to organic and water vapours, such as: the effect of surface tension, the role of organics in flocculating primary particles, {{as well as the}} ability of vapours to “wet” the particle surface. The change in mobility diameter (dm) was investigated for a range carbonaceous particle types (diesel exhaust, petrol exhaust, cigarette <b>smoke,</b> <b>candle</b> smoke, particles generated in a heptane/toluene flame, and wood smoke particles) exposed to different organic (heptane, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide/water (1 : 1 vol%) mixture) and water vapours. Particles were first size-selected and then bubbled through an impinger (bubbler) containing either an organic solvent or water, where particles trapped inside rising bubbles were exposed to saturated vapours of the solvent in the impinger. The size distribution of particles was simultaneously measured upstream and downstream from the impinger. A size-dependent reduction in dm was observed when bubbling diesel exhaust, particles generated in a heptane/toluene flame, and candle smoke particles through heptane, ethanol and a dimethyl sulfoxide/water (1 : 1 vol %) mixture. In addition, the size distributions of particles bubbled through an impinger were broader. Moreover, an increase of the geometric standard deviation (σ) of the size distributions of particles bubbled through an impinger was also found to be size-dependent. Size-dependent reduction in dm and an increase of σ indicate that particles undergo restructuring to a more compact form, which was confirmed by TEM analysis. However, bubbling of these particles through water did not result in a size-dependent reduction in dm, nor in an increase of σ. Cigarette smoke, petrol exhaust, and wood smoke particles did not result in any substantial change in dm, or σ, when bubbled through organic solvents or water. Therefore, size-dependent reduction in the dm upon bubbling through organic solvents was observed only for particles that had a fractal-like structure, whilst particles that were liquid or were assumed to be spherical did not exhibit any reduction in dm. Compaction of fractal-like particles was attributed to the ability of condensing vapours to efficiently wet the particles. Our results also show that the presence of an organic layer on the surface of fractal-like particles, or the surface tension of the condensed liquid do not influence the extent of compaction...|$|E

50|$|For {{the attack}} on 1 July, 56th Divisional Engineers had No 2 Company of 5th Battalion, Special Brigade, RE, {{attached}} to provide a smokescreen using 4 inch Stokes Mortars and <b>smoke</b> <b>candles.</b> E Section with 12 mortars was attached to 169th (3rd London) Bde, G Section with 8 mortars supported 168th (2nd London) Bde. The company began firing smoke bombs into the German line and lit its candles at 07.20, which provided a smokescreen across the division's attacking front before the artillery barrage lifted and the infantry went 'over the top' at 07.30. The smoke cloud slowly thinned, but it lingered for 45 minutes in the hollow in front of Gommecourt village and Nameless Farm, and {{on the far right}} No 20 Sub-section continued firing smoke bombs for 65 minutes. But the mortar positions at the heads of the British communication trenches were prime targets for the German artillery, and several mortar crews became casualties.

50|$|Despite the {{failures}} on 22 August, {{the beginning of}} another rainy spell on 23 August and a downpour on 26 August, when 19.6 mm of rain fell, the offensive continued. On 25 August, two companies of the 15th (Scottish) Division advanced behind a creeping barrage and a Stokes mortar bombardment, to attack Gallipoli and Iberian farms at 11:00 p.m. The Scottish reached Gallipoli, only to be shot down from behind by a hidden machine-gun, then were caught in crossfire from the farm buildings and a derelict tank. The survivors fell back and dug in on a line 170 yd forward of the start line; during the attack, a patrol towards Iberian Farm was also repulsed. A 61st Division attack on Aisne Farm failed and in the XVIII Corps area, the 48th Division captured more gun pits. On 27 August attacks were made by all the Fifth Army corps, II Corps on the right attacking at 4:45 a.m. and the corps to the north at 1:55 p.m. The attacking battalions had moved up during the night in rain {{and then had to}} remain hidden for ten hours, soaking wet in mud up to their knees, before attacking. Twenty minutes before zero hour, torrential rain began and high winds sprang up. Each man carried three <b>smoke</b> <b>candles</b> to form a smoke screen but they were soaked by the rain; the ground was covered in waterlogged shell-holes and became much muddier, causing to the infantry to lag behind the creeping barrage.
