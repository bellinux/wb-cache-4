25|$|Linerlock – Invented by Michael Walker, a Linerlock is {{a folding}} knife with a side-spring lock {{that can be}} opened and closed with one hand without {{repositioning}} the knife in the hand. The lock is <b>self-adjusting</b> for wear.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hydraulic}} {{disc brakes}} have a <b>self-adjusting</b> mechanism {{so as the}} brake pad wears, the pistons keep {{the distance from the}} pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same brake lever throw. Some hydraulic brakes, especially older ones, and most mechanical discs have manual controls to adjust the pad-to-rotor gap. Several adjustments are often required during the life of the pads.|$|E
25|$|The Linerlock is a locking {{mechanism}} for folding pocket knives. A Linerlock is a folding knife with a side-spring lock {{that can be}} opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand. The lock is <b>self-adjusting</b> for wear. The modern Linerlock traces its lineage to the late 19th century, but in the 1980s the design was improved by American custom knifemaker Michael Walker.|$|E

We propose an H. 264 /AVC encoder able to adaptively <b>self-adjust</b> the accu-racy of the motion-compensated prediction on the basis of the available power resources to achieve a progressive re-duction of the computational requirements with graceful degradation of the rate-distortion performance. 1...|$|R
25|$|The braking system, {{adapted from}} the DS, employs disc brakes at all four corners (the DS has drums at the rear), with the front brakes being inboard, and cooled via large ducts on the front {{underside}} of the car. The hydraulic braking pressure front to rear balance is <b>self-adjusting</b> according to the weight {{in the rear of}} the car, so on hard braking the entire car lowers evenly.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 {{model year}} saw the {{optional}} {{availability of a}} long 3.08 gear for improved fuel economy, but the Corvair otherwise remained largely carryover with minor trim and engineering changes. <b>Self-adjusting</b> brakes were new for 1963. The Monza line was really proving its worth. Of all the Corvairs sold in 1963 fully 80% were Monzas. The Convertible model counted for over 20% of all the Monzas sold. Sporty image means big profits.|$|E
25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} thought there would be little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. <b>Self-adjusting</b> brakes were added in 1959.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{function}} of traffic lights {{requires more than}} slight control and coordination to ensure that traffic moves as smoothly and safely as possible and that pedestrians are protected when they cross the roads. A variety of different control systems are used to accomplish this, ranging from simple clockwork mechanisms to sophisticated computerized control and coordination systems that <b>self-adjust</b> to minimize delay to people using the road.|$|R
40|$|Changes in two {{important}} monitoring mechanisms - ownership structure and board structure around restructuring events are examined. To examine ownership structure I use {{a sample of}} corporate spin-offs. To examine board structure I use a sample of acquirers in the banking industry. The results of the dissertation show that public corporations <b>self-adjust</b> their governance around events that require such adjustment. This dissertation significantly extends the literature that suggests that monitoring mechanisms arise endogenously...|$|R
40|$|A three-layered {{neural network}} that optimally <b>self-adjusts</b> {{the number of}} hidden layer units is proposed. The network {{combines}} two techniques: 1) Unit fusion which enables an efficient pruning of the redundant units. 2) Linear transformations applied to the chosen hidden layer unit pair output and a modified back-propagation training rule for gradual fusion to reduce pruning shocks. The network was applied to a character recognition problem and it adjusted itseft to a minimal configuration at high rate...|$|R
25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a <b>self-adjusting</b> equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market {{has been shown to}} be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E
25|$|The Edsel {{offers several}} {{features}} that were considered innovative for the time, including its rolling-dome speedometer; warning lights for such conditions as low oil level, parking brake engaged, and engine overheating; and its push-button Teletouch transmission shifting {{system in the}} center of the steering wheel (a conventional column-shift automatic was also available at a reduced price). Other Edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and <b>self-adjusting</b> brakes (which Ford claimed for the Edsel as a first for the industry, even though Studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade). The Edsel also offers such features, advanced for the time, as seat belts (which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes) and child-proof rear door locks that could only be unlocked with the key.|$|E
500|$|By 1939, all {{the major}} car makers were using unassisted {{hydraulic}} brakes; Ford {{was the last to}} switch from cable-manipulated systems. [...] Power-assisted Vacuum servo brakes had been invented in 1903, but did not become generally available as an option until the 1950s. <b>Self-adjusting</b> brakes initially were offered on the 1957 Mercury and 1958 Edsel, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. Buick offered power brakes as standard equipment on several of its vehicles by the 1954 model year.|$|E
30|$|Price-based {{programs}} may fail without technologies that enable automated response. According to [18], consumers, especially residential consumers, may not self-respond to prices {{in a meaningful}} manner. The largest TOU pricing pilot in the U.S. operated by Puget Sound Energy was discontinued. It turned out {{that a number of}} consumers had to pay more than they do under flat tariffs [5]. The lesson is that one can lose consumers’ time and attention by asking them to manually <b>self-adjust</b> their usage behaviors.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of the nonequilibrium invaded cluster (IC) algorithm, which reestablishes a correct scaling of fluctuations at criticality and also <b>self-adjusts</b> to the critical temperature. We show that by introducing a single constraint to the intrinsic quantity of the IC algorithm the temperature becomes well defined and the sampling of the equilibrium ensemble is regained. The procedure is applied to the Potts model in two and three dimensions. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures. to be published in Phys. Rev. E Rapid Communication...|$|R
40|$|We {{designed}} Adaptive Neuromorphic Architecture (ANA) that <b>self-adjusts</b> its inherent parameters (for instance, the resonant frequency) naturally {{following the}} stimuli frequency. Such an architecture {{is required for}} brain-like engineered systems because some parameters of the stimuli (for instance, the stimuli frequency) are not known in advance. Such adaptivity comes from a circuit element with memory, namely mem-inductor or mem-capacitor (memristor’s sisters), which is history-dependent in its behavior. As a hardware model of biological systems, ANA {{can be used to}} adaptively reproduce the observed biological phenomena in amoebae...|$|R
500|$|Armstrong was {{involved}} in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore and/or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. The first occurred during his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, while Armstrong tested a <b>self-adjusting</b> control system. He flew to a height of over [...] (the highest he flew before Gemini 8), but the aircraft nose was held up too long during descent and the X-15 bounced off the atmosphere back up to [...] At that altitude, the air is so thin that aerodynamic surfaces have almost no effect. He flew past the landing field at Mach3 (...) at over [...] in altitude, and ended up [...] south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he {{turned back toward the}} landing area, and barely managed to land without striking Joshua trees at the south end. It was the longest X-15 flight in both time and distance from the ground track.|$|E
2500|$|While the Edsel's {{front end}} design was {{considered}} [...] "weird" [...] or [...] "too different" [...] by contemporary buyers and critics, many other car manufacturers (such as Pontiac, Jaguar, BMW, Subaru, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, and Saab) have employed similar vertical grilles successfully {{in their car}} designs. [...] Many of the Edsel's features, such as <b>self-adjusting</b> brakes, gear selection by steering wheel buttons, etc., which were considered [...] "too impractical" [...] in the late 1950s, are now standard features of sports cars.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to the public, the Edsel did {{not live up to}} its preproduction publicity, even though it did offer many new features, such as <b>self-adjusting</b> rear brakes and automatic lubrication. [...] While Ford's market research had indicated that these and other features would make the [...] "E" [...] car attractive to them as car buyers, the Edsel's selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Upon seeing the price for a base model, many potential buyers simply left the dealerships. [...] Other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped top-of-the-line model.|$|E
40|$|The ever-growing {{use of the}} Internet {{comes with}} a surging {{escalation}} of communication and data access. Most existing intrusion detection systems have assumed the one-size-fits-all solution model. Such IDS is not as economically sustainable for all organizations. Furthermore, {{studies have found that}} Recurrent Neural Network out-performs Feed-forward Neural Network, and Elman Network. This paper, therefore, proposes a scalable application-based model for detecting attacks in a communication network using recurrent neural network architecture. Its suitability for online real-time applications and its ability to <b>self-adjust</b> to changes in its input environment cannot be over-emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|Ratcheting CVTs are {{distinguished}} from VDPs and roller-based CVTs by being static friction-based devices, {{as opposed to}} being dynamic friction-based devices that waste significant energy through slippage of twisting surfaces. An example of a ratcheting CVT is one prototyped as a bicycle transmission protected under [...] in which strong pedalling torque causes this mechanism to react against the spring, moving the ring gear/chainwheel assembly toward a concentric, lower gear position. When the pedaling torque relaxes to lower levels, the transmission <b>self-adjusts</b> toward higher gears, accompanied by an increase in transmission vibration.|$|R
40|$|One {{possible}} {{solution of the}} cosmological constant problem involves a so-called $q$-field, which <b>self-adjusts</b> so as to give a vanishing gravitating vacuum energy density (cosmological constant) in equilibrium. We show that this $q$-field can manifest itself in other ways. Specifically, we establish a propagating mode ($q$-wave) in the nontrivial vacuum and find a particular soliton-type solution in flat spacetime, which we call a $q$-ball by analogy with the well-known $Q$-ball solution. Both $q$-waves and $q$-balls are expected {{to play a role}} for the equilibration of the $q$-field in the very early universe.

2500|$|The {{third stage}} of {{development}} was the appearance of [...] "real" [...] digital hearing aids. In DHA all stages of sound processing are carried out in binary form. To do this, an external sound from a microphone first converted into a binary code, and after the conversion the reverse transformation is carried out (to analog signal transmitted by the ear speaker {{in the form of}} sound). The first [...] "real" [...] DHA were models developed by Graup in 1970 {{on the basis of the}} 8080 microprocessor, which replaced the analog components (amplifier, limiter and filters). The possibilities of a programmable processor made the device <b>self-adjusting,</b> which opened the prospects for the use of advanced signal processing techniques, noise reduction, etc. Although the 8080th processor was relatively slow and big in size.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cable cars}} are pulled by a cable running below the street, {{held by a}} grip that extends from the car through a slit in the street surface, between the rails. Each cable is [...] in diameter, running at a {{constant}} speed of , and driven by a [...] electric motor located in the central power house (see below), via a set of <b>self-adjusting</b> sheaves. Each cable has six steel strands, with each strand containing 19 wires, wrapped around a sisal rope core (to allow easier gripping). [...] The cables are coated with a tar-like material {{which serves as a}} sacrificial lubricant - much like a pencil eraser erodes away rather than the paper. To start and stop the movement of the car, the gripman (see below) closes and opens the grip around the cable (similar to the clutch of a conventional car). The grip's jaws exert a pressure of up to [...] on the cable.|$|E
2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically <b>self-adjusting.</b> Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the principles of}} building a moving vision platform (a Rig) that once calibrated can thereon <b>self-adjust</b> to changes in its internal configuration and maintain an Euclidean representation of the 3 D world using only projective measurements. We term this calibration paradigm "OmniRig ". We assume that after calibration the cameras may change critical elements of their configuration, including internal parameters and centers of projection. Theoretically we show that knowing only the rotations between a set of cameras is sufficient for Euclidean calibration even with varying internal parameters and unknown translations. No other information {{of the world is}} required. 1...|$|R

50|$|Officially sanctioned {{balls are}} {{designed}} to be as symmetrical as possible. This symmetry {{is the result of a}} dispute that stemmed from the original Polara, that had six rows of normal dimples on its equator but very shallow dimples elsewhere. This asymmetrical design helped the ball <b>self-adjust</b> its spin-axis during the flight. Over 300,000 balls were sold. The United States Golf Association refused to sanction it for tournament play and, in 1981, changed the rules to ban aerodynamic asymmetrical balls. Polara's producer sued the USGA and the association paid US$1.375 million in a 1985 out-of-court settlement.|$|R
