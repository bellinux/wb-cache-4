500|$|The {{draft of}} the {{application}} to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper [...] "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" [...] by Elena Shchukina and Sergei Shishkov focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for {{the scope of the}} evaluated case. While talking about appealing against [...] "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the [...] "parallel" [...] examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{the result}} of a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal,</b> {{augmented}} by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 {{under the auspices of the}} Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year's study to a single prizewinner. With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel. The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer's life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain's major music colleges. In 2012, the Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier's birth [...] and in February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the [...] "Britons of Distinction" [...] stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius.|$|E

50|$|As the centenary {{of their}} grandfather's birth approached, the reduced {{circumstances}} of Charles Jr.'s daughters {{led to a}} public fundraising appeal.

50|$|The {{application}} was {{considered in the}} paper “Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation” by E.Y. Shchukina and S.N. Shishkov. It attacked the admissibility of appeals against expert reports without regard for {{the scope of the}} case. According to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, while talking about “the reports”, the paper mistakenly conflates the reports with actions of the experts (or the institution) and asserts the impossibility of “parallel” examinations. However, abuse of rights and legitimate interests of citizens, including trial participants, may be a subject for a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

He remained Mayor of Mumbai 1935 to 1936. However, following the provincial elections of 1937 in the Bombay Presidency in which Congress secured majority, he was passed over {{in the selection of}} the chief minister in favour of B. G. Kher.

Gandhi responded to a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal,</b> but could find no proof for Nariman's complaints.|$|E
50|$|The {{trustees}} of Madeleine's Fund announced in September that the fund {{would not be}} used to pay the McCanns' legal costs.

However, Richard Branson created a fund for the McCann's legal expenses, including those of their current advisor, Michael Caplan QC, a solicitor and partner in the London firm of Kingsley Napley. Stephen Winyard came out in December as having contributed £100,000 to the McCanns' defence fund, which paid for DNA tests carried out on the Renault Scénic hire car used by the McCanns. He also revealed Brian Kennedy as another donor.|$|E
5000|$|Although never {{formally}} {{charged in}} the pardons matter, Blanton was eventually indicted on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy, and extortion for selling liquor licenses. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} federal prison. Released after serving 22 months, he returned to Tennessee. Although a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals initially reversed the convictions because {{of the way in which}} the district court conducted the voir dire, that decision was vacated by the court's decision to re-hear the case en banc. The full Sixth Circuit Court affirmed Blanton's convictions, and the Supreme Court denied review. [...] In January 1988, 9 of the 11 charges were thrown out in a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

All four appeals were dismissed. Despite the failure of his appeals there was considerable doubt about Ratten's conviction, many believing he was found guilty for the questionable morality of his marital infidelity rather than concrete evidence. His case was widely discussed among the legal fraternity while his cause was taken up by many notable lawyers and politicians, such as Don Chipp.|$|R

50|$|C. George Swallow {{was convicted}} of tax evasion and filing false tax returns. In 1962, his {{convictions}} were upheld on appeal. In 1963, in a <b>separate</b> <b>appeal,</b> the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also rejected (1) his argument that the income tax laws and regulations are so complex {{that it is impossible}} for a taxpayer to comprehend and comply with them, and that the tax laws therefore violate the Fifth Amendment, (2) his argument that the income tax laws are unconstitutionally arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory; (3) his argument that the tax proceeds are used for unconstitutional purposes such as the economic welfare of certain groups of taxpayers, foreign people, and foreign governments; and (4) his argument that certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code violate the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} differences in emotional responses of 806 respondents exposed to Personal or Historical Nostalgic advertising appeals using experimental research design. Five emotions common to both conditions are revealed and significant changes in intensity of these emotions are explored. As hypothesised, emotions are significantly more intense under the Personal Nostalgic condition compared to the Historical, although not in all five emotion components. This research highlights the need to treat Nostalgia as two <b>separate</b> <b>appeals</b> and provides insight useful to practitioners about these distinct reactions. It also suggests the need for future research into Personal and Historical Nostalgia?s effects...|$|R
5000|$|Their {{attorneys}} filed <b>separate</b> <b>appeals</b> at the State Supreme Court in September 2010 for Adamcik and in April 2011 for Draper, respectively.

The first appeal for Adamcik was denied in a 3/2 decision, as was Draper's appeal. The high court vacated Draper's conviction on conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, saying that jurors were given erroneous instructions on that charge, but they affirmed his conviction for first-degree murder and life sentence without parole.|$|R
5000|$|In R v Goldstein and Rimmington (2005) UKHL 63 [...] two <b>separate</b> <b>appeal</b> {{cases were}} {{considered}} together. The Lords began their judgment with a detailed {{review of the}} law and its history. Two arguments were raised by the defence. The first was that most of the factual situations that might otherwise have been criminal public nuisances, had now been covered by statutes. Thus, for example, s1 Protection from Harassment Act 1997 would now be used in cases involving multiple telephone calls, and s63 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 confers powers on the police to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave [...] "at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality". These statutes had, in effect, made the common law offence redundant and it should no longer be considered an offence in English law. The Lords agreed that, as a matter of practice, all alleged offences falling within the remit of statutes would now be charged under those statutes. It also accepted that this left only a very small scope for the application of the common law offence. But, just as the courts had no power to create new offences (R v Withers), and could not widen existing offences so as to retrospectively criminalise conduct (R v Misra and Srivastava (2004) EWCA Crim 2375), it equally had no power to abolish existing offences. However, cases such as R v Norbury and R v Johnson (Anthony) would now be charged under the relevant statutes.|$|E
50|$|The Tribunal {{follows the}} inquisitorial system which is {{standard}} in Iraq and uses investigative judges. Trials are heard before {{a panel of}} the five Trial Judges, who conduct hearings, pronounce judgements and impose the sentences, without using a jury.

The statute of the court allows for international judges to be appointed on {{the request of the}} court and approval of the Council of Ministers, but none have yet been appointed.Judges were initially appointed to a five-year term by the Iraqi Governing Council, in consultation with the Iraqi Judicial Council.|$|R
50|$|Sywest gained {{approval}} by the Pleasant Hill City Council for its proposal {{to tear down the}} theater and redevelop the property for a two-story, 73,000+ square-foot building to house a Dick's Sporting Goods. Supporters of the theater submitted two <b>separate</b> <b>appeals</b> to overturn the approval of demolition: one by a resident of Pleasant Hill, and one by Save the Pleasant Hill Dome (SPHD) organization. Both appeals were voted down by a majority of the city council; Mayor Michael G. Harris and councilmember Ken Carlson voted in favor of the appeal. SyWest had the Dome demolished on May 8, 2013, precluding any further court action.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology (1980), former member Larry Wollersheim sued the {{organization}} for mental distress, and was awarded $30million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5million. In 1996, Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney's fees incurred while defending against a church lawsuit that was dismissed for violating a California law prohibiting strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Church vowed not to pay the award, and the case dragged through the courts for 22 years, including two <b>separate</b> <b>appeals</b> to the Supreme Court of the United States and two additional appeals to the Supreme Court of California. In early 2002, the case was finally settled, with the Church of Scientology paying Larry Wollersheim $8,674,643.|$|R
50|$|Although both Cobb and Cochran made <b>separate</b> <b>appeals</b> {{for years}} {{afterward}} to restart a women's astronaut testing project, the U.S. civil space agency did not select any female astronaut candidates until Astronaut Group 8 in 1978, which selected astronauts for the operational Space Shuttle program. Astronaut Sally Ride {{became the first}} American woman in space in 1983 on STS-7, and Eileen Collins {{was the first woman}} to pilot the Space Shuttle during STS-63 in 1995. Collins also became the first woman to command a Space Shuttle mission during STS-93 in 1999. In 2005, she commanded NASA's return to flight mission, STS-114. At Collins' invitation, seven of the surviving Lovelace finalists attended her first launch, ten of the FLATs attended her first command mission, and she has flown mementos for almost all of them.|$|R
40|$|Many {{environmental}} campaigns highlight {{both the}} environmental and financial benefits of behaviour change, {{in the hope of}} motivating a broad audience. But are such mixed appeals more persuasive than <b>separate</b> <b>appeals?</b> We argue that messages tailored to match recipient's prioritised values are more persuasive than combined appeals. We conducted a questionnaire study to assess the persuasiveness of economic, environmental, and mixed appeals (N = 210). As expected, individual differences in values moderated the persuasive power of the different appeals. Importantly, we found that appeals that matched the recipients' values were more persuasive than the combined appeal. Interestingly, personal norms also acted as a moderator. These findings suggest that environmental campaigns aimed to induce behavioural change can benefit from tailoring persuasive messages to idiosyncratic characteristics of their target group, rather than employing a one-size-fits-all message...|$|R
