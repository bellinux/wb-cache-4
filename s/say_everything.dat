500|$|In late 1967, the WCPAEB {{released}} {{their third}} album, Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), {{which was the}} band's most ambitious, albeit less consistent than its predecessor, work to date. The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to <b>say</b> <b>everything</b> we wanted to say, {{in the way we}} wanted to say it". For the first time, each track was credited either {{in whole or in part}} to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition [...] "Smell of Incense" [...] was issued just ahead of Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), but it failed to chart. The Dallas psychedelic pop group Southwest FOB covered the song in 1968, which reached No.56 on the Billboard Hot 100. Among its ten tracks, the album included the politically-satirical [...] "In the Arena", possibly inspired by the Watts riots. Vol. 2 (Breaking Through) also features the anti-war song [...] "Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes", the full version of [...] "Smell of Incense", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on [...] "Unfree Child".|$|E
500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to <b>say</b> <b>everything</b> that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can." ...|$|E

Even the baseball itself is a story -- one of geography and symbolism -- an almost holy relic of American culture. Sportswriter Steve Rushin tells the story of these objects in his latest book, The 34-Ton Bat." ...|$|E
3000|$|You know, I love {{coming down}} [to the {{transplant}} center] because it saved my life, but now it’s {{getting to the}} point of everybody here <b>saying</b> <b>everything’s</b> okay. All of these tests and stuff like that, so it’s getting to a point where, ‘do I have to keep on coming down?’ I like coming down, but do I have to come down to hear them <b>say</b> <b>everything’s</b> okay?

2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because she could <b>say</b> <b>everything</b> only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything {{in front of my}} eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geffen {{opted to}} refer to the breakup as an [...] "indefinite hiatus," [...] and label {{president}} Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that [...] "any press you do, make sure you <b>say</b> <b>everything</b> is cool." [...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange to be talking about music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom was telling us that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] We never did anything about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. [...] "We were recording and we didn't want the cops showing up at our house at 2 a.m. because we were recording drums," [...] remembered Hoppus.|$|E

60|$|She {{did not say}} anything, {{but turned}} {{and walked back to}} Captain Ichabod. She found that tall gentleman {{somewhat}} agitated; he seemed to have a great deal on his mind which he wished to say, feeling, at the same time, that he ought to <b>say</b> <b>everything</b> first.|$|E

5000|$|Well, I {{really want}} to {{encourage}} a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it - I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think {{we live in an}} age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's <b>saying,</b> <b>everything's</b> <b>saying</b> 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.|$|R
