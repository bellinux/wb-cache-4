The boundary-induced contribution is effectively a nonthermal correction, which enhances or weakens the nonthermal effect already present in the unbounded case, thus possibly making the effect easier to observe. An interesting feature worth being noted is that the nonthermal corrections may vanish for atoms on some particular trajectories. Comment: 19 pages, no figures, Revtex...|$|E
