40|$|Tumor {{engineering}} {{is defined as}} the construction of three-dimensional (3 D) tumors in vitro with tissue engineering approaches. The present 3 D scaffolds for tumor engineering have several limitations in terms of structure and function. To get an ideal 3 D scaffold for tumor culture, A 549 human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells were implanted into immunodeficient mice to establish xenotransplatation models. Tumors were retrieved at 30 -day implantation and <b>sliced</b> into <b>sheets.</b> They were subsequently decellularized by four procedures. Two decellularization methods, Tris-Trypsin-Triton multi-step treatment and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment, achieved complete cellular removal and thus were chosen for evaluation of histological and biochemical properties. Native tumor tissues were used as controls. Human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells were cultured onto the two 3 D scaffolds for further cell growth and growth factor secretion investigations, with the two-dimensional (2 D) culture and cells cultured onto the Matrigel scaffolds used as controls. Results showed that Tris-Trypsin-Triton multi-step treated tumor sheets had well-preserved extracellular matrix structures and components. Their porosity was increased but elastic modulus was decreased compared with the native tumor samples. They supported MCF- 7 cell repopulation and proliferation, as well as expression of growth factors. When cultured within the Tris-Trypsin-Triton treated scaffold, A 549 cells and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (SW- 480) had similar behaviors to MCF- 7 cells, but human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells (KYSE- 510) had a relatively slow cell repopulation rate. This study provides evidence that Tris-Trypsin-Triton treated acellular tumor extracellular matrices are promising 3 D scaffolds with ideal spatial arrangement, biomechanical properties and biocompatibility for improved modeling of 3 D tumor microenvironments...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Fifty-three strains {{from six}} {{species of the}} genus Bacillus were tested {{for their ability to}} produce gelatinase and to {{disintegrate}} the collagen matrix of bone. Some strains of B. cereus and B. anthracis produced a true collagenase which brought about complete disinte,mtion of the collagen substrate, while strains of B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. brevis and B. megaterium were either completely inactive or produced only partial disintegration. Collagenase production was always accom-panied by gelatinase production but the reverse was not the case. Concentrated culture filtrates of B. cereus were shown to contain collagenase and gelatinase, whereas those of B. subtilis contained gelatinase only. In a previous communication (Evans & Wardlaw, 1952) we described some of the properties of proteolytic culture filtrates from a strain of Bacillus subtilis. The culture filtrates were highly active in liquefying gelatin and in disinte-grating hide powder which is a denatured form of skin collagen. The filtrates were, however, unable to break down undenatured tendon collagen either in the form of thin <b>slices</b> or thin <b>sheets</b> prepared from soluble collagen by th...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{evolution}} in the Palaeoproterozoic Banded Iron Formation of SW Egypt The exposed basement of the Western Desert of Egypt {{is part of the}} pre-Pan-African East Sahara Craton. The Gabel Uweinat-Bir Safsaf Aswan Uplift is situated at the eastern fringe of this craton, and its high-grade metamorphic and granitoid rock associations are markedly distinct from the metavolcanic-metasedimentary-ophiolitic sequences of the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Nubian Shield). Crystalline basement rocks cover an area of some 40, 000 km 2 in SW Egypt. The fieldwork and mapping of the basement rocks in the present area were carried out during the winters 1998, 1999 and at last in 2001 for altogether about 10 months of fieldwork. A detailed field geologic-structural map to the scale of 1 : 60, 000 and two cross sections, perpendicular to the regional structural trend for the whole area, are prepared using vertical aerial photographs and Landsat images. Detailed petrographic studies of the different rock units were carried out to determine their compositional character and the effect of deformation on each rock unit. Some 125 rock specimens representing the different rock units were collected and more than 130 thin sections were examined petrographically using the polarizing microscope. Microstructure studies and (analyses) attempted to determine the structural evolution and possible transport direction from about 40 oriented thin sections parallel and perpendicular to the foliation. Further structural data, from the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was determined from 31 oriented samples, which were cored and cut (200 cylinders). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were analyzed with the Kappa bridge. The BIF is exposed as an upper unit, while anatexite forms a middle one, underlain by ultramafic-mafic units. The BIF shows large quartz crystals with wavy extinction and undeformed recrystallized quartz. The Anatexite sequences were affected by granulite facies metamorphism, followed by a retrograde metamorphism. The petrographic study shows some orthopyroxene crystals altered to hornblende, biotite and chlorite. The structural analysis of the area indicated that it was subjected to major tectonic deformation including folding, overthrusting, shearing and faulting. The area is built up of thrust slices of the BIF and Anatexite, which extend for more than 25 km in N 15 °E direction, dipping to the west with angles between 30 ° to 70 °. The thickness of slices horses is up to 4 km. The thrust sequence in this area has about 20 km width. Thrust Faults have been derived from overturned folds, the shear surface replacing one of the limbs of the fold. The structure is dominated by a series of nearly parallel, minor thrust faults, or high angle reverse faults, which dissect the rock into <b>slices,</b> <b>sheets,</b> plates, blocks or wedges that are approximately equidistant and have the same displacement and are all steeply inclined to the WNW (285 °). Restoration of this thrust sequence shows that the anatexite forms a basement to the overlying BIF. Both metamorphic banding in the anatexite and the layering in the BIF restore to a horizontal primary orientation. The Deformational Evolution Three major deformation phases can be discerned in the study area (D 1, D 2 and D 3), the three phases D 1, D 2 and D 3 affected only the basement rocks and are followed by Phanerozoic brittle deformation affecting both the basement and the overlying sedimentary rocks in the investigated area. The D 1 structures indicate a crustal thickening followed by crustal thinning and developed the melano- and leucosome in the Anatexite sequences. A foliation (S 1) observed in the thin section of the BIF as simple shear mylonitization zones. Generally in (D 1) the Anatexite bands are parallel with the mylonitic shear zones in the BIF. The D 2 structures dominate in the BIF as a micro and macro folding (F 2) associated with low angle thrust or shear zones (S 2). In the Anatexite and the Ultramafic-mafic sequences minor folds with the same characters as in the BIF are observed. Generally in (D 2) the BIF and Anatexite bands had E-W strike and dipped shallowly to the south (S 2), and contain minor folds (F 2) with E-W axial surfaces. The D 1 and D 2 deformations are both of them overprinted by the D 3 structures, which refolded the F 2 at a perpendicular direction of the fold axes by F 3. The D 3 affected refolding and thrusting at the BIF, Anatexite sequences and Ultramfic-mafic bands as F 3 and S 3. The F 3 has NNE trend and plunge with an angle of 15 °. The foliation S 3, is parallel to the fold axial surfaces and thrust surfaces. The dip angle ranges between 30 ° and 70 ° to the WWN (285 °) ...|$|R

The literature review discussed {{the future of}} the automobile and its possible prime movers. It concluded that gasoline direct injection (G-DI) engines have the potential to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations except for their excessive unbumt hydrocarbon emissions. Further studies are necessary to understand the causes and to investigate possible methods of reduction. A prototype cylinder head was stWplied by Jaguar Cars Ltd. and a cylinder block and piston were designed and manufactured to provide optical access to study the fuel spray interactions. The design featured a piston with a deep bowl, three versions of which were made. One was nonoptical (for benchmark testing), the second had a thin quartz <b>slice</b> to allow <b>sheet</b> illumination, while the third had a quartz disc set in the base of the bowl. The most suitable optical methods for the investigation were assessed. Mie scattering and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) were chosen for their ability to show fuel in liquid and vapour form and their compatibility with an existing laser unit. The Mie tests were performed using pump gasoline with the engine firing. The main variables were injection timing, engine temperature and optical access through the piston.. The LIP tests used the firing engine, but a three-component hydrocarbon fuel replaced gasoline. The fuel components were chosen to represent the evaporative behaviour of gasoline, but not to fluoresce. A dopant in known concentration was added to provide the fluorescence. Images were recorded using a charge-coupled device camera. Extensive image post-processing was performed to correct for background illumination, window fouling and light-sheet intensity variation.. Finally, a comparison was made between the Mie and the LIP images, also taking into account corresponding ambient air fuel spray images. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Serpentinite {{is known}} to be an {{important}} constituent of oceanic crust and is particularly abundant along zones of primary structural weakness. Such primary weaknesses occur along fracture zones where large ultramafic massifs are commonly exposed, and along ridge-parallel serpentinite belts that are emplaced near slow-spreading ridges. Tectonic disruption of newly formed crust along transform segments of fracture zones in conjunction with, and followed by, the solid state injection of serpentinitic rocks leads to the development of serpentinite-matrix melange as a primary constituent of oceanic crust. Slumping of rocks along transform axial deep walls and ponding of pelagic and, locally, turbiditic sediments produce an array of additional chaotic rocks, which also belong to the fracture zone regime. Inasmuch as the total length of fracture zone crust on the ocean floors far exceeds the length of subduction and collision zones, and whereas fracture zones are commonly on the order of 50 km wide, geologists working in melange belts of orogenic zones should be aware of fracture zone processes and products. Geological relations in a number of on-land ophiolitic melange and nappe belts, and deformation patterns in modern oceanic environments, where changes in rotational poles have occurred over the recent geologic past, suggest that ophiolite obduction and perhaps intra-oceanic subduction zones develop along primary structural weaknesses, particularly fracture zones. The initial imbricate structural sequences in such environments consist of ophiolitic melange, large ultramafic <b>slices</b> and ophiolite <b>sheets</b> along fracture zones, and ophiolite sheets with basal dynamothermal aureoles where thrusting initiates along or near spreading ridge segments. Such imbricate sequences constitute oceanic orogenic welts that may experience a considerable oceanic residence time prior to accretion within a collisional suture belt or along a subducting trench or that may slide by gravitational forces onto deeply submerged continental shelves or oceanic plateaus. Oceanic orogenic welts, along with large unmodified fracture zone massifs, should be considered similar to oceanic plateaus in regard to their susceptibility for tectonic accretion. Tectonic accretion of the welts often disrupts the initial imbricate sequence, leaving high temperature metamorphic blocks and slices of ophiolitic melange scattered along the base of ultramafic or ophiolitic nappes. In many instances, it is clear that dynamothermal metamorphism and ophiolitic melange mixing pre-date continental margin obduction and the related suturing event. Ophiolitic melange may constitute an important element in uplifted subduction complexes, {{but it is not clear}} that “normal” ridge-crest ocean crust is technically mixed into melange within inner trench wall environments. Pre-mixed fracture zone assemblages are highly susceptible to accretion in such environments, because of their pre-weakened state, bathymetric expression, and their gravitational instability with respect to “normal” oceanic crust. In addition to en masse accretion of fracture zone crust, ophioutic melange components in subduction complexes are probably also derived by the diapiric movement of oceanic serpentinites away from the downgoing slab. Such rising serpentinites may carry with them deep-seated metamorphic blocks and are susceptible to intermixing with higher-level components of the accretionary prism by solid state injection, surface breachment, and olistostromal recycling. The point stressed in this paper is that many serpentinitic assemblages of orogenic zones are the result of polystage developmental histories with heritages that commonly stem from primary serpentinitic assemblages of the ocean floor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical {{data that}} {{constrain}} the hydrothermal alteration and gold mineralization in the Um El Tuyor area, SE Egypt. In order {{to distinguish the}} characteristics and envisage the genesis of gold mineralization in the study area, insights into the geologic context, structural evolution and geochemistry of the country rocks are provided. The geochemical investigations have been integrated with field and petrographic relationships, along with Landsat (TM) imagery interpretations to better constraints on the tectonic setting of the basement complex in the study area. The particular geographic location near the intersection of two major high strain zones, namely the Allaqi-Heiani suture and Hamisana Shear Zone, {{played a crucial role}} in the deformation history of the Um Tuyor area. The basement complex cropping out in the Um El Tuyor area is part of the Neoproterozoic Allaqi-Heiani ophiolitic belt, comprising allochtonous ophiolitic thrust <b>slices</b> and detached <b>sheets,</b> island arc volcano-sedimentary-plutonic assemblages, and syn-orogenic and post-orogenic intrusions. The ophiolitic rocks exhibit field and geochemical characteristics that make them akin to the supra-subduction zone ophiolites, formed most likely in a back-arc basin. The island arc assemblage comprises mainly calc-alkaline metavolcanic-plutonic rocks and back-arc pelitic metasediments. Early calc-alkaline granite intrusions tapered along the foliation and thrust planes during the orogenic episodes, whereas less fractionated tholeiitic olivine gabbro and peraluminous monzogranite encompass a course of post-orogenic plutonism evolved in a within plate setting. An early period of crustal shortening (Dm) involved transportation and overriding of huge ophiolitic sheets from the north to south is manifested by major thrust faults and imbricate ophiolitic thrust slices. Regional folds and pervasive foliation cleavage signify a NE-SW compressional regime (D 2) superimposed on the thrust fabrics. A third deformation increment is indicated by the presence of abundant NNW-trending major folds and left-lateral faults superimposed on the older structural fabrics (D 3). D 4 records an episode of transcurrent deformation yielded slip reactivation of the pre-existing NW-trending faults and formation of discrete shear zones, one of which accommodates gold mineralization in the study area. Finally, a weak shear strain (D 5) is indicated by the intersecting fault and joint trends traversing the post-orogenic rocks. Regional metamorphism was coeval with deformation, and peaked under conditions of amphibolite facies during D 2. Geothermobarometry calculations point to temperatures of 534 - 561 oC and pressure of 5. 26 - 6. 20 kbar for the peak of the metamorphic path of Um El Tuyor basement. Gold is mainly confined to the quartz veins and less commonly to narrow domains of the next quartz-sericite alteration zones. Field, microscopic and microprobe observations suggest that hydrothermal alteration in the Um El Tuyor mine area was post-peak metamorphism, and syn-kinematic with local shearing. The main auriferous veins in the Um El Tuyor mine area consist of massive, partially recrystallized, or laminated quartz ±carbonate. The quartz-carbonate veins are essentially fault-fill bodies, which have been fractured and re-filled with milky to grey laminated quartz in later stages of the geothermal system. The laminated quartz veins contain narrow elongate slivers of the host pelitic rocks (composed essentially of chrorite-sericite-sulphides±graphite), assumed to have been peeled off and incorporated during incremental (crack-seal) vein growth. vii Gold occurs as inclusions or within the lattice in arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite, commonly in association with subordinate sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite in the auriferous quartz veins. Another, high fineness type of gold fills microfractures in sulphides and quartz, and/or occurs as dispersed blebs and globules in domains of pervasive alteration, particularly where sericite and carbonate are intergrown. In the mine area, a metal zonation extends from an inner Fe-As-Zn-Au ±Pb±Ag±Te bearing veins through an intermediate Fe-As-Cu rich wallrocks to a distal halo enriched in Fe-Cu-Co, and Ni. A three stage hydrothermal alteration model (initial, transitional and advanced) is proposed for the Um El Tuyor ore-forming hydrothermal system, on basis of the field and microscopic observations and the electron microprobe data. The initial stage involved hydrolysis of the wallrocks in presence of a near acid fluid, whose pH was buffered by the wallrock mineralogy. The transitional stage involved also hydrolysis reactions, but was dominated by carbonatization, sulphidation and redox reactions. The latter reduced the interacting fluids, particularly where the fluid : rock ratio was low and provided favourable conditions for gold deposition. It is interpreted that sulphidation has affected the gold solubility via changes in oxygen fugacity through redox reactions. The advanced stage was most likely a phase of intense sericitization (after chlorite), which consumed K+, liberated H+, and buffered the solution pH. Cation-exchange reactions were limited to the time when favoured Na+ activity and temperature conditions promoted deposition of albite. Sulphidation remained operating through this stage, and the un-buffered conditions were locally attained under high fluid/rock ratios. Compositional zoning of the auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite crystals, along with the presence of patchy pyrrhotite and sphalerite inclusions in these crystals, and the absence of these features in pyrite and arsenopyrite of the late sulphide assemblage may imply incipient low oxygen fugacity conditions during gold deposition. Further, compositional zoning of the large arsenian pyrite crystals, from barren cores to auriferous margins, is considered as a function of redox reactions involving oxidation of Au and reduction of As. Fluid inclusion studies revealed heterogeneous entrapping of immiscible aqueous and carbonic fluids in the Um El Tuyor auriferous quartz veins. Criteria including the primary and secondary modes of occurrence of the carbonic inclusions, coexistence of inclusions with carbonic and aqueous fluids of variable relative proportions, densities, filling degrees, partial homogenization temperatures, and bulk compositions are considered evocative for phase separation as gold deposition mechanism in the Um El Tuyor auriferous quartz veins. The initially homogenous ore fluid was likely a low salinity aqueous-carbonic solution (± 1 - 2 mol% CH 4 or N 2), which started to separate into two phases and precipitate gold when conditions attained ~ 340 °C at ~ 1. 5 kbar (at depth of ~ 6 km under lithostatic condition). Destabilization of gold-sulphur complexes through interplay of cooling, redox state variation, pH changes, and decrease in sulphur fugacity should have contributed in gold deposition in the auriferous veins. The entire gold-base metal mineralization and quartz veining event extended over conditions of 170 - 429 oC at 0. 9 - 2. 1 kbar respectively, equivalent to depths of 3 - 8 km and compatible with crustal conditions of greenschist metamorphism and brittle–ductile transition. This wide range of pressure probably represents the total fluid pressure regime within the shear zone from the formation of the auriferous quartz veins to periods of continuous pressure decrease during uplift, including a sudden pressure decrease occurred as a consequence of incremental opening of the fissure, followed by filling by newly deposited quartz. Diese Dissertation beschreibt die petrographischen, mineralogischen und geochemischen Hintergründe, die zur Goldmineralisation und zur hydrothermalen Nebengesteinsalteration im Gebiet von Um El Tuyor, Südost Ägypten beigetragen haben. Um jedoch die genetischen Hintergründe und Charakteristika der Goldmineralisation im Untersuchungsgebiet näher zu verstehen, bedarf es zunächst einer eingehenden Analyse der geologischen Zusammenhänge, der strukturgeologischen Entwicklungsgeschichte und Geochemie der gesamten Nebengesteinsabfolgen. Die geochemischen Auswertungen wurden in die Feldarbeiten und die petrographischen Untersuchungen eingebunden, ebenso die Satellitenbildinterpretationen (TM-Szenen) zum besseren Verständnis der Tektonik des Grundgebirges im Untersuchungsgebiet. Die spezielle geographische Position des Um El Tuyor Gebietes im Umfeld der Überschneidung von zwei „high strain“ Suturzonen, nämlich des Allaqi-Heiani Gürtels und der von Süden kommenden Hamisana Zone trug wesentlich sowohl zu deren komplexen Deformationsgeschichte als auch Lagerstättengenese bei. Der anstehende Grundgebirgskomplex des Um El Tuyor Gebietes stellte sich als ein Teil des Neoproterozoischen Allaqi-Heiani Ophiolit Gürtels heraus, der aus allochtonen ophiolitischen Überschiebungspartien und abgesonderten Schuppen vulkano-sedimentärer und plutonischer Abfolgen vom Inselbogentyp sowie syn-und post-orogener Intrusionen besteht. Die ophiolitischen Gesteine lassen sich sowohl nach den Geländedaten als auch geochemisch als Supra-Subduktionszonen-Ophiolite eines Back-Arc Beckens deuten. Während des Pan-African (Spätes Proterozoikum) wurden diese Ophiolite transportiert, durch mittlere bis steile Verfaltung verkürzt und verschuppt wobei sie immature Inselbogenabfolgen mit zwischengeschalteten Back-Arc Metasedimenten überlagerten. Die Inselbogenabfolge besteht hauptsächlich aus kalk-alkalinen metavulkanisch-plutonischen Gesteinen und pelitischen Back-Arc Metasedimenten. Frühe kalk-alkaline Granitintrusionen drangen entlang der Faltungs- und Überschiebungflächen während der orogenen Episoden ein, wohingegen tektonisch weniger beanspruchte Olivin-Gabbros und Peraluminium-Mozogranite sich als postorogene Plutonite mit einer „Within plate“ Affinität darstellen.
