5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Peter Turcan, who also developed similar turn-based <b>strategies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Waterloo and Borodino for home computers in the 1980s. Austerlitz is presented in a 3D perspective over a battlefield; however, it features no sound. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release.

5|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} September 1939, Lang saw his main duty as the {{preservation}} of spiritual values during what he deemed to be an honourable conflict.

Lang was sympathetic to the Sword of the Spirit campaign, founded by Cardinal Hinsley in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 Lambeth Palace, Lang's London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use <b>strategies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing <b>strategies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{appears to}} have met with several conspiracies during his reign, one of which led to his {{eventual}} assassination in 96. The first significant revolt arose on 1 January 89, when the governor of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, rebelled against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Chatti. The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain, although it {{appears to have}} been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military <b>strategies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus. At any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, whilst Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard. By a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid. Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.|$|E

30|$|The {{principle}} of probabilistic methods {{is to reduce}} the probability of high PAPR by generating several OFDM symbols (multiple candidates) carrying the same information and by selecting the one having the lowest PAPR. The probabilistic method can also be classified into two strategies: subblock partitioning strategy and entire block strategy. The subblock partitioning <b>strategy,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> partial transmit sequence (PTS) [6 – 8], divides frequency domain signals into several subblocks. On the other hand, the entire block <b>strategy,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> selected mapping (SLM) [8 – 10] and interleaving [11 – 13], considers the entire block for generating multiple candidates.|$|R

5|$|Wrecking Racing {{was meant}} to enable {{a broad range of}} <b>strategies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> keeping up but {{watching}} out for destruction opportunities, destroying the cars in front, and destroying everything without concern for position. This was hard to balance, but it proved possible to win with each of those strategies. Edmondson came up with Stock Car Racing after watching the Banger World Finals at Arena Essex and noticing that there were some cars simply racing rather than trying to destroy each other. The normal race mode was implemented simply because the engine could support running a traditional race. For Destruction Derby mode, more varied arenas were implemented {{to take advantage of a}} new physics system developed by Reflections. Edmondson decided against implementing features such as speed boosts and collectibles because he did not want the game to feel like an arcade game and wanted the car physics to be as realistic as possible. Destruction Derby 2 was released on the PlayStation in 1996, and a PC version soon followed. The next instalment in the Destruction Derby series, Destruction Derby Raw, was released in 2000.|$|E
