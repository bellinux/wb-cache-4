5|$|A {{suite of}} fossils {{known as the}} Small <b>shelly</b> fossils are {{represented}} in the Ediacaran, most famously by Cloudina a <b>shelly</b> tube-like fossil that often shows evidence of predatory boring, suggesting that, while predation {{may not have been}} common in the Ediacaran Period, it was at least present.|$|E
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the <b>shelly</b> fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other <b>shelly</b> fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the <b>shelly</b> fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these <b>shelly</b> fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E
