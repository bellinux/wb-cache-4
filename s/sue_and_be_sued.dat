2500|$|The United States {{congress}} passed a series of Acts aimed at combating segregation. The first such act, The Civil Rights Act of 1866, states in subsections 1981, 1981a, and 1982 that all persons born in the United States are citizens regardless of their race, color, or previous condition and as citizens they could make and enforce contracts, <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>sued,</b> give evidence in court, and inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real estate and personal property. Although this act was passed, it was never enforced on the local, state or national level. A second act, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, through Title VI outlawed segregation in public schools and public places. It also made it illegal to have segregation of the races in schools, housing, or hiring. Like the first act, powers given to enforce it were weak in the beginning, but were later supplemented. [...] A third act, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, subsection 3604, expanded on the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and sex. This section is {{also referred to as}} the Fair Housing Act. This act is enforced at the national level by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond union {{governance}} {{through the}} vote and elections, members have five main statutory rights. First, although statute asserts that a union is [...] "not a body corporate", in every practical sense it is: it can make contracts, commission torts, hold property, <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>sued.</b> The union's executives and officials carry out actions on its behalf, and their acts are attributed to it by ordinary principles of agency. However, if any union official acts ultra vires, beyond the union's powers, every member {{has a right to}} claim a remedy for the breach. For example, in Edwards v Halliwell a decision of the executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders to increase membership fees was restrained, because the constitution required a two-third vote of members first. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 28 requires unions to keep accounts, giving a [...] "true and fair" [...] view of its financial affairs. Records are kept for six years, members have a right to inspect them, they are independently audited and overseen by the Certification Officer. Third, members have a right to not give contributions to the trade union's political fund, if there is one. Since the early success of the UK Labour Party in promoting working people's welfare through Parliament, both courts and Conservative governments attempted to suppress unions' political voice, particularly compared to funding by employers through control of corporations. Under TULRCA 1992 sections 72, 73 and 82, a union must hold a separate fund for any [...] "political object" [...] (such as advertising, lobbying or donations), members must approve the fund by ballot at least every 10 years, and individual members have a right to opt-out of it (unlike shareholders in companies). Unions must also have political objects in the constitution. In 2010, just 29 from 162 unions had political funds, though 57 per cent of members contributed. This generated £22m. Consolidated statistics on corporate political spending, by contrast, are not available.|$|E
6000|$|The {{majesty of}} Leaphigh stood aghast, by proxy! It would seem Noah had now {{actually}} {{fallen into a}} more serious error than the mistake he had made with the king. By the law of Leaphigh, the queen is not a feme couverte. She can <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>sued</b> in her own name, holds her separate estate, without the intervention of trustees, and IS {{supposed to have a}} memory, a will, an inclination, or anything else in that way, except a [...] "royal pleasure," [...] to which she cannot, of right, lay claim. As to her, the king's first-cousin is a dead letter; he having no more control over her conscience than he has over the conscience of an apple-woman. In short, her majesty is quite as much the mistress of her own convictions and conscience as it probably ever falls to the lot of women in such high stations to be the mistress of interests that are of so much importance to those around them. Noah, innocently enough, I do firmly believe, had seriously wounded all those nice sensibilities which are naturally dependent on such an improved condition of society. Forbearance could go no further, and I saw, by the dark looks around me, that the captain had committed a serious crime. He was immediately arrested, and conducted from the presence to an adjoining room, into which I obtained admission, after a good deal of solicitation and some very strong appeals to the sacred character of the rights of hospitality.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a matter}} of {{interpretation}} of the word [...] "person" [...] in the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. courts have extended certain constitutional protections to corporations. The basis for allowing corporations to assert such protections under the U.S. Constitution {{is that they are}} organizations of people, and the people should not be deprived of their constitutional rights when they act collectively. Thus, treating corporations as having legal rights allows corporations to <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> to <b>be</b> <b>sued,</b> provides a single entity for easier taxation and regulation, simplifies complex transactions that would otherwise involve, in the case of large corporations, thousands of people, and protects the individual rights of the shareholders as well as the right of association.|$|R

500|$|From a legal perspective, Hungarian {{society was}} divided into freemen and serfs, but {{intermediate}} groups also existed. All freemen had the legal capacity to own property, to <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> to <b>be</b> <b>sued.</b> Most of them were bound to the monarch or to a wealthier landlord, and only [...] "guests" [...] could freely move. Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the [...] "castle warriors" [...] served in the army, and the [...] "castle folk" [...] cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the [...] "pennies of freemen" [...] to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked the legal status available to freemen, but in practice {{they had their own}} property: they cultivated their masters' land with their own tools, and kept 50–66percent of the harvest for themselves. StephenI's laws and charters suggest that most commoners lived in sedentary communities which formed villages. An average village was made up of no more than 40 semi-sunken timber huts with a corner hearth. Many of the villages were named after a profession, implying that the villagers were required to render a specific service to their lords.|$|R
40|$|São analisados aspectos relativos à ação de desapropriação por utilidade pública, tais como sua natureza, condições e elementos. A partir da linha dogmática de pesquisa, utiliza-se metodologia dialética. Apóia-se em fontes imediatas jurídico-formais de pesquisa documental (legislação, doutrina e jurisprudência). Visando a uma melhor identificação do objeto da desapropriação, que poderá atingir bens móveis ou imóveis, direitos e interesses sem qualquer discriminação, busca-se distinguir coisas de bens, procedendo-se a uma verificação das diferentes classes de bens. Também, tendo em vista que a desapropriação modifica um direito real, qual seja o direito de propriedade, considerando suas próprias características, estabelece-se a diferença entre os direitos reais e os direitos pessoais ou obrigacionais; discorre-se sobre a origem e evolução histórica da propriedade, seu objeto, conteúdo e elementos, dando ênfase à sua função social. Estudam-se, ainda, as formas de aquisição, limitação e extinção desse direito. Quanto à desapropriação, faz-se seu histórico; apresenta-se-lhe o conceito doutrinário formulado tanto por administrativistas como por civilistas; analisam-se aspectos relacionados com sua natureza jurídica, fundamentos, elementos e objeto. O ato por meio do qual o Poder Público manifesta sua intenção de expropriar também é analisado. Finalmente, quanto à ação de desapropriação por necessidade pública, ao se estabelecerem suas condições, demonstra-se que o pedido é juridicamente admissível, nos termos da lei; busca-se identificar quem são os legitimados a figurar na relação jurídico-processual e o interesse que justifica sua propositura. Por outro lado, como as ações podem ser identificadas por meio de certos elementos, tais como as partes (elemento subjetivo), o pedido e {{a causa de}} pedir (elementos objetivos), são eles apontados. Conclui-se, também, que, ante a evolução do direito de propriedade e do próprio direito processual, fazem-se necessárias alterações na legislação vigente, para que ela melhor possa disciplinar a matéria, ante esse novo contextoThis {{dissertation}} {{is intended}} to analyse issues regarding the action of expropriation for purposes of public use. Aspects such as {{the nature of this}} action, the conditions for its filing, its elements, are herein examined. The dogmatic line of reasearch <b>is</b> adopted, <b>and</b> the dialetical methodology is used. This work has been based on immediate formal sources of documental law research (legislation, academical production, case law). In order to better identifying the object of expropriation, which may consist of chattel or realty, rights and interests alike, a distinction between assets <b>and</b> rei <b>is</b> delineated, by means of a verification of the many sorts of assets. Morevoer, taking into account that expropriation modifies a ius in re, which is the right of ownership, and in attention to the very characteristics of the last, a differentiation between ius in rem and ius in personam is carried out. The right of ownership is examined, as regards its origin, historical evolution, object, having its social function been emphasized. The forms of acquisition, limitation and extincition of the so mentioned right are also studied. As for expropriation itself, its history is considered closely. The academical definition of expropriation is herein presented, in its elaboration by so many Administrative and Civil law scholars, that contains various aspects regarding its fundaments, elements and objetct. The act whereby the State manifests the intention to expropriate is also analized. In respect of the action of expropriation for purposes of public need, it is demonstrated that the motion is juridically admissible, in the terms of the law. 18 Effort has been made in order to identifying the persons and entities that hold the capacity to <b>sue</b> <b>and</b> to <b>be</b> <b>sued,</b> <b>and</b> also the kind of interest that make such motion justified. On the other hand, considering that actions may be identified through the examination of certain elements, like the parties, the motion and the cause of action, these elements are studied. In conclusion, it is stated that, in attention to the evolution of the right of ownership and procedural law as well, modifications in present legislation are needed, for the purpose of a better handling of the matter, concerning the contemporary contex...|$|R
