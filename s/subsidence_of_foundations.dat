30|$|The static of masonry arches, when {{a finite}} {{displacement}} at the springing occurs, is {{examined in this}} paper. This problem is worthy of interest since small displacements of the supports in the existing masonry arches and vaults can take place due to different causes, including the <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> system, viscous phenomena affecting the mortars, and movements of underlying structures. Consequently, the structure can reach a condition of collapse because of gradual changes in its geometry. A typical example is represented by arch or vault supported on piers. In this case, if displacements of the supports arise, the span increases, the rise decreases, and a growth of the arch thrust occurs, giving rise to a further movement of the springing, up to the failure condition.|$|R
30|$|Masonry arch {{systems and}} vaulted {{structures}} constitute a structural typology widely {{spread in the}} historical building heritage. Small displacements of the supports, due to different causes, among which <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> systems or movements of underlying structures can lead the masonry arch to a condition of collapse because of gradual change in its geometry. This paper presents a tool, based on a kinematic approach, for the computation {{of the magnitude of}} the displacements that cause the collapse of circular arches subject to dead loads, and allows the evaluation of the related thrust value. A parametric study has been carried out in order to develop {{a deeper understanding of the}} influence of the involved parameters. In addition, analytic formulations of the maximum allowed displacement and the associated thrust are proposed. Finally, a case study related to the behavior of a masonry arch on spreading-induced abutments is undertaken and discussed.|$|R

When using 3 D elements for creation of a 3 D model, it is, in particular, essential to choose correctly the size of the modelled area which represents the subsoil, the boundary conditions and the size of the finite element network.

50|$|The {{building}} as seen {{today is the}} result of extensive work carried out under the supervision of George Gilbert Scott, starting in 1868. Scott's design originally called for a high central tower and spire, but this was never completed as cracks appeared which were thought to indicate <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>foundations.</b> The tower was therefore left as a low structure. In 1879 £11,000 was spent on the restoration of the nave, chapter house and central tower. Lord Penrhyn contributed £2,000.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 17th century a new timber-framed church was built under the {{direction}} of the district magistrate (Amtsmann), Carl Dietrich. A clock tower was only built after the church had been finished, around 1624, but it stood slightly apart from the main church building. Due to <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>foundations</b> and rotting <b>of</b> the ground timbers this had become unsound by the middle of the 18th century. A survey carried out in 1745 recommended a new building, so the planned renovation measures were abandoned and a new church was planned.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to {{characteristics}} and surrounding environments <b>of</b> a deep <b>foundation</b> pit with pile-anchor retaining structure, a monitoring program was developed. The monitoring focused on horizontal displacements <b>of</b> retaining piles, <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> soil surrounding <b>foundation</b> pit and settlements <b>of</b> buildings near <b>foundation</b> pit. The {{results show that}} the maximum displacements are in middle position of sides and at corners <b>of</b> <b>foundation</b> pit. The horizontal displacements and settlements of pits are efficiently rejected by anchors. The displacements <b>of</b> buildings near <b>foundation</b> pit are affected by many factors, such as the excavation speed and anchor. The displacement exists characteristics of time and spatial effects. The monitoring results provide a reliable basis for the safety construction and rational organization of construction...|$|R
5000|$|On February 29, 1980, the {{building}} was immediately closed after the inspection by construction experts. The reason was a strong <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>foundation</b> {{as well as the}} moulding of the supporting piles. In an ADN -message the same day it said: [...] "No performances will be offered in March. The City Council of Berlin has, in the interest of public safety,been forced to close down the facilities. The constant monitoring of the palace by the state supervision as well as several special investigations have revealed a deterioration <b>of</b> the <b>foundation</b> construction." [...] Thus passed that evening the last performance. Although closed as a venue, the main house of the ensemble was subsequently used as a rehearsal stage. Even the magazine, the workshops and administrative buildings continued to be utilised. After the ensemble moved to the new building in 1985, demolition of the almost 120-year-old building began almost immediately.|$|R

50|$|The {{instruments}} are {{in most cases}} huge structures. The scale {{to which they have}} been built has been alleged to increase their accuracy. However, the penumbra of the sun can be as wide as 30 mm, making the 1mm increments of the Samrat Yantra sundial devoid of any practical significance. Additionally, the masons constructing the instruments had insufficient experience with construction of this scale, and <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>foundations</b> has subsequently misaligned them. The samrat yantra, for instance, which is a sundial, can be used to tell the time to an accuracy of about two seconds in Jaipur local time. The Giant Sundial, known as the Samrat Yantra (The Supreme Instrument) is one of the world's largest sundials, standing 27 metres tall. Its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6 cm) every minute, which can be a profound experience to watch.|$|R
60|$|One other {{supposition}} {{to account}} for the position of encircling barrier-reefs remains, but it is almost too preposterous to be mentioned; namely, that they rest on enormous submarine craters, surrounding the included islands. When the size, height, and form of the islands in the Society group are considered, together with the fact that all are thus encircled, such a notion will be rejected by almost every one. New Caledonia, moreover, besides its size, is composed of primitive formations, as are some of the Comoro Islands (I have been informed that this is the case by Dr. Allan of Forres, who has visited this group.); and Aitutaki consists of calcareous rock. We must, therefore, reject these several explanations, and conclude that the vertical thickness of barrier-reefs, from their outer edges to the foundation on which they rest (from AA in the section to the dotted lines) is really great; but in this, there is no difficulty, for {{it is not necessary to}} suppose that the coral has sprung up from an immense depth, as will be evident when the theory of the upward growth of coral-reefs, during the slow <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> their <b>foundation,</b> is discussed.|$|R

60|$|In {{the three}} first chapters, the {{principal}} kinds of coral-reefs were described in detail, {{and they were}} found to differ little, as far as relates to the actual surface of the reef. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier-reef only {{in the absence of}} land within its central expanse; and a barrier-reef differs from a fringing-reef, in being placed at a much greater distance from the land with reference to the probable inclination <b>of</b> its submarine <b>foundation,</b> and {{in the presence of a}} deep-water lagoon-like space or moat within the reef. In the fourth chapter the growing powers of the reef-constructing polypifers were discussed; and it was shown, that they cannot flourish beneath a very limited depth. In accordance with this limit, there is no difficulty respecting the foundations on which fringing-reefs are based; whereas, with barrier-reefs and atolls, there is a great apparent difficulty on this head; in barrier-reefs from the improbability of the rock of the coast or of banks of sediment extending, in every instance, so far seaward within the required depth;--and in atolls, from the immensity of the spaces over which they are interspersed, and the apparent necessity for believing that they are all supported on mountain-summits, which although rising very near to the surface-level of the sea, in no one instance emerge above it. To escape this latter most improbable admission, which implies the existence of submarine chains of mountains of almost the same height, extending over areas of many thousand square miles, there is but one alternative; namely, the prolonged <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>foundations,</b> on which the atolls were primarily based, together with the upward growth of the reef-constructing corals. On this view every difficulty vanishes; fringing reefs are thus converted into barrier-reefs; and barrier-reefs, when encircling islands, are thus converted into atolls, the instant the last pinnacle of land sinks beneath the surface of the ocean.|$|R

Groundwater is a substantial source of providing drinking and agricultural water in Iran which has resulted in excessive groundwater withdrawal and ground subsidence. In Rafsanjan Plain, subsidence rate is 10 percent of water-level decrease rate [18]. <b>Subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 900  mm {{as a result of}} a 15  m drop in Mashhad Plain [16], and <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> 200  m in Hashtgerd are some of the examples in Iran [6].
