40|$|The tooling {{concepts}} and manufacturing techniques developed to produce subelements and full-scale bonded test articles {{for two of}} the NASA Composites for Advanced Transportation Systems are examined as part of the structural development of graphite/polyimide composite material systems for the Space Shuttle Orbiter and other space transportation systems. The subassembly and the assembly bonding of the test articles were accomplished using <b>self-tooling</b> and low-cost aluminum tooling concepts in order to eliminate the need for complex and expensive tools. Processing procedures and tooling approaches were developed which permit controlled pressure application on specific bonding planes. Two test articles were fabricated using these techniques, an acoustic panel and a quarter segment of the Space Shuttle aft body flap...|$|E
40|$|A modular, {{laminated}} {{solar panel}} {{approach has been}} demonstrated which uses high efficiency cells and allows application {{to a variety of}} smallsat footprints without customizing each application. The module design includes a contiguous integral shield which protects the solar cells more effectively from a variety of space environments, and also provides electromagnetic cleanliness to protect sensitive instruments from solar array generated EMI. The laminated approach also provides significant cost reduction by incorporating <b>self-tooling</b> and reducing the number of steps and processes needed to assemble a solar panel from individual cells. Modularity leads to standardization, which allows process controls and inherently improved reliability. A number of alternative cell and module sizing approaches were considered {{to meet the needs of}} smallsats which often have small and discontinuous surface areas available for solar cell strings. The modular laminated solar panel provides a means of obtaining reliable, efficient panels for smallsats at an acceptable cost...|$|E
