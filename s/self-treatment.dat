5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for <b>self-treatment</b> by patients with myalgia. They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment {{within a few days}} or weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from <b>self-treatment</b> upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{psychological}} and legal counseling are recommended since <b>self-treatment</b> may not release stress or remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities {{may not have}} the desired effect, may be ignored, or may further injure the victim at its response.|$|E
5000|$|The {{deployment}} of <b>self-treatments</b> have costs {{as well as}} benefits {{with the result that}} evolution has selected management processes in the brain such that <b>self-treatments</b> are used only when they provide an overall cost-benefit advantage. The brain controls such physiological process through top-down regulation.|$|R

25|$|Evolutionary {{medicine}} identifies many {{symptoms such as}} fever, pain, and sickness {{behavior as}} evolved responses to protect or enhance the recovery from infection and injury. Fever, for example, is an evolved <b>self-treatment</b> that removes bacteria or viruses through raised body temperature. These evolved responses, however, also have a cost that depending upon circumstances can outweigh their benefit (due to this, for example, there is a reduction in fever during malnutrition or late pregnancy). According to the health management system theory proposed by Nicholas Humphrey, the brain has been selected to ensure that evolved responses are deployed only when the cost benefit is biologically advantageous. To do this, the brain factors {{in a variety of}} information sources, including the likelihood derived from beliefs that the body will get well without deploying its costly evolved responses. One such source of information is the knowledge the body is receiving care and treatment. The placebo effect in this perspective arises when false information about medications misleads the health management system about the likelihood of getting well so that it selects not to deploy an evolved <b>self-treatment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} <b>self-treatment</b> of {{insomnia}} to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries {{to make up for lost}} time by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Christman {{joined the}} {{division}} of Scientology called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organization. 3 News characterised the Sea Org as [...] "Scientology's senior management". In their book Cults and New Religions, Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing, [...] "Described by the Church as 'a fraternal religious order,' members of the Sea Org 'occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy'." [...] Rolling Stone notes, [...] "Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy". In 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org. Her Sea Org career was short lived; she was instructed to cease taking prescribed medication for her epilepsy, {{and as a result}} experienced multiple serious seizures. In one instance two of her front teeth came out after she suffered a fall caused by a seizure while in the bathroom. She recounted these incidents of seizures, in an interview with CBS News, [...] "So I started having grand mal seizures, and I wasn't even off the medicine. I was only off part of the medicine, and I started having very bad grand mal seizures." [...] Christman recalled that her epilepsy was not recognized as a genuine medical condition by the Scientology organization; whose practice was to instruct members to attempt <b>self-treatment</b> utilizing saunas and vitamins.|$|E

5000|$|Mental health {{literacy}} {{has been defined}} as [...] "knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention.

The concept of mental health literacy was derived from health literacy, which aims to increase patient knowledge about physical health, illnesses, and treatments.|$|R
50|$|Many men {{attempt to}} treat {{themselves}} for premature ejaculation {{by trying to}} distract themselves, such as by trying to focus their {{attention away from the}} sexual stimulation. There is little evidence to indicate that it is effective, however, and it tends to detract from the sexual fulfilment of both partners. Other <b>self-treatments</b> include thrusting more slowly, withdrawing the penis altogether, purposefully ejaculating before sexual intercourse, and using more than one condom. Using more than one condom is not recommended as the friction will often lead to breakage. Some men report these to have been helpful.|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{explores the}} health seeking {{behaviors}} {{for children in}} the Garo indigenous community of Bangladesh drawing on medical pluralism theoretical framework. The thesis is based on one month-long fieldwork in a northern village of the country, Sainamari. In this village, different health care systems co-exist: the scientific medical system (missionary clinics, pharmacist, hospitals, village doctors, clinics), the traditional herbalists (Kabiraj), the spiritual healer (Khamal), {{and the use of}} household treatment system like home-remedies. This study analyzes how the parents define illnesses and seek therapies for their children’s health and use their indigenous cultural practices to health maintenance for their future generation. Although bio-medicine became the dominant model in terms of health care practices around the world, the Garo indigenous community still highly depends on <b>self-treatments,</b> like home-remedies and folk healers like the Kabiraj and the Khamal. The findings of this thesis contributes to the understanding of how the Garo people’s child healthcare in Bangladesh works...|$|R

5000|$|In 1972, Norman Lasker, a {{professor}} of Medicine at Jefferson Medical College, invented the Jefferson Cycler—the first at-home <b>self-treatment</b> device for dialysis patients.

50|$|A {{study of}} Luo {{children}} in western Kenya found that 19% reported engaging in <b>self-treatment</b> with either herbal or pharmaceutical medicine.

50|$|Another cause may be {{attempted}} <b>self-treatment</b> of diseases. One patient {{attempted to}} treat his chronic diarrhea by inserting an ear of maize into his rectum.

5000|$|There {{should also}} be a [...] "care plan" [...] in case of future exacerbations.

50|$|The health {{management}} system, in other words, {{when faced with}} an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is {{that the benefits of}} the <b>self-treatment</b> cease to outweigh its costs.

50|$|External {{medications}} {{will affect}} the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved <b>self-treatment.</b> Some animals use external ones.

50|$|The {{welfare of}} social animals (including humans) depends upon other {{individuals}} (social buffering).
