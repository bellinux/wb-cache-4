5000|$|In a 1930 review {{from the}} Research Service of the Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, Patridge {{identified}} {{confusion in the}} definition and application of the diagnosis of psychopathy, as it could cover almost any kind of personality deviation acutely or chronically, or only certain more specific conditions, or act virtually as a holder for any otherwise unclassified mental disorder. He also considers that the then common practice of calling it 'constitutional' was speculative, and that in fact very little was known about its causes or psychopathology, and indeed dissecting personality into the normal and abnormal is too complex, finely nuanced and individual. However, he concludes that a consistent factor linking most cases is persistent <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> with a motivation towards behavior with adverse effects on others, and he suggested that sociopathy would therefore be a more accurate and appropriate term. He indicates that the term psychopathy should no longer be used at all - having no usefulness in application to the antisocial group more accurately described as sociopathic, nor much use for the various remaining conditions not inherently chronicially antisocial, and certainly not to cover both groups at once. The Oxford English Dictionary (2011) definition of sociopath quotes from his 1930 article: [...] "We may use the term ‘sociopathy’ to mean anything deviated or pathological in social relations." [...] and [...] "We may exclude from the class of essential sociopaths those whose inadequacy is primarily related to physical weakness, fear, hypersensitiveness, shyness and self-blame." [...] In fact {{the first part of}} the quote in full is [...] "If we may use the term ‘sociopathy’ to mean anything deviated or pathological in social relations, whether of individuals with one another, or within or towards groups, and also in the relations of groups to one another, we have a fairly communicable meaning, and a term which may apply descriptively to a great number of persons". The phrase 'essential sociopath' was Partridge's attempt to describe the type with the most deep-rooted chronic antisocial motivations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adolescence is the {{developmental}} epoch during which children become adults – intellectually, physically, hormonally, and socially. Adolescence is a tumultuous time, full of changes and transformations. The pubertal transition to adulthood involves both gonadal and behavioral maturation. Magnetic resonance imaging studies {{have discovered that}} myelinogenesis, required for proper insulation and efficient neurocybernetics, continues from childhood and the brain’s region-specific neurocircuitry remains structurally and functionally vulnerable to impulsive sex, food, and sleep habits. The maturation of the adolescent brain is also influenced by heredity, environment, and sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone), which {{play a crucial role}} in myelination. Furthermore, glutamatergic neurotransmission predominates, whereas gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission remains under construction, and this might be responsible for immature and impulsive behavior and neurobehavioral excitement during adolescent life.

Thirty-four teachers from the region of Montreal, teaching students with special needs in the regular French immersion classroom, responded to four questionnaires and to two open-ended questions, and shared their views and attitudes toward inclusive education. Findings revealed that a positive attitude towards inclusion was related to positive teaching efficacy. Moreover, teachers' attitude varied across disabilities.

40|$|The basic {{economic}} and <b>social</b> <b>maladjustments</b> confronting American agriculture {{during the preceding}} two decades have stimulated a variety of studies {{and a variety of}} programs intended to correct the discrepancies in income. At first they were centered around methods of raising prices to farmers, often by placing a barrier between domestic and foreign prices, under the assumption that such price changes would correct the major portion of the unfavorable income position of the farm economy. As the programs and researches expanded and proliferated there was a growing realization that such broad, industry-wide approaches did very little to change the distribution of income within agriculture and was at least as likely to increase the range as to narrow it. In consequence an increasing number of special problem groups became the focus for a small coterie of workers; farmers on poor land, in drouth areas, migratory laborers and part-time farmers are a few examples of focal problems. Gradually these separate studies are being integrated into a study of disadvantaged classes of farmers-farmers {{at the lower end of}} the income scale. This reorientation promises to have much greater analytical significance since it focuses directly on the problem- low income-and attempts to discover the reasons or series of reasons for their income position, rather than orienting the whole study around one hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: to determine the predictors of psychological distress and <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> (i. e., social interaction, work, and home management functioning), to determine the relationship between specific coping strategies and psychological distress and <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment,</b> and {{to determine the effects}} of program participation on patients' level of personal mastery, cardiac functional capacity, frequency of stressors, and coping strategies. The sample comprised 223 males between the ages of 27 and 66 who had heterogeneous CHD diagnoses. The data were collected by means of standardized questionnaires using a mailing procedure which achieved a response rate of approximately 90 % across time points. The results of multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed that number of hassles and disengagement coping contributed significant increments to the variance explained in psychological distress. Higher levels of engagement and symptom management coping, however, were not found to be significant predictors of lower psychological distress in this study. For <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment,</b> in general, neither stress nor coping emerged as consistent predictors of <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> across time points. Coping consistently emerged as a stronger predictor of both psychological distress and <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> when current coping strategies were used as predictors (Model B), as opposed to when coping strategies from the previous time point were entered (Model A). Regarding the relationships among specific coping strategies and psychological distress and <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment,</b> the disengagement coping strategies had stronger positive correlations with psychological distress and one of the three <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> outcomes than did engagement coping, which had fewer and weaker positive correlations with these outcomes. Program participation did not predict personal mastery or use of coping strategies, but did predict fewer hassles. The number of physiotherapy sessions received predicted level of cardiac functional capacity. Furthermore, greater cardiac functional capacity was predicted by higher personal mastery, fewer hassles, lower psychological distress, and less impairment in domestic activity. This study demonstrates the importance of psychosocial variables as predictors of cardiac functional capacity, and provides empirical evidence that these variables moderate the relationship between physical status and recovery level. The findings concerning the identification of predictors of adjustment provide information for developing rehabilitation interventions for CHD patients. Patients' adjustment may be facilitated by reduction of hassles, limiting use of disengagement coping strategies, and strengthening personal mastery. The methodological strengths and weaknesses of this study are discussed, as are its implications for coping theory and research. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

However, it is not clear why only some develop this problem, difference in etiology could be one explanation. Aim: The aim of the study is to assess behavioral aggression in boys with sexual precocity due to different disorders. Materials and Methods: Seven children, ages three to seven years, were enrolled for this study. Two were diagnosed to have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), three had testotoxicosis, while two had central precocious puberty. Parents of children with precocious puberty underwent the (CASP) questionnaire (children′s aggression scale-parent version). Results: Testosterone levels were high in all patients. Parents denied any history of physical or verbal aggression in the two boys with CAH. Their CASP rating was 0. In contrast, the CASP ratings in the two boys with testotoxicosis and the two with precocious puberty for five domains ranged from 3. 1 - 24. 2, 2. 6 - 8. 3, 1 - 5. 6, 0 - 7. 1, and 0 - 1, respectively. In the present study, increased aggression was seen among all the patients with testotoxicosis and both with precocious puberty. In contrast, there were no symptoms of either increased verbal or physical aggression in either of the two patients with CAH. Conclusions: The hormonal milieu in the boys with CAH versus those with sexual precocity due to other causes differed in terms of cortisol and androgen precursors. The androgen excess in CAH children was a consequence of cortisol deficiency. It is possible that cortisol sufficiency is required for androgen-mediated behavioral effects...|$|R

The econometric method consists in a dynamic probit model with unobserved heterogeneity accounting for true state dependence and initial conditions problem. Consistently with the previous literature, we find that <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> during childhood determines a lower employment probability in adulthood. This result holds also after controlling for true state dependence and past working history. Interestingly, the adult employment probability of socially maladjusted children is prone to greater variability according to life experiences than that of socially adjusted children. We find that being employed in the previous period, education, young-adulthood working experiences and, for females, early working experiences increases the adult employment probability for all cohort-members. However the positive effect is stronger for socially maladjusted children and, overall, investment in higher education seems to be relevant. This suggests that interventions during life development for socially maladjusted children could be important to reduce inequality in adult employment probability. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to conduct a {{comprehensive}} assessment of the psychoneurological status, in particular depression and anxiety disorders, the level of <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment,</b> alexithymia in patients with relapsed duodenal ulcer (DU). We examined 25 patients with duodenal ulcer in age from 21 to 55 years, who underwent inpatient treatment on the basis of gastroenterology department of the regional clinical hospital, and 15 healthy individuals who meet clinical group’s age composition. The diagnosis of DU was made according to standardized protocols of diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the digestive system in accordance with the order of Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine № 271 dated 13. 06. 2005. To assess the psychoneurological status we used Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, which were filled by clinical interview. To determine the presence of stress life events in the morphogenesis of peptic ulcer we used Т. Holmes — R.  Rahe comparative scale of social adaptation in modification of Marx et al. (1975). Calculation of integral indicators of <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> has been carried out using scores of stress load of a life event. By indicators of <b>social</b> <b>maladjustment</b> in more than half of the surveyed patients with DU the level of stress resistance to maladjustment factors assessed as low — (378. 0 ± 34. 8) points. In patients with recurrent duodenal ulcer the level of alexithymia was (53. 7 ± 0. 3) points (p < 0. 05), personality type has been characterized as alexithymiс one...|$|E
40|$|Our war-time {{treatment}} of Japanese aliens and citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast has been hasty, unnecessary and mistaken. The {{course of action}} which we undertook {{was in no way}} required or justified by the circumstances of the war. It was calculated to produce both individual injustice and deep-seated <b>social</b> <b>maladjustments</b> of a cumulative and sinister kind. All in all, the internment of the West Coast Japanese is the worst blow our liberties have sustained in many years. Over one hundred thousand men, women and children have been imprisoned, some seventy thousand of them citizens of the United States, without indictment or the proffer of charges, pending inquiry into their 2 ̆ 2 loyalty. 2 ̆ 2 They were taken into custody as a military measure on the ground that espionage and sabotage were especially to be feared from persons of Japanese blood. They were removed from the West Coast area because the military thought it would take too long to conduct individual loyalty investigations on the ground. They were arrested in an area where the courts were open, and freely functioning. They were held under prison conditions in uncomfortable camps, far from their homes, and for lengthy periods—several years in many cases. If found 2 ̆ 2 disloyal 2 ̆ 2 in administrative proceedings they were confined indefinitely, although no statute makes 2 ̆ 2 disloyalty 2 ̆ 2 a crime; it would be difficult indeed for a statute to do so under a Constitution which has been interpreted to minimize imprisonment for political opinions, both by defining the crime of treason in extremely rigid and explicit terms, and by limiting convictions for sedition and like offenses. In the course of relocation citizens have suffered severe property losses, despite some custodial assistance by the Government. Perhaps 70, 000 persons are still in camps, 2 ̆ 2 loyal 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 disloyal 2 ̆ 2 citizens and aliens alike, more than three years after the programs were instituted. Although the process of relocation has been recently accelerated, many will remain in the camps at least until January 2, 1946...|$|R

In the theoretical part {{we describe the}} origin and creation of myths and we further define the variables that can affect the tendencies of teachers to myths about gifted pupils (length of teaching practice, type and grade of school). 973 teachers of primary and lower secondary schools from the Czech Republic participated in the research. A questionnaire was applied as a research technique. After exploratory factor analysis it included 7 statements distributed to two factors (F 1 : Education of gifted children; F 2 : <b>Social</b> and emotional <b>maladjustment</b> of gifted children). Based on these two factors, two summation indexes were created and compared in different groups of teachers. Results of the analysis show that teachers declare low tendencies to myths about gifted pupils. The overall results of comparison show, that the tendency to myths about gifted pupils is slightly decreasing as the length of teaching practice is increasing. Teachers working on the specialized schools for gifted children have higher tendency to myths about giftedness {{in comparison with the}} other types of schools. The tendency of teachers to myths is constant in the area of Education of gifted children and is decreasing in the area of <b>Social</b> and emotional <b>maladjustment</b> of gifted children.
