40|$|Aim. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to substantiate the role of nutrients in increasing soil fertility which contribute to the growth of economic efficiency of the main <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> crops for grain and grain sorghum in the linkages of crop rotation under conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince. Methods. Sampling of the soil and plants was carried out according to standard methods; statistical processing of yield data was carried out by the method of variance analysis using a standard method and computer program, thus based on the data obtained, the economic efficiency of the main <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> crops for corn and grain sorghum was determined. Results. Studies (2015 - 2016) showed that the maximum net income was received during the growing season of corn for grain on options using a green mass of planting peas, amaranth, spring rapeseed, and winter wheat straw at the rate of 2 tons per hectare as well as mineral fertilizers of N 150 P 75 K 75 treatment level, thus the net income amounted to 46. 0 - 37. 5 thousand rubles, respectively. While, with the cultivation of grain sorghum, the maximum net income was obtained on the variants of the green mass of amaranth, sowing peas, straw of winter wheat at the rate of 2 tons / ha, mineral fertilizers of N 150 P 75 K 75 treatment level, thus the net income amounted to 58. 9 - 44. 1 thousand. rub. respectively.

40|$|Field {{studies on}} tillage and residue {{management}} for <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> were conducted at two sites, in Tunliu (1987 - 1990), and Shouyang (1992 - 1995) counties of Shanxi province in the semihumid arid regions of northern China. This paper discusses {{the effects of}} different fall tillage (winter fallow tillage) and residue application methods on soil water profile with time and water use, as well as corn yields. Conservation tillage practices for corn in Shouyang resulted in significantly higher soil water contents, especially in the 0 - 100 cm profiles during April-July and September, than under conventional tillage, providing more available water for corn growth due to increased soil water storage during the rainy season. Conservation tillage with residue application practices generally led to yield advantages. Increases of 18 - 26 % were found for reduced tillage with residue incorporation over the conventional systems. Yields under no-till were equivalent to those from conventional methods, especially in dry years. These {{results suggest that the}} following two alternatives -both reducing the number of secondary tillage passes after the main operation for <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> production systems: - using deep ploughing with incorporated straw and fertilizers after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices - using subsoiling between rows or no-till with residue mulching after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices...|$|E
40|$|The water {{constraint}} on agricultural production receives growing {{concern with the}} increasingly sharp contradiction between demand and supply of water resources. How to mitigate and adapt to potential water constraint {{is one of the}} key issues for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable agriculture in the context of climate change. It has been suggested that adjustment and optimization of cropping systems could be an effective measure to improve water management and ensure food security. However, a knowledge gap still exists in how to quantify potential water constraint and how to select appropriate cropping systems. Here, we proposed a concept of water constraint risk and developed an approach for the evaluation of the water constraint risks for agricultural production by performing a case study in Daxing District, Beijing, China. The results show that, over the whole growth period, the order of the water constraint risks of crops from high to low was wheat, rice, broomcorn, foxtail millet, summer soybean, summer peanut, <b>spring</b> <b>corn,</b> and summer corn, and the order of the water constraint risks of the cropping systems from high to low was winter wheat-summer grain crops, rice, broomcorn, foxtail millet, and <b>spring</b> <b>corn.</b> Our results are consistent with the actual evolving process of cropping system. This indicates that our proposed method is practicable to adjust and optimize the cropping systems to mitigate and adapt to potential water risks.

40|$|Transgenic Bt-cotton now {{dominates the}} cotton-growing belt in northwestern China {{where there are}} few natural plant refuges to act as sources of moths {{susceptible}} to Bt toxin. As an initial step towards developing an insect resistance management (IRM) plan for the pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera, on Bt-cotton {{in this part of}} China, we assessed the potential of six crops grown in two configurations to act as refuge hosts for susceptible moth production in both broad-acre and small-holder farms. Egg and larval abundance indicated that H. armigera had a preference for chickpea, pigeon pea, and corn, over cotton, sorghum, and benne (sesame). There {{were no significant differences in}} egg or larval abundance between plot and strip configurations of these crop hosts. We found that sorghum was not attractive to H. armigera, contrary to the findings in other cotton production areas. Moreover, chickpea, pigeon pea, and corn were determined to be potential refuge hosts based on egg and larval abundance over the growing season. From the adult moth population dynamics in broad-acre and small-holder farms, the efficiency of alternative refuge crops, and local agricultural practices, we recommend that <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> be grown as a strip crop as part of an IRM strategy to improve the probability of Bt-susceptible moth production and mating with resistant moths in broad-acre farms.

40|$|The low corn {{price for}} Y 2 K {{combined}} with the recent increases in fertilizer nitrogen prices have caused agronomists, suppliers, and farmers to closely examine the amount of N they will apply this <b>spring.</b> <b>Corn</b> yield variations and differences in yield response to nitrogen fertilizer are primarily {{a function of the}} soil characteristics (depth, drainage, organic matter content, and yield potential) of the environment in which the corn is grown. The response to fertilizer N is also influenced by the amount of available nitrogen from other sources such as residual nitrate-N in the root zone or nitrogen from legumes or manure. These factors are accounted for by the UW soil test recommendations for nitrogen and the recommended adjustments. The combination of these components allows for the estimation of the economically optimum N rate. The very best rate of N to apply is the economic optimum rate because the last unit of N added just pays for itself with additional yield. This rate maximizes the dollar return per acre to the farmer. The other needed components to calculate the optimum N rate is the fertilizer price, the commodity value, and the handling cost of the extra crop yield. These factors are summarized in Table 1 where the quantity of fertilizer N that can be purchased by the net value of a bushel of corn can be derived. This value is called the net corn:N price ratio. Net corn price refers to the market price of corn minus the cost of drying, marketing, handling, etc. If a $ 2. 00 net corn price and $ 0. 20 nitrogen cost is assumed, the resultin...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted {{to aid in the}} integration of crop and livestock systems. A study was initiated to evaluate the impact of <b>spring</b> <b>corn</b> residue grazing and tillage on subsequent crop yields in a corn-soybean rotation. Crop yields were evaluated for two different stocking rates. Normal stocking rates showed no detrimental impacts of grazing or tillage on subsequent crop yields. At higher stocking rates (2. 5 times normal) grazing increased soybean yields. However, corn yields were depressed under no-tillage 2 years post grazing. The results from this study suggest that producers can maintain livestock on crop acres in the spring if soybeans are planted the subsequent growing season. ^ Another study evaluated transgenic (Corn Rootworm protected and Roundup Ready®) corn and non-transgenic corn for residue grazing. Growth performance of steers grazing corn residue from transgenic corn or their respective non-transgenic control was not different. This demonstrates that the feeding value of corn residue does not differ between transgenic corn hybrids and their parental controls. ^ A trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of salt (NaCl) inclusion on animal performance and feed intake. Cattle were individually fed one of five treatments to include increasing levels of NaCl in the supplement from 0 to 0. 5 % of diet DM. Overall, NaCl supplementation was not effective in increasing animal performance or feed intake. Results suggest that NaCl inclusion in diets is not necessary. ^ An experiment was conducted to evaluate pen cleaning frequency and the impact on nitrogen (N) volatilization during summer months and during composting of manure. Either monthly cleaning (MC) or cleaning pens {{at the end of the}} feeding period (EC) were evaluated. Within cleaning frequency, collected manure was composted with and without sawdust amendment. Monthly cleaning was more effective in recovering N in manure and reducing the overall loss from the pen surface than EC. Nitrogen recovery percentages were similar between pen cleaning treatments following composting and additional sawdust amendment was not beneficial. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been great {{interest}} amongst producers to plant cover crops into corn-soybean (Zea mays L. – Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations. Oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (OSR) and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) are two cover crops receiving attention due to nitrogen (N) scavenging abilities. This thesis is comprised of two projects, one focusing on OSR {{and the other on}} cereal rye. The objectives of the one-year OSR study were to repeat a study conducted in 2011 - 2012 to determine effects of OSR and OSR bicultures on inorganic soil-N concentrations with time, depth and distance from the OSR drilled row and on corn productivity. Cover crop treatments included a no cover crop control, OSR alone, OSR/oat (Avena sativa L.), and OSR/rye and were established in fall of 2013 at the Purdue Diagnostic Training Center (DTC) in West Lafayette, Indiana (IN). Bulk soil samples were taken in the fall, and detailed samples with depth and distance from the OSR drilled row were taken in spring on four sampling dates. Cover crop aboveground biomass samples were taken in fall and <b>spring.</b> <b>Corn</b> was established after rye termination and the following measures were taken during corn growth: V 6 tissue samples, stalk nitrate, grain N content, plant populations and yields. Cover crop treatment affected soil NO 3 -N more than soil NH 4 -N. Soil NO 3 -N was highest near the soil surface, closest to the OSR drilled row and generally decreased with depth. Soil NO 3 -N increased with time, whereas soil NH 4 -N peaked by the third sampling. Corn measurements were not affected by cover crop treatment. The Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project (CSCAP) was begun in 2011 with the goal of increasing resiliency of corn-based cropping systems to the stresses of climate variation. The site at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center (SEPAC) in Butlerville, IN consists of four treatments: corn no cover, corn with rye, soybean no cover, and soybean with rye. Data from the first four years of this study are presented. Parameters include: rye dry matter and N accumulation, soil NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N concentrations, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, soil fertility measures, soil aggregate stability, corn grain and stover N and carbon content, corn populations, and cash crop yields. Weather variability impacted cash crop and rye productivity, with decreased yields in 2011 - 2012 due to drought conditions and greater growth and yields in 2013 - 2014. Little rye growth was achieved in fall seasons, but spring growth ranged from 681 - 3102 kg ha- 1 with 22 - 81 kg N ha- 1 in aboveground biomass. Soil NH 4 -N decreased with depth whereas soil NO 3 -N decreased with depth in fall and increased with depth in spring. Soil fertility measures decreased with time at SEPAC regardless of treatment. In 2013, soil aggregate stability in the 0 - 5 cm depth was greater under cereal rye compared to no cover crop. Cash crop yields were unaffected by cover crop treatment. ...|$|E
