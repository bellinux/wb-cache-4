5|$|After {{her husband}} Scott (William Schallert), the marshal of Oracle, Texas, is killed by two assailants, his widow Rose (Beverly Garland) is named {{temporary}} marshal. That night, Rose asks Erica Page (Allison Hayes) to close her saloon at 3 AM {{in accordance with}} town regulations, but Erica insists her saloon is open for business 24 hours. The women fight, but eventually Erica, who loses the fight, closes for the night. After Rose exits, Erica tells lackey Jake (Jonathan Haze) to hire a killer, which he does, finding a man named Cane Miro (John Ireland). As Cane enters town, Rose shoots at him, mistaking him for a man she has been <b>searching</b> <b>out.</b> She apologizes. Cane tells Rose that {{he has come to}} Oracle to see town mayor Gideon Polk (Martin Kingsley).|$|E

Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> truths.|$|E

25|$|From 1863 to 1867 Forest Ranger {{volunteer}} {{units were}} formed, tasked with <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> Maori war parties, acting as scouts, and protecting lines of communication. They arose {{out of the}} need to prevent ambushes and random attacks on civilians near forest areas. The Rangers were well armed and more highly paid. These units used guerrilla style tactics, moving through areas under cover of darkness and ambushing war parties. The Forest Rangers were disbanded on 1 October 1867.|$|E

Making do with what they had was the order of the day, and {{maintenance}} crews were cannibalizing everything in sight {{in order to keep the}} maximum number of F-82s airborne. During the period 26–30 June, the 68th squadron flew 35 combat sorties, averaging five hours per sortie, with the 339th flying similar numbers of missions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s the British hip hop {{seemed to be}} thriving, with flourishing scenes in London, Bristol and Nottingham. British rap became more assured of its identity, abandoning American accents and {{developing}} a more distinctive sound. However, the anticipated mainstream success was not achieved, with the British hip hop scene particularly affected by the record industry clamping down on sampling. The result was {{the development of the}} breakbeat culture, <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> obscure recordings and the creation of original music, with bands like Stereo MCs beginning to playing instruments and sampling their own tunes. Arguably this led to a creative renaissance, with British hip hop shifting from the hardcore American template and moving into more melodic territory.|$|E

Untrained [...] "meerkat actors" [...] play the role of Flower and her family, with the camera crew <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> appropriately-aged meerkats, then following them until the meerkats acted {{in a way that was}} needed for the film.

She did this by <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> unpublished letters and diaries, and by interviewing descendants of Revolutionary era and frontier women, becoming the first historian of the Revolution to carry out such an effort. She noted the [...] "abundance of materials for the [...] history of action" [...] and attempted to add balance by telling the feminine side, referring to the founding [...] "mothers" [...] as giving [...] "nurture in the domestic sanctuary of that love of civil liberty which afterwards kindled into a flame and {{shed light on the}} world".|$|E
500|$|The Pony Express had an {{estimated}} 80 riders who were traveling {{east or west}} along various points of the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied for jobs with the Pony Express, ready to face the dangers and the challenges that sometimes lay along the delivery route. Waddell and Majors could have easily hired them at a much lesser rate, but instead paid them a handsome sum for that time of one hundred dollars a month. Famous American author Mark Twain, who saw the Pony Express in action first hand, described the riders in his travel memoir Roughing It as: [...] "...usually {{a little bit of}} a man". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, their untarnished record proved them to be heroes of the American West for the much needed and dangerous service they provided for the nation. Establishing a complete list of riders is virtually impossible. There was no official list of riders kept by the express company and the scarcity of newspapers along the route contributed to the absence of this information. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the Pony Express was forgotten about almost entirely, and consequently there was not much interest in pursuing and <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> this information for many years following, by which time much of it had simply vanished in the course of everyday affairs. A partial list of riders has been compiled in Raymond and Nancy Settle's 1972 book Saddles & Spurs.|$|E

2500|$|Criticisms of lecture based {{learning}} include {{that students}} get much less interaction with both tutor and colleagues - they passively absorb information in lectures rather than questioning and <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> answers. [...] The lack of interaction also means {{it is harder}} for tutors to know if individual students are struggling as they will only find out if students have not understood the lectures in exams, when arguably it is too late, whereas in problem-based learning, the tutor can assess how much each student is learning based on the student's participation in discussion within the weekly tutorials, and {{may be able to}} help students who are struggling earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gypsy moth}} was {{introduced}} into North America in 1869 from Europe and quickly became an invasive species. [...] Étienne Léopold Trouvelot imported the moths, {{with the intent}} of interbreeding gypsy moths with silk worms to develop a silkworm industry. The moths were accidentally released from his residence in Medford, Massachusetts. There are conflicting reports on the resulting actions. One states that despite issuing oral and written warnings of possible consequences, no officials were willing to assist in <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> and destroying the moths. The other notes that he was aware of the risk and there is no direct evidence that he contacted government officials.|$|E

2500|$|The Italian {{journalist}} Oriana Fallaci, {{citing a}} French priest {{she spoke to}} in Huế, claimed that the death toll of between 5,000 and 8,000 included the deaths due to American bombardment, and at least 200 people, and {{perhaps as many as}} 1,100, who were killed following the liberation of Huế by the US and ARVN forces. Stanley Karnow wrote that the bodies of those executed by South Vietnamese teams were thrown into common graves.

"When we say ... that {{pleasure}} {{is the end}} and aim, we do not mean {{the pleasures of the}} prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, <b>searching</b> <b>out</b> the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul." ...|$|E
