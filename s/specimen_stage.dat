The presented results provide the first comprehensive description of population structure of chaetognaths in the neritic zone west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The studies were performed on samples collected in Admiralty Bay, from December 1994 to June 1995. Following six chaetognath species were determined: Eukrohnia hamata, E. bathypelagica, E. fowleri, Pseudosagitta gazellae, P. maxima and Solidosagitta marri. The representatives of Eukrohnia were observed almost throughout the research period, whereas those of Pseudosagitta and Solidosagitta were found only during first four months of our investigation. Eukrohnia hamata showed a strong dominance in respect to abundance (max. 445 ind. / 1000 m 3). The mean abundance of all taxa significantly fluctuated in the study period and across weeks. Generally, all species were represented by the first three maturity stages (I-III), individuals stage IV occurred sporadically, and mature <b>specimens</b> (<b>stage</b> V) were not recorded at all.

40|$|Direct {{detector}} device (DDD) cameras have revolutionized single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). In {{addition to}} an improved camera detective quantum efficiency, acquisition of DDD movies allows for correction of movement of the specimen, due both to instabilities in the microscope <b>specimen</b> <b>stage</b> and electron beam-induced movement. Unlike <b>specimen</b> <b>stage</b> drift, beam-induced movement is not always homogeneous within an image. Local correlation in the trajectories of nearby particles suggests that beam-induced motion is due to deformation of the ice layer. Algorithms have already been described that can correct movement for large regions of frames and for > 1 MDa protein particles. Another algorithm allows individual < 1 MDa protein particle trajectories to be estimated, but requires rolling averages to be calculated from frames and fits linear trajectories for particles. Here we describe an algorithm that allows for individual < 1 MDa particle images to be aligned without frame averaging or linear trajectories. The algorithm maximizes the overall correlation of the shifted frames with {{the sum of the}} shifted frames. The optimum in this single objective function is found efficiently by making use of analytically calculated derivatives of the function. To smooth estimates of particle trajectories, rapid changes in particle positions between frames are penalized in the objective function and weighted averaging of nearby trajectories ensures local correlation in trajectories. This individual particle motion correction, in combination with weighting of Fourier components to account for increasing radiation damage in later frames, can be used to improve 3 -D maps from single particle cryo-EM.

40|$|Purpose: Identification {{of unique}} {{proteins}} involved in {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP) may facilitate new and more effective diagnostic tools and molecular-based treatments for ROP. Tubedown- 1 (Tbdn- 1), a novel homeostatic protein which copurifies with an acetyltransferase activity, is expressed in normal retinal endothelium and is specifically suppressed in retinal endothelial cells from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, recent in vivo knockdown studies in mice have revealed that Tbdn- 1 is important for retinal blood vessel homeostasis and for preventing retinal neovascularization in adults. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine if the expression pattern of Tbdn- 1 is altered during oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice and in a <b>specimen</b> of <b>stage</b> 3 human ROP. Methods: Specimens of oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice, and a single <b>specimen</b> of active <b>stage</b> 3 ROP were studied by immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis using antibodies raised against Tbdn- 1 and other blood vessel markers. Results: The pattern of Tbdn- 1 expression during the course of oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice suggests a regulating role in neonatal retinopathy. Retinal lesions from oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice display suppression of retinal endothelial Tbdn- 1 protein expression in conjunction with an increase in expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker of proliferation) and α smooth muscle actin (a marker of myofibroblastic cells). Abnormal blood vessels within vitreoretinal neovascular lesions in a human <b>specimen</b> of active <b>stage</b> 3 ROP did not show Tbdn- 1 protein expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that the loss of retinal endothelial Tbdn- 1 expression may be a contributing factor in retinal blood vessel proliferation in ROP...|$|R
