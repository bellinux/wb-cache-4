A medium-term expenditure framework was introduced in the budget formulation for 2006, in line with the strategic development plan established by the Ministry of Finance in 2004. Budget execution is characterised by flexibility in spending, control of the cash flow, the use of regional treasuries for the quarterly appropriations to all budget users, and arrangements for service delivery at the central level partly in regular ministerial departments and partly in public law entities.

40|$|The primary {{mandate of}} a {{national}} Treasury is to promote an optimal financial management of government resources, by ensuring that <b>spending</b> <b>agencies</b> are provided, in a timely manner, the resources needed for a smooth provision of public services, while minimizing the cost of government financing. However, international experience shows that agencies that go by the same name (the Treasury) assume a variety of responsibilities within the gamut of functions encompassed by government financial management. This paper argues that, in countries facing substantial economic and financial adjustment problems and/or rapid institutional change, it is desirable to give the Treasury a broader (rather than narrower) range of responsibilities in government financial management. This is typically the case in economies in transition, in which under central planning Treasury functions were dispersed among different agencies, including the Central Bank. The paper presents {{an overview of the}} main issues governments are likely to face in setting up a national Treasury, in particular in economies in transition. It begins with an analysis of the main Treasury functions. It then discusses the Treasury’s basic organization and structure, information system, and relationships with other public entities. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. That {{there has}} been a {{revolution}} in intergovernmental fiscal relations system is undeniable. The political and constitutional transformation that took place in South Africa has not gone unnoticed in the civil society, and certainly not in the international world affairs. After a period close to a decade of democratic system of governance in South Africa, the time is more than ripe to do a comprehensive review of intergovernmental fiscal relations. Given the variety of demands and pressures on the system, both from policy and from a constitutional point of view, it is important to reflect on the performance of the system in a manner that prepares it for future challenges. Provinces are no longer merely <b>spending</b> <b>agencies</b> for central government. Instead, they have been empowered by the Constitution to fashion their own policy priorities in certain areas and to translate these into resource allocations that will support these policy objectives.

40|$|The {{principal}} proposition {{this paper}} will endeavour to maintain is that the liquidity of the budget is not fully managed by the Ministry of Finance, {{which is why it}} is unable, in collaboration with the Croatian National Bank, to rein in and slow down the growth in short-term public debt. Only since 2001, thanks to institutional improvements, have the conditions been created in the Ministry of Finance for cash and liquidity management. Thus payments operations, previously {{in the hands of a}} government institution, were taken over by the banks; the financial operations of budgetary <b>spending</b> <b>agencies</b> were channelled via the Single Account of the Treasury; and government deposits were gradually transferred from numerous commercial banks to the Single Account of the Treasury in the Croatian National Bank and the state-owned Croatian Postal Bank. Unfortunately, however, the Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Croatian National Bank, still carries out no operation of cash and liquidity management within the government Treasury system, nor does it operate on the money market with its surplus budgetary resources. Because of this state of affairs, management of the cash and liquidity of the central government budget is within the purview of the commercial banks.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} indicates that the availability and quality of public health services varies widely across communities, but relatively {{little is known about the}} factors that give rise to this variation. 1 - 6 One likely source of this variation is governmental spending on public health services. Public health activities in the U. S. are supported through a patchwork of funding streams that vary considerably across states and communities. The most recent national data indicate that local public health <b>agency</b> <b>spending</b> ranged from less than $ 1 per capita to more than $ 200 per capita across communities. 7 Many communities depend heavily on local tax bases to support public health, indicating that economically disadvantaged communities may face considerable challenges in delivering a full array of public health services. Wide disparities in local public health <b>agency</b> <b>spending</b> also suggest that gaps in public health service delivery are likely to exist in communities where spending is limited. Most recently, the economic downturn of 2001 - 03 and the infusion of new federal funding for bioterrorism and emergency preparedness are likely to have precipitated significant changes in local public health <b>agency</b> <b>spending</b> levels and in the allocation of funds across public health activities. 8 We propose to conduct a national, longitudinal study of the causes and consequences of chang...|$|R
