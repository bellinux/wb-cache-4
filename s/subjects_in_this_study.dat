50|$|A 1991 {{study of}} nine female weight-lifters using steroids and seven not using these agents {{has found that}} {{it appears that the}} {{self-administration}} of testosterone and anabolic steroids is increasingly practiced by women in sports where strength and endurance are important. Of the nine anabolic steroid users, seven took multiple anabolic steroids simultaneously. Thirty-fold elevations of serum testosterone were noted in the women injecting testosterone. In three of these women serum testosterone levels exceeded the upper limits for normal male testosterone concentrations. A significant compensatory decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin and a decrease in thyroid-binding proteins were noted in the women steroid users. Also, a 39% decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was noted in the steroid-using weight lifters. Most of the <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> used anabolic steroids continuously, which raises concern about premature atherosclerosis and other disease processes developing in these women.|$|E
50|$|The 206 <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> {{unlike the}} samples of Rubin et al. and East and Rook, were {{typically}} lower class, from neighborhoods with {{high rates of}} delinquency, and exclusively males, who typically have higher rates of problem behaviors than females. These selections served to focus on externalising behaviours typical of aggressive adolescents. Attrition was only 3%, much lower than in Rubin et al.'s study, probably because of the shorter length of the research and the screening out of all families who intended {{to move from the}} area between assessments. The sample was tested both in fourth grade (age 10) and in sixth grade (age 12). Self-selection may still have occurred as in the East and Rook study, with only 74.4% of eligible families agreeing to participate. However, Dishion et al. were able to compare teacher-assessed levels of problem measures among the participating and nonparticipating groups, and found no significant difference.|$|E
50|$|Phonagnosia is the {{auditory}} equivalent of prosopagnosia. Unlike Prosopagnosia, investigations of phonagnosia {{have not been}} extensively pursued. Phonagnosia was first described by a study by Van Lancker and Cantor in 1982. The <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{were asked to identify}} which of four names or faces matched a specific famous voice. The subjects could not complete the task. Since then, there have been a couple studies done on patients with phonagnosia. The clinical and radiologic findings with computerized tomographic scans cat scan in these cases suggest that recognition of familiar voices is impaired by damage to the inferior and parietal regions of the right hemisphere while voice discrimination is impaired by temporal lobe damage of either hemisphere. These studies have also shown evidence for a double dissociation between voice recognition and voice discrimination. Some patients will perform normally on the discrimination tasks but poorly on the recognition tasks; whereas the other patients will perform normally on the recognition tasks but poorly on the discrimination tasks. Patients did not perform poorly on both tasks.|$|E

The brake (figure 6-5). A harness and bungee/tether system was used to simulate body weight by providing forces equivalent to an approximate 1-G body mass. Subjects on this non-motorized treadmill were required to walk and run at a positive percentage grade to overcome mechanical friction. Study participants were familiarized with the LIDO® test protocol and procedures about 30 days before launch (L-30), after which six test sessions were conducted. Three sessions were completed before launch (L-21, L-14 and L-8 days) and three after landing (R+0, R+2 and R+7 to R+10 days).|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{study that}} researched salience {{and public opinion}} examined most of the agenda-setting research since the United States presidential election, 1968 which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to mass media’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main hypothesis {{examined in this study}} is the ranking of certain issues by the media, which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related [...] "to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc." [...] The result of this study concluded that [...] "even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 election, it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or dramatic as some of the other highly salient issues such as drug abuse or environmental pollution. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements." [...] In other words, issues that directly involve <b>subjects,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.|$|E
