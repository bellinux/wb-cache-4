5000|$|The {{other type}} {{consists}} of a chain with slightly larger links and a steel loop (called martin link) at one end. The chain is placed around the detainee's waist and the steel loop is plugged through a chain link. Then, a pair of handcuffs is inserted in the loop and the cuffs are then put on the detainee's wrists; again, the handcuffs should be double locked when applied. The loose end of the belly chain can be secured with a <b>snap</b> <b>hook</b> or a padlock behind the detainee's back. As in this constellation the belly chain cannot be removed unless the handcuffs have been removed first, this type of belly chain does not necessarily need a padlock for fixing. Also, {{the length of the}} chain is designed to fit around the waist of almost every person, including slim and rather stout individuals. For high security transports, the martin link belly chain can be used with security handcuff covers such as the C & S Security Black Box or the CTS Thompson Blue Box. These are hard plastic boxes with a metallic slider and are placed over the handcuffs so that the key holes are hidden by the box. On the one hand, the security cover prevents the detainee from manipulating the keyhole of the handcuffs, for instance if he gets hold of a handcuff key or a lockpick. On the other hand, freedom of movement is further restricted, as the handcuff cover converts standard chain link handcuffs into rigid cuffs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} continuous-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (composite sheets) compared with sheet steel or aluminum {{is that the}} forming process can be integrated directly into the injection molding process. To do so, the composite sheet is heated by contact or infrared heating to a suitable temperature, then formed with the closing stroke of the injection molding tool, and subsequently back molded. In this way {{it is possible to}} achieve a high level of functional integration, because functional elements such as <b>snap</b> <b>hooks</b> and clips can be directly integrated as part of the molded component without the need for any additional process steps after finishing the part. This study investigates the influence of key material properties on the strength of the bond between such a composite sheet and the back-molded thermoplastic component, determined with a peel test...|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, the Cristoforo Colombo carried the Pietà from the Vatican to the 1964 New York Worlds Fair. Pietà was put in a crate that was filled with plastic foam, which was lowered onto a rubber base in the first class pool where the least damage was likely to happen to it. During the actual loading, the Cristoforo Colombo had been put in dry dock {{so that she would}} not move and {{jeopardize}} the crate and its content. Only easily removable <b>snap</b> <b>hooks</b> secured the crate so that it could be released easily in case of accident. In case the Cristoforo Colombo sank during the voyage, the crate had the ability to float. In New York, the crate was lifted by a heavy-lift floating crane onto a barge that was put alongside the ship.|$|R
