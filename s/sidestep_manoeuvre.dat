40|$|The <b>sidestep</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> is {{investigated}} {{in some detail}} for a slender-wing aircraft by specifying the bank-angle time history and determining the required control angles. The effect of inclusion of the full inertia terms, the influence of different bank-angle time histories {{and the consequences of}} wide variations in the aerodynamic derivatives are examined. It is found that {{it is not necessary to}} include the full inertia terms in the equations of,notion. An efficient manoeuvre requires a rapid initial growth of roll angle; if this is not achieved, subsequent control demands are large and only a small sidestep distance is achieved. Besides control effectiveness, the most important derivatives are the yawing moment due to aileron, the rolling moment due to rudder and the yawing moment due to rate of roll. Rudder requirements are much greater than aileron requirements. The initial demands for a good manoeuvre or subsequent demands for a poorly executed manoeuvre could be a design case for the rudder. A tentative design criterion is suggested. If the rudder is not used, the large sideslip angles which develop would require the use of excessively large aileron angles. It appears necessary to attempt some co/ordination of the manoeuvre by the use of the rudder. Piloting difficulties may}~e greatly alleviated by linking the rudder to the aileron...|$|E
40|$|Rugby {{injuries}} are frequent and often severe. Injury to the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) is devastating and can cause serious hardship. Differences between an athlete’s two legs, also known as an asymmetry, can increase injury risk. The question {{of interest in this}} thesis is does lower-extremity symmetry matter for ACL injury risk in male rugby union athletes. A review of the literature describing the aetiology and mechanisms of ACL injuries was performed in conjunction with a pilot investigation analysing rugby match footage to support the rationale of the thesis of investigating the <b>sidestep</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in rugby. An in-depth systematic review and meta-analysis of knee mechanics during sidestepping concluded that weight acceptance is the most important phase to examine abduction moments of the knee when assessing ACL injury risk. A theoretical ACL injury model was conceived from our examination of the <b>sidestep</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in rugby and contained elements of strength, balance and sprint kinetics. Laboratory-based practical assessment tools within our theoretical model were used to evaluate thirty male academy-level rugby athletes. The preferred legs were stronger (ES = 0. 21 – 0. 37), had better balance (ES = 0. 63 – 1. 0), produced greater sprint kinetics (ES = 0. 32 – 0. 67) and experienced a smaller knee abduction moment, a more flexed knee, less trunk lateral flexion and less distance between the centre-of-mass and the ankle-joint-centre while sidestepping (ES = - 0. 26 – - 0. 97) compared to the non-preferred legs. Forwards were stronger (ES = 0. 50 – 0. 66), had worse balance with larger asymmetries (ES = - 0. 66 – - 1. 8) and produced greater sprint kinetics with larger asymmetries (ES = 0. 74 – 0. 81) compared to backs. A hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine the contribution of each leg in determining increased knee abduction moments during sidestepping. While single-leg balance did not contribute to increased ACL injury risk (Ŕ² = < 1 – 4 %), lower-extremity strength and sprint kinetics did (Ŕ² = < 1 – 31 %). The preferred (Ŕ² = 41 %) and non-preferred (Ŕ² = 8 %) legs independently contribute to increased ACL injury risk with unique distributions of strength and sprint kinetics, however these contributions all appear linked with posterior-chain strength. In summary, criterion and practical laboratory-based assessment tools to measure and assess ACL injury risk factors in rugby athletes were identified in this thesis. Assessment tools were used to quantify the differences in strength, balance, sprint kinetics and three-dimensional sidestepping mechanics between the preferred and non-preferred legs and between forwards and backs in amateur academy-level male rugby athletes. Normative values, symmetry angle scores and a discussion of assessment components and training recommendations were provided. A new model and framework for assessing ACL injury risk were outlined to guide the progression of ACL injury prevention strategies in rugby athletes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvre</b> is {{a common}} mecha-nism of noncontact or {{isolated}} ACL ruptures in athletes. We analyzed the amount and direction of tibial rotation that occurred at the knee joint with a triaxial electro-goniometer on 11 male subjects who performed the <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvre.</b> The mean total tibial ro-tation was 19. 84 &plusmn; 5. 63 &deg; and the mean maximum point of internal tibial rotation occurred at 34. 77 &plusmn; 5. 30 % of the stance phase. However, greater values for internal tibial rotation occurred in the swing phase in association with a greater angle of knee flexion. Therefore, in our subjects, during the <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvre,</b> inter-nal tibial rotation did occur at the knee but was not maximal...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A piloted flight {{simulator}} {{study of the}} low speed handling of the BAC 221 slender-wing research aircraft was performed for validation of the simulation of slender-wing supersonic transport aircraft. The lateral representation of the aircraft was satisfactory, and lateral control problems experienced on the real aircraft at high angles of incidence were reproduced on the simulator and investigated in more detail than would be practicable in flight. There were several discrepancies in the longitudinal characteristics of the simulation, some {{of which can be}} attributed to inadequate representation of visual cues: satisfactory explanation of other discrepancies has not yet been obtained but a further simulation may resolve these problems. <b>Sidestep</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> and crosswind landings were studied, and the overall quality of the simulation is discussed in relation to previous supersonic transport aircraft simulations...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} 50 years of space activity, the {{existence}} of space debris and its potential hazards for space vehicles is commonly known to the public. The increasing density of debris parts and their high velocity of more that 7 km/s imply a strong risk for manned and unmanned spacecrafts. Risk mitigation necessitates the exact knowledge of orbital data, which are used for initiating <b>sidestepping</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> of collision-endangered satellites. State-of-the art detection techniques are based on RADAR and passive detection by solar illumination and successive orbit determination. The accuracy for the determination of exact orbital data can be improved strongly when a pulsed laser system is used for illumination and ranging. In general, the accuracy of orbital data extraction is affected by inevitable instabilities of the coarse tracking platform and by omnipresent atmospheric turbulences. In this presentation, we introduce a concept for laser-based space debris monitoring and discuss its benefits vis-à-vis passive optical detection techniques. The actual position of the debris part is determined from angular and distance information, i. e. time of flight measurement of the laser pulses reflected from the debris sample. A high power, repetitive, pulsed laser system is an indispensable component {{that needs to be}} developed for the specific needs of this application...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} sagittal and frontal plane trunk orientation and the most commonly accused attributors to anterior cruciate ligament injury. Twenty-one male (mean age 31 years; height 1. 8 metres; weight 75 kilograms) with at least 10 years soccer experience, participated in this repeated measures study of experimental design. Forty-four reflective markers were attached to specific landmarks to identify the lower limb and trunk segments. Three-Dimensional and force plate data were recorded for 5 successful trials. Participants were instructed to achieve an approach speed of 3 m/s, facilitated by timing gates, complete a right-foot contact on the force plate and execute a <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvre,</b> responding to the movements of the defender. The independent variable tested was trunk orientation (sagittal and frontal plane). Peak values of 7 selected dependent variables were subjected to a two-tailed Spearman’s rho correlation co-efficient test. A bonferroni-corrected p value of 0. 007 was used to denote statistical significance. No significant correlations were found to exist. Certain patterns emerged from the results. Subjects who exhibited knee valgus moments also exhibited a posteriorly directed anterior-posterior ground reaction force, whereas some subjects exhibited an anteriorly directed anterior-posterior ground reaction force and exhibited knee varus loading. The results of this study suggest natural trunk movements during <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvres</b> has no relationship with the selected dependent variables in the confines of this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries {{are the most}} costly injuries in football at both professional and amateur levels (Orchard J, Seward H, McGivern J, Hood S. Intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for anterior {{cruciate ligament}} injury in Australian footballers. Am J Sports Med 2001; 29 : 196 - 200.). In this study video analysis of 34 ACL injuries in Australian football was performed to investigate the causes of these injuries. Factors that {{may have contributed to}} the cause of the injury were analysed, rated and reported. The factors analysed were: type of manoeuvre, direction the knee 'gave way', running speed, knee angle, cutting angle and if the player was accelerating or decelerating. The majority of the injuries analysed occurred in non-contact situations (56 %). Of these 37 % occurred during <b>sidestepping</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> 32 % in landing, 16 % land and step, 10 % stopping/slowing and 5 % crossover cut manoeuvres. Ninety-two percent of the non-contact injuries occurred at extended knee angles of 30 ࠯r less, which is also commonly known to place stress on the ACL and reduce the protective role of hamstrings. Over half (54 %) of non-contact injuries occurred whilst decelerating. It would be expected that greater speed and angle cut too would increase the frequency of ACL injury. The results could not confirm this with most injuries occurring at running speeds of slow jogging to running and equal number of injuries occurred at cutting to angles of the ranges 15 - 45 ࠡnd 45 - 75 ஠These results give greater understanding into potential causes or contributors of ACL injury and information to assist in the development of knee injury prevention programs.

40|$|Purpose Adding {{external}} {{focus of}} attention (EF, focus on the movement effect) may optimize current anterior cruci- ate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programmes. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate the effects of an EF, by a visual stimulus and an internal focus, by a verbal stimulus during unexpected sidestep cutting in female and male athletes and how these effects remained over time. Methods Ninety experienced basketball athletes per- formed <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvres</b> in three sessions (S 1, S 2 and S 3). In this randomized controlled trial, athletes were allocated to three groups: visual (VIS), verbal (VER) and control (CTRL). Kinematics and kinetics were col- lected at the time of peak knee frontal plane moment. Results Males in the VIS group showed a larger ver- tical ground reaction force (S 1 : 25. 4 ± 3. 1 N/kg, S 2 : 25. 8 ± 2. 9 N/kg, S 3 : 25. 2 ± 3. 2 N/kg) and knee flexion moments (S 1 : − 3. 8 ± 0. 9 Nm/kg, S 2 : − 4. 0 ± 1. 2 Nm/ kg, S 3 : − 3. 9 ± 1. 3 Nm/kg) compared to the males in the VER and CTRL groups and to the females in the VIS group (p < 0. 05). Additionally, the males in the VIS group reduced knee valgus moment and the females in the VER group reduced knee varus moment over time (n. s.). Conclusion Male subjects clearly benefit from visual feedback. Females may need different feedback modes to learn a correct movement pattern. Sex-specific learning preferences may have to be acknowledged in day by day practice. Adding video instruction or feedback to regular training regimens when teaching athletes safe movement patterns and providing individual feedback might target suboptimal long-term results and optimize ACL injury pre- vention programmes.

40|$|An {{intervention}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of lower-limb training programs on knee muscle activation patterns and their potential to support the knee load during running and cutting manoeuvres. It is known that balance training can reduce ACL injury but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The effects that strength training has on support for the knee joint during sporting manoeuvres are also not known. Analysis of activation levels and patterns of leg muscles during running, <b>sidestepping</b> and crossover-cutting <b>manoeuvres</b> prior to and following 12 -week training programs revealed important results in terms of potential support of load on the ACL. Balance training increased co-contraction and supportive muscle activation patterns, as did the combination of machine and balance training to a lesser extent. The strength training programs tended to reduce co-contraction and were associated with changes which would lead to less stability of the knee during sporting manoeuvres. It is recommended that balance training should be implemented to reduce an athlete’s risk of ACL injury. KEY WORDS: EMG, sidestepping, activation, balance, strength, prevention, ACL.

40|$|Background: Excessive knee valgus {{moments are}} {{considered}} to be a risk factor for non-contact injuries in female athletes. Knee injuries are highly prevalent in netballers and are significant in terms of cost and disability. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify if changes in external ankle support mechanisms effect the range of motion and loading patterns at the ankle and knee joint during a <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>manoeuvre</b> in high performance netball players. Methods Netballers with no previously diagnosed ankle or knee injury (n = 10) were recruited from NSW Institute of Sport netball programme. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected simultaneously using a 3 -D Motion Analysis System and a force platform to measure ground reaction forces. Players performed repeated side step cutting manoeuvres whilst wearing a standard netball shoe, the same shoe with a lace-up brace and a high-top shoe. Results The brace condition significantly reduced ankle joint ROM in the sagittal plane by 8. 9 ° ± 2. 4 when compared to the standard netball shoe (p = 0. 013). No other significant changes were seen between conditions for either kinematic or kinetic data. All shoe conditions did however produce knee valgus moments throughout the cutting cycle that were greater than those considered excessive in the previous literature (0. 59 Nm / kg-Bwt). Conclusions The results show that an external ankle support brace can be used to reduce the ROM at the ankle in the sagittal plane without affecting the loading of the joints of the lower limb. Internal varus moments generated at the knee during the task were however greater than values reported in the literature to classify excessive knee joint moments, regardless of the condition. All netballers exhibited lower extremity patterns and alignments previously associated with increased peak external valgus moments including; increasing hip abduction, peak hip flexion and internal rotation during early contact and high laterally directed ground reaction forces. Increased external valgus knee loads have been strongly linked to the development of non-contact injuries at the knee in female athletes and could highlight a potential mechanism for the development non-contact knee injuries in netballers performing side step cutting tasks...|$|R
