40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate <b>spray</b> is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the <b>spray</b> pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate <b>spray,</b> which will definitely influence the <b>spray</b> characteristics, such as <b>spray</b> droplet sizes, <b>spray</b> angles, <b>spray</b> droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the <b>spray</b> pressure constant during the process of variable- rate <b>spray</b> has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of <b>spray</b> pressure for variable- rate <b>spray,</b> a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the <b>spray</b> volume was changed by adjusting <b>spray</b> pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The <b>spray</b> features concerning the <b>spray</b> angle and the <b>spray</b> volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input <b>spray</b> pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate <b>spray</b> through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the <b>spray</b> angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles.

The increasing blend ratio of biodiesel brought about a shorter <b>spray</b> tip penetration and a smaller <b>spray</b> angle compared with those of diesel.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improved <b>spray</b> {{deposition}} can {{be attained}} by electrostatically charging <b>spray</b> droplets, {{which increases the}} attraction of droplets to plants and decreases operator exposure to pesticide and losses to the environment. However, this technique alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve desirable penetration of the <b>spray</b> solution into the crop canopy; thus, air assistance can be added to the electrostatic <b>spraying</b> to further improve <b>spray</b> deposition.
