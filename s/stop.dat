5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit <b>stop</b> and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit <b>stop</b> for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit <b>stop</b> three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit <b>stop</b> of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit <b>stop</b> on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit <b>stop</b> and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled <b>stop</b> on lap 44. Fisichella's pit <b>stop</b> was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made a pit <b>stop</b> on lap 30. Hamilton made a pit <b>stop</b> on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final <b>stop</b> of the race. Massa came in for his only <b>stop</b> on lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a pit <b>stop</b> again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E

5|$|The {{depth of}} the first <b>stop</b> is found from the tissue {{compartment}} with the highest partial pressure, {{and the depth of}} first decompression <b>stop</b> is the standard <b>stop</b> depth where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no <b>stop</b> controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk.

5|$|A {{follow-up}} {{study found that}} the optimum duration for the deep safety <b>stop</b> under the experimental conditions was 2.5 minutes, with a shallow safety <b>stop</b> of 3 to 5 minutes. Longer safety stops at either depth did not further reduce PDDB.|$|E
5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit <b>stop</b> on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit <b>stop</b> from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit <b>stop</b> on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit <b>stop</b> from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit <b>stop</b> on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit <b>stop,</b> on lap 33.|$|E
