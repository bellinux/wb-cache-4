In 1951, at about same time as a second storey was added to another vestry {{the opposite side of}} the lobby, funds were raised to convert this chapel into a regimental chapel for the KSLI, resulting in an enlarged apse, new altar, rood <b>screen,</b> <b>rails</b> and chairs. In 1952 and 1966 Regimental colours were laid up here.|$|R

The report reviews current screening programs implemented (or planned) by nine transit agencies, identifying best practices. The authors also discuss why three other transit agencies {{decided not to}} implement passenger screening at this time. The supplement reconfirms earlier conclusions that selective screening is a viable security option, but that effective screening {{must be based on}} clear policies and carefully managed to avoid perceptions of racial or ethnic profiling, and that screening must have public support. The supplement also addresses new developments, such as vapor-wake detection canines, continuing challenges, and areas of debate.

60|$|There hardly stands, as I think, on the earth, a {{building}} more remarkable than the cathedral of Seville, and hardly one more grand. Its enormous size; its gloom and darkness; {{the richness of}} ornamentation in the details, contrasted with the severe simplicity of the larger outlines; the variety of its architecture; the glory of its paintings; and the wondrous splendour of its metallic decoration, its altar-friezes, <b>screens,</b> <b>rails,</b> gates, and the like, render it, to my mind, the first in interest among churches. It has not the coloured glass of Chartres, or the marble glory of Milan, or such a forest of aisles as Antwerp, or so perfect a hue in stone as Westminster, nor in mixed beauty of form and colour does it possess anything equal to the choir of Cologne; but, for combined magnificence and awe-compelling grandeur, I regard it as superior to all other ecclesiastical edifices.|$|R

The exonarthex may have been either open or enclosed, with a door leading to the outside as in the Byzantiine Chora Church.|$|R

The eighteenth century oak pews, the pulpit, <b>screen,</b> communion <b>rails</b> and matching table with barley sugar turned legs, and other woodwork were provided by William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been raised {{in the village of}} Shapwick and whose family lived locally.

50|$|Vestments {{worn by the}} Bishops and Priests at {{this point}} were {{academic}} robes of the educated class. Later, as fashions changed the styles for the clergy remained the same and were embellished. Following the custom of the synagogue, the liturgy was normally sung. Many places divided the congregation into male and female. At some point both Western and Eastern churches adopted the use of curtains to mask the clergy at the altar at certain points; this curtain became the rood <b>screen</b> and altar <b>rails</b> in western churches, and iconostasis in the Byzantine East, while still being used in Armenian and Syriac Churches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} built for the English-speaking {{community}} when the services at St Catherine's were conducted in Welsh. It was designed by the Chester firm of Douglas and Minshull. The foundation stone was laid in 1899 by Mrs Eleanor Frost who also paid {{for many of the}} church furnishings, including the reredos, altar, <b>rails,</b> <b>screen</b> and the pulpit. The tower was added in 1912 after the death of John Douglas, when the firm was known as Douglas, Minshull and Muspratt.

50|$|In {{the century}} {{following}} the English Reformation newly built Anglican churches were invariably fitted with chancel screens, which served {{the purpose of}} differentiating a separate space in the chancel for communicants at Holy Communion, as was required in the newly adopted Book of Common Prayer. In effect, these chancel screens were rood screens without a surmounting loft or crucifix, and examples survive at St John Leeds and at Foremark. New screens were also erected in many medieval churches {{where they had been}} destroyed at the Reformation, as at Cartmel Priory and Abbey Dore. From the early 17th century it became normal for screens or tympanums to carry the Royal Arms of England, good examples of which survive in two of the London churches of Sir Christopher Wren, and also at Derby Cathedral. However, Wren's design for the church of St James, Piccadilly of 1684 dispensed with a chancel <b>screen,</b> retaining only <b>rails</b> around the altar itself, and this auditory church plan was widely adopted as a model for new churches from then on. In the 18th and 19th centuries hundreds of surviving medieval screens were removed altogether; today, in many British churches, the rood stair (which gave access to the rood loft) is often the only remaining trace of the former rood loft and screen.|$|R

New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority has not committed to installing platform screen doors in its subway system, {{though it had been}} considering such an idea since the 1980s. Possible locations for platform doors include several stations along the Second Avenue Subway, but their installation presents substantial technical challenges, as there are different placements of doors on New York City Subway rolling stock. The MTA is also interested in retrofitting platform screen doors on the Canarsie Line, along the , and on the IRT Flushing Line, along the [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} entire New York City Subway system will get retrofitted with platform screen doors or automatic platform gates due to, again, the varying placements of doors on rolling stock.

500|$|The tower ceiling has a tierceron vault and is {{connected}} to the nave and aisles by arches. The nave's arcading spans four bays, the last of which on the north side acts as an entrance to the transept. The north aisle was extended in 1853 by Kirk and Parry, who added a strainer arch to support the tower and join it with the north aisle. The reredos and altar were built in 1922 by L.T. Moore; the rood screen was restored by Ninian Comper in 1918 and the Communion rail was taken from Lincoln Cathedral during a restoration; it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, but Pevsner makes no mention of this. The rood loft is also by Comper, who is described by Simon Jenkins as [...] "inventive as ever. His wood is unusually dark and unpainted, as are the rood figures and angels. The loft blooms out over the crossing." [...] The <b>screen</b> and altar <b>rails</b> in St Hugh's Chapel are the work of C.H. Fowler; E. Stanley Watkins completed the reredos in 1906. In the 1640s, the stained glass included the armorial bearings of Sir William Hussey impaling his wife's Barkley arms, and the arms of Markham and John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln. These have not survived, but the current stained glass includes a [...] "very Gothic" [...] window by Hardman dating to c. 1853, three by Holland of Warwick from the late 1880s, one of Ward and Hughes (1885) and one by Morris & Co. from 1900.
