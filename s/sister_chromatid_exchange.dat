2500|$|Arsenic is {{reported}} to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, micronuclei formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchange</b> and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps mutagenicity of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic genotoxicity is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A [...] mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{genetic damage}} as {{the frequency of}} <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> and micronuclei in lymphocytes of peripheral blood of operating room personnel exposed to waste anaesthetic gases. METHODS: Occupational exposure was measured with a direct reading instrument. Venous blood samples were drawn from 10 non-smokers working {{in the operating room}} and 10 non-smoking controls (matched by age, sex, and smoking habits). Lymphocytes were cultured separately over 72 hours for each assay with standard protocols. At the end of the culture time, the cells were harvested, stained, and coded for blind scoring. The exchanges of DNA material were evaluated by counting the number of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> in 30 metaphases per probe or by counting the frequency of micronuclei in 2000 binucleated cells. Also, the mitotic and proliferative indices were measured. RESULTS: The operating room personnel at the hospital were exposed to an 8 hour time weighted average of 12. 8 ppm nitrous oxide and 5. 3 ppm isoflurane. The mean (SD) frequency of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> was significantly higher (10. 2 (1. 9) v 7. 4 (2. 4)) in exposed workers than controls (p = 0. 036) the proportion of micronuclei (micronuclei/ 500 binucleated cells) was also higher (8. 7 (2. 9) v 6. 8 (2. 5)), but was not significant (p = 0. 10). CONCLUSION: Exposure even to trace concentrations of waste anaesthetic gases may cause dose-dependent genetic damage. Concerning the micronuclei test, no clastogenic potential could be detected after average chronic exposure to waste anaesthetic gas. However, an increased frequency of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> in human lymphocytes could be detected. Although the measured differences were low, they were comparable with smoking 11 - 20 cigarettes a day. Due to these findings, the increased proportion of micronuclei and rates of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> may be relevant long term and need further investigation...|$|R

However, addition of the bifunctional alkylating agent mitomycin C (0. 01 or 0. 03 mug/ml) to the Fanconi's anemia cells during culture induces {{less than half of the}} increase in exchanges found in identically treated normal lymphocytes.

Many of these events occur at sites of incomplete chromatid interchange. The increase in <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> <b>exchanges</b> induced in Fanconi's anemia lymphocytes by the monofunctional alkylating agent ethylmethane sulfonate (0. 25 mg/ml) was slightly less than that in normal cells.
