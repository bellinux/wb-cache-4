These characteristics are important both for ionospheric studies and for terrestrial communication purposes, as they give {{information about the}} <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> <b>communication</b> conditions in the High Frequency (HF) radio spectrum. A RCS- 5 B sweeping HF receiver for oblique sounding was installed at Chania (Crete, Greece, 35. 71 N, 24. 01 E) in April 2005 to perform a radio link with Inskip (UK, 53. 51 N, 2. 51 W). The receiver, able to record the sounding only as a binary file, was not equipped with a tool to display and scale the recorded trace. This work describes software that {{is able to do}} this, consequently increasing the speed of the scaling phase performed by the operator. The usefulness of this software for validating FMUF prediction models is also shown...|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{vertical}} wire {{is the actual}} radiating element, the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power in all azimuthal directions. [...] The axis of the horizontal wire makes little difference. The power is maximum in a horizontal direction or at a shallow elevation angle, decreasing to zero at the zenith. This makes it a good antenna at LF or MF frequencies, which propagate as ground waves with vertical polarization, but it also radiates enough power at higher elevation angles to be useful for <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> ("skip") <b>communication.</b> The effect of poor ground conductivity is generally to tilt the pattern up, with the maximum signal strength at a higher elevation angle.|$|R

For a long period, the sky-wave over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) has {{difficulty}} in detecting ship under {{the background of}} sea clutter, {{and it is difficult}} to apply the existing sea clutter model established in surface wave propagation mode to the sky-wave OTHR sea clutter suppression. Therefore, the difference between surface <b>wave</b> and <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> propagation mode is analyzed firstly, then the scope of grazing angle about <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> beam is calculated, finally the backscattering coefficients of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from sea surface are derived by perturbation method and the backscattering mechanisms of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from sea surface are analyzed.

Considering the spatial distribution characteristics of OAM beams, a new OAM spatial modulation (OAM-SM) millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>communication</b> system is first proposed for future mobile networks. Furthermore, the capacity, average bit error probability and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>communication</b> systems are analytically derived for performance analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a possible}} explanation {{for some of the}} time variations of the night-time <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> at distances between 80 and 160 km from low-medium-frequency transmitters. In the postulated model this variation is explained in terms of interference between the signals travelling along many paths from the transmitter to the receiver via a lower ionosphere disturbed by the passage of a ducted acoustic wave. A rigorous solution to this model is not possible, but by using reasonable approximations a solution is obtained which is suitable for analysing experimental records of <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> variations. These experimental records were obtained by using an interferometer technique to separate the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from the ground wave. Some extremely good agreement was found between theory and experiment showing that this could be a useful technique for studying ducted acoustic waves. Certainly some, at least, of the variations commonly observed in the night-time <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> signal are caused in this way...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} ray {{theory and}} transfer matrix method-based {{model for a}} lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP) propagating in Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG) is proposed and tested. The model involves the presentation of a lightning source, parameterization of the lower ionosphere, derivation of a transfer function representing all effects of EIWG on LEMP <b>sky</b> <b>wave,</b> and determination of attenuation mode of the LEMP ground wave. The lightning source is simplified as an electric point dipole standing on Earth surface with finite conductance. The transfer function for the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> is derived based on ray theory and transfer matrix method. The attenuation mode for the ground wave is solved from Fock's diffraction equations. The model is then applied to several lightning sferics observed in central China during day and night times within 1000 km. The {{results show that the}} model can precisely predict the time domain <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> for all these observed lightning sferics. Both simulations and observations show that the lightning sferics in nighttime has a more complicated waveform than in daytime. Particularly, when a LEMP propagates from east to west (Phi = 270 degrees) and in nighttime, its <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> tends to be a double-peak waveform (dispersed <b>sky</b> <b>wave)</b> rather than a single peak one. Such a dispersed <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> in nighttime may be attributed to the magneto-ionic splitting phenomenon in the lower ionosphere. The model provides us an efficient way for retrieving the electron density profile of the lower ionosphere and hence to monitor its spatial and temporal variations via lightning sferics.

The monthly averaged electric fields were depicted on the complex plane for typical summer and winter months, June and November. The locus traced out by the electric field vector during daytime is nearly circular. This is because during daytime the amplitude of the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> remains nearly constant while its phase changes {{in accord with the}} height change of the reflection layer, and thus the electric field vector traces out a circular locus with its center {{at the tip of the}} supposed ground wave vector. The locus has a loop during the sunrise or sunset period, which seems to arise from interference of two waves reflected by two different layers. In June the amplitude of the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> decreases rapidly before the dawn or increases after the dusk. In November such rapid change is not observed. During nighttime, the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> phase changes in such a way as to suggest that the reflection height moves upwards with time before midnight or lowers after midnight in November. In June it changes similarly before midnight, but after midnight it varies erratically. These characteristics are closely related to the structure of the D region, which is clearly shown by simulating the loci traced out by electric fields...|$|R

40|$|The {{signals from}} VLF/LF {{transmitters}} {{are known to}} propagate in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, so that the subionospheric propagation characteristics {{are very sensitive to}} the condition of the lower ionosphere. We know that there appear the terminator times just around the sunrise and sunset in the diurnal variation of subionospheric VLF/LF signal (amplitude and phase). These terminator times are found to shift significantly just around an earthquake, which enables us to infer the change in the ionosphere during the earthquake. In this paper we try to understand the physical mechanism on the generation of those terminator times for relatively short propagation path (less than 2000 km) by means of wave-hop method. It is found that the lowering of the ionosphere boundary during an earthquake decreases the path length of the <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> and this alters the interference condition of this wave with the ground wave, which lead to an appearance of terminator times as the destructive interference between the ground and <b>sky</b> <b>waves.</b> Finally, we suggest a possible use of terminator time shifts to investigate the lower ionospheric plasma changes during the earthquakes...|$|R

For the present study, the LF radio data collected over about two years were analysed. At first, the day-time data and the night-time data were separated for each radio signal. Taking into account that the LF signals are characterized by ground-wave and sky-wave propagation modes, the day-time data are related to the ground wave and the night-time data to the <b>sky</b> <b>wave.</b> In this framework, the effects of solar activity and storm activity were defined in the different trends.
