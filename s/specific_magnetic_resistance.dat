Background. For thin metal {{coatings}} indirect {{determination of}} mechanical properties is an actual task. Its accom-plishing requires establishing the dependencies between {{different groups of}} coatings properties. Objective. The aim of research is identification of the dependence between characteristics of mechanical and magnetic properties of thin electrodeposited coatings, particularly ? the iron-based alloys. Methods. 50 ?m thick Fe-Cr and Fe-Ni alloys obtained at the temperature of 55 ?C and the cathode current density of 10 A/dm? from the sulphate electrolytes, containing iron ions (80 g/l) and chromium or nickel ions (from 1 to 40 g/l), have been investigated with definition of microhardness, <b>magnetic</b> <b>resistance,</b> surface morphology, phase composition and preferred crystal orientations. Results. The dependencies of microhardness and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resistance</b> of the Fe-Cr and Fe-Ni alloys on the concentration of the alloying elements in the electrolyte have common non-linear nature and correlate well {{with the results of}} precise measurement of the spacing of crystal lattice of the alloys. At that, the content of chromium and nickel in the coatings is not significant impact factor on the properties. Conclusions. The found identical character of microhardness change and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resistance</b> of the alloys indicates significant influence of residual macrostrain on mechanical and magnetic properties of Fe-Cr and Fe-Ni alloys. The reason for non-linear changes in macrostrain in the investigated alloys are the features of structure formation, which can be observed in the formation of surface morphology and preferred crystal orientations. ????????????. ??? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ???????, ??????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ???????????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ????????. ???? ????????????. ????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ??????? ?????? ????????????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????. ???????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????
