40|$|Overt {{academic}} behaviors, such as {{problem solving}} strategies, attention skills, and motivation, are key, instructional targets considered to contribute both to {{present and future}} progress (Barnett, 1996; McKinney, 1975). <b>The</b> assessment <b>of</b> student behaviors through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> behavior rating scales is prevalent in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> education. With <b>the</b> link between learning behaviors and achievement and <b>the</b> widespread use <b>of</b> behavior ratings scales, the need for valid, standardized rating scales that focus on observable and potentially alterable learning behaviors is evident. One such measure is the Learning Behaviors Scale (LBS; McDermott, Green, Francis, 2 ̆ 6 Stott, 1999). In light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS, the present study explored <b>the</b> constructs <b>of</b> attention, problem solving, and motivation with the following tasks used as standards for comparison: <b>the</b> Attention/Persistence <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS with the Trail Making Test (TMT; Reitan 2 ̆ 6 Wolfson, 1985); <b>the</b> Attention/Persistence <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS with the Digit Span subtest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991); <b>the</b> Strategy/Flexibility <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS with <b>the</b> Mazes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WISC-III (Wechsler, 1991); <b>the</b> Strategy/Flexibility <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS with <b>the</b> Matrices subtest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Differential Abilities Scale (Elliott, 1990); <b>the</b> Motivation <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBS with <b>the</b> General <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Children 2 ̆ 7 s Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Gottfried, 1985). Teachers rated student learning behaviors with the 29 -item LBS. Teacher-assigned grades and standardized achievement scores served as achievement criterions. The participant sample (N = 141) consisted of students from two schools in southeastern Pennsylvania. Although the results failed to support the proposed hypotheses, a number <b>of</b> factors influenced <b>the</b> study: a contextual impact on <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TMT, <b>the</b> construct validity <b>of</b> intelligence scale subtests, and variance due to <b>the</b> different sources <b>of</b> information gathered in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|Perfectionism is a {{construct}} only recently operationalized in the literature, with need identified in discovering {{its relationship to}} attachment style and patterns of adjustment in college. The first hypothesis was that a positive correlation would be evidenced between insecure attachment style and maladaptive perfectionism. The second hypothesis predicted {{that the relationship between}} maladaptive perfectionism and adjustment would be weaker for students with insecure attachment styles than those with a secure attachment style. Participants were 64 first-year undergraduate students from Pacific University and Reed College. Self-report measures used to measure the variables were the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), Experiences in Close Relationship Scale (ECR), and Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ). A Pearson product-moment correlational analysis was utilized to determine the strength and direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships between <b>subscales.</b> Findings indicated that the first hypothesis was supported, as a positive correlation was found between the Doubts about Actions <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MPS and <b>the</b> Attachment Avoidance <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ECR. The second hypothesis was unsupported, as a positive correlation was found between <b>the</b> Parental Criticism <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MPS and the Personal Emotional Attachment <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SACQ.

50|$|One way {{in which}} the QWB and the QWB-SA has been {{utilized}} is that it has been a comparator used to validate other measures, or a starting point for creating <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire.

50|$|Another {{potential}} {{reason for}} the inconsistency in these findings is {{that the number of}} items in the original scale is insufficient. Normally, three or more “strongly loaded” items (i.e. items that carry a lot of statistical weight or importance) are needed to ensure the reliability of these factors. The 25 item CD-RISC does not always stick to these guidelines. For example, Factor 5 (spiritual influences) only has two items that support it. Because of the discrepancies in these findings surrounding factor structure, the <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original CD-RISC are not recommended to be used alone.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} {{difference is that}} the Canadian definition excludes patients with symptoms of mental illness. It was updated in 2010 to provide greater specification to the original.

50|$|When {{administered}} to a test population, women {{scored higher on}} fluidity, attitude-behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no significant gender differences in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister’s hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, the <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity {{is a much more}} complicated construct than initially imagined.|$|E

The data {{were used to assess}} test-retest reliability (ICC) and smallest detectable change (SDC, based on <b>the</b> standard error <b>of</b> measurement (SEM)). To assess responsiveness, changes in scores between baseline and the 3 month follow-up were related to an external criterion to estimate the minimal important change (MIC). We calculated the group size needed to detect the MIC beyond measurement error. Results The ICC for the Symptom Severity Scale was 0. 68 (95 % CI: 0. 54 – 0. 78). The SDC was 1. 00 at individual level and 0. 11 at group level, both on a 5 -point scale. The MIC was 0. 23, exceeding the SDC at group level. The group size required to detect a MIC beyond measurement error was 19 for the Symptom Severity Scale. The ICC for the hand and finger function <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch-AIMS 2 was 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 47 – 0. 74).

50|$|Considerable {{evidence}} indicates {{a prominent role}} for trauma-related cognitions {{in the development and}} maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized regression analysis to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> {{cognitive}} model <b>of</b> depression postulates that the latent dysfunctional cognitive structure {{serves as a}} vulnerability factor in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> depression. This study examines the relation between two cognitive processes (dysfunctional attitudes and perfectionism) and depressive symptoms {{and quality of life}} among Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Method: The 146 respondents were recruited from the community in Hong Kong who were potential participants for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We use <b>the</b> Chinese versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beck Depression Inventory (C-BDI) and the Almost Perfect Scale (revised version; C-APS-R) to measure <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> depression and <b>the</b> perfectionist attitudes. We use <b>the</b> Chinese versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quality <b>of</b> Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (C-Q-LES) and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (C-DAS) to measure <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> life satisfaction and dysfunctional beliefs. We hypothesize that while C-DAS, C-APS-R, and their subscales would significantly predict C-BDI, these variables would inversely predict C-Q-LES in this study. We employ one-way analyses of variance, a cluster analysis, and separate hierarchical regression analyses to explore the relation among the variables. Results: The results show that <b>the</b> discrepancy <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> C-APS-R and <b>the</b> C-DAS significantly predict the C-BDI and <b>the</b> leisure activity <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-Q-LES. Significant predictions are also found in <b>the</b> high standards <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-APS, C-DAS, and C-BDI and in <b>the</b> social relationships <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-Q-LES. Finally, the maladaptive perfectionists in the study have significantly higher scores in the C-DAS and C-BDI than had the adaptive perfectionists. Conclusions: This study fills a research gap by identifying the relations among perfectionism, dysfunctional attitudes, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in Chinese adults in Hong Kong. © 2011 M.
