5|$|Boron nitride (along with <b>Si3N4,</b> NbN, and BNC) is {{reported}} to show weak fibrogenic activity, and to cause pneumoconiosis when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10mg/m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.|$|E
5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (<b>Si3N4)</b> and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E

25|$|Silicon nitride, <b>Si3N4,</b> can {{be formed}} by {{directly}} reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300°C, {{but a more}} economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500°C. It would make a promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it: it is chemically near-totally inert, and even above 1000°C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the Mohs hardness scale), dissociates only at 1900°C at 1atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185g/cm3), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be2SiO4). A similar refractory material is Si2N2O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450°C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si–O–Si linkages to each other.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and <b>Si3N4.</b> Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E
500|$|The first {{preparation}} {{was reported}} in 1857 by Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Friedrich Wöhler. [...] In their method, silicon was heated in a crucible placed inside another crucible packed with carbon to reduce permeation of oxygen to the inner crucible. [...] They reported a product they termed silicon nitride but without specifying its chemical composition. [...] Paul Schuetzenberger first reported a product with {{the composition of the}} tetranitride, [...] , in 1879 that was obtained by heating silicon with brasque (a paste made by mixing charcoal, coal, or coke with clay which is then used to line crucibles) in a blast furnace. [...] In 1910, Ludwig Weiss and Theodor Engelhardt heated silicon under pure nitrogen to produce [...] E. Friederich and L. Sittig made <b>Si3N4</b> in 1925 via carbothermal reduction under nitrogen, that is, by heating silica, carbon, and nitrogen at 1250–1300°C.|$|E
500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (<b>Si3N4),</b> or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{its close}} {{similarity}} to silicon tetrachloride, {{there are few}} applications unique to SiBr4.

Pyrolysis of SiBr4 followed by treatment with ammonia yields silicon nitride (<b>Si3N4)</b> coatings, a hard compound used for ceramics, sealants, and the production of many cutting tools.|$|E

50|$|Silicon nitride (<b>Si3N4)</b> is {{a ceramic}} with many {{commercial}} high-temperature {{applications such as}} engine parts. It can be synthesized from the elements at temperatures between 1300 and 1400 °C. Three different crystallographic forms exist. Other binary silicon nitrogen compounds have been proposed (SiN, Si2N3, Si3N) and other SiN compounds have been investigated at cryogenic temperatures (SiN2, Si(N2)2, SiNNSi).

50|$|The {{structure}} of beta carbon nitride (β-C3N4) was first proposed by Marvin Cohen and Amy Liu in 1989. It is isostructural with <b>Si3N4</b> and was predicted {{to be harder}} than diamond. The calculated bond length was 1.47 Å, 5% shorter than the C-C bond length in diamond. Later calculations indicated that the shear modulus is 60% of that of diamond, and carbon nitride is less hard than c-BN.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2, is a nitride of beryllium. It can be {{prepared}} from the elements at high temperature (1100-1500 °C), unlike Beryllium azide or BeN6, it decomposes in vacuum into beryllium and nitrogen.

Within the probe structure, the cantilever and tip material may not be same. Tips are usually manufactured using anisotropic etching or vapor deposition. The probe is placed at an angle around 11-15 degrees from the horizontal axis.|$|E
50|$|Generally SONOS is {{very similar}} to {{standard}} double polysilicon flash, but hypothetically offers higher quality storage. This is due to the smooth homogeneity of the <b>Si3N4</b> film compared with polycrystalline film which has tiny irregularities. Flash requires the construction of a very high-performance insulating barrier on the gate leads of its transistors, often requiring as many as nine different steps, whereas the oxide layering in SONOS can be more easily produced on existing lines and more easily combined with CMOS logic.|$|E
50|$|Buffered {{oxide etch}} (BOE), {{also known as}} {{buffered}} HF or BHF, is a wet etchant used in microfabrication. Its primary use is in etching thin films of silicon dioxide (SiO2) or silicon nitride (<b>Si3N4).</b> It {{is a mixture of}} a buffering agent, such as ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and hydrofluoric acid (HF). Concentrated HF (typically 49% HF in water) etches silicon dioxide too quickly for good process control and also peels photoresist used in lithographic patterning. Buffered oxide etch is commonly used for more controllable etching.|$|E
