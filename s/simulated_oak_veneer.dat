40|$|Using {{written and}} studio {{research}}, the above research question is interrogated through {{a body of}} practical work, that evolved into a static exhibition titled Second skin: new knitting at The Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Paddington, New South Wales, Australia, in January/February 2008. This thesis examines knitting {{as a form of}} constructed textile in an historical and contemporary context and explores the integral relationship it has with fashion and textiles, as well as questioning the significance of interplay between fashion and art. The primary aim of this research is to explore contemporary knitwear designers working in the high-fashion&# 146; area of design and investigate how they are challenging traditionally established rules and perceptions, and potentially blur the boundaries of what is considered fashion design, into art. While conceptual fashion design has always been a debateable issue among fashion scholars as to whether it can be viewed as fashion, antifashion or possibly art, this thesis examines the influences of modernity and deconstruction in relation to knitting, to establish a conclusion regarding the contemporary position and understanding of knitting in society at present. Through gathering both primary and secondary research nationally and internationally, knitting has been examined in relation {{to the ways in which}} contemporary designers working in the realm of knitting are unravelling these traditionally based preconceptions, and analysing what they are accomplishing through the use of mixed media applications, post-knitting treatments, yarn and stitch manipulation, and challenging sculptural form to create a new visual language through artisanal production. The body of work presented explores the concepts established in the written research relative to perception and deconstruction, and provokes questions which challenge the notion of knitting as fashion, art or both.

Numerous {{studies have examined the}} impact of individual factors (like seed predation) on the oak regeneration process, but less information is available on the relative and combined impacts of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors on early oak life history. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit model to <b>Simulate</b> <b>Oak</b> Early Life history (SOEL). The model connects acorn survival, acorn dispersal, germination, seedling growth, and seedling survival submodels based on empirical data with an existing gap model (JABOWA). Using SOEL, we assessed the sensitivity of several metrics of oak regeneration to different parameters associated with early oak life history. We also applied the model in three individual case studies to assess: (1) how variable acorn production interacts with timing of timber harvest; (2) the effect of shelterwood harvest-induced differences on seed predation; and (3) the consequences of interactions between drought, seedling growth and survival, and timber harvest. We found that oak regeneration metrics including percent emergence, seedling density, and sapling density were most sensitive to the amount of acorn production, acorn caching probability by scatterhoarders, and seedling growth rates. In the case studies, we found that timing harvest to follow large acorn crops can increase the density of oak regeneration in the short term following harvest, at least under some conditions. Following midstory removal, lower weevil infestation probability and lower post-dispersal acorn survival resulted in a modest decline in seedling density, but the decline did not persist to the sapling life stage class. Drought frequency had a powerful negative impact on both growth and survival for individual seedlings, which resulted in large reductions in both seedling and sapling density.

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{understanding}} future {{spatial and}} temporal distributions of tree species in the Mediterranean region of France under various climates. We focused on two different species (Pinus Halepensis and Quercus Ilex) and compared their growth under the IPCC-B 2 climate scenario in order to quantify significant changes between present and future. The influence of environmental factors such as atmospheric CO 2 increase and topography on the tree growth has also been quantified. We modeled species growth {{with the help of}} a process-based model (MAIDEN), previously calibrated over measured ecophysiological and dendrochronological series with a Bayesian scheme. The model was fed with the ARPEGE - MeteoFrance climate model, combined with an explicit increase in CO 2 atmospheric concentration. The main output of the model gives the carbon allocation in boles and thus tree production. Our results show that the MAIDEN model is correctly able to <b>simulate</b> pine and <b>oak</b> production in space and time, after detailed calibration and validation stages. Yet, these simulations, mainly based on climate, are indicative and not predictive. The comparison of simulated growth at end of 20 th and 21 st centuries, show a shift of the pine production optimum from about 650 to 950 m due to 2. 5 K temperature increase, while no optimum has been found for oak. With the direct effect of CO 2 increase taken into account, both species show a significant increase in productivity (+ 26 and + 43 % for pine and oak respectively) at the end of the 21 st century.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{winemaking}} process involves different complex {{chemical and}} biochemical reactions, which include those of oxygen (O 2). Oxygen can {{come into contact}} with the wine through various winemaking procedures and can be used by the winemaker to enhance the quality of red wine. In wine, the main substrates for oxidation are phenolic molecules, which form quinones. These can influence the sensory characteristics of the wine. O 2 can be used in fresh must to remove oxidisable phenolic molecules through a process called hyper-oxidation and can also be added to fermenting must to enhance the fermentation performance of yeast. Controlled O 2 additions during ageing can lead to the wine’s colour being increased and the astringency of the wine decreased. This is due to the formation of acetaldehyde from the oxidation of ethanol, which induces the polymerisation of tannin and anthocyanin molecules. The addition of too much O 2 to wine can, however, lead to unwanted over-oxidation, with certain off-odours being formed. It can also enhance the growth of unwanted spoilage microorganisms, such as Brettanomyces and acetic acid bacteria. Although research on O 2 in wine was started many years ago, many questions still remain. These include the general effect of O 2 on the sensory and phenolic profile of red wine especially and the microbiology of wine during ageing. An effective way of measuring oxidation, especially in red wine must also be developed. In {{the first part of this}} study, the effects of O 2 and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) additions on a strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis (also known as Dekkera bruxellensis) and Acetobacter pasteurianus were investigated. Epifluorescence microscopy and plating revealed that the A. pasteurianus strain went into a viable but non-culturable state in the wine after prolonged storage under relative anaerobic conditions. This state, however, could be negated with successive increases in culturability by the addition of O 2, as would happen during the transfer of wine when air is introduced. The A. pasteurianus strain was also relatively resistant to SO 2, but the B. bruxellensis strain was more sensitive to SO 2. A short exposure time to molecular SO 2 drastically decreased the culturability of the B. bruxellensis strain, but bound SO 2 had no effect on the culturability or viability of either of the two types of microorganisms. Oxygen addition to the B. bruxellensis strain also led to a drastic increase in viability and culturability. It is thus clear that SO 2 and O 2 management in the cellar is of critical importance for the winemaker to produce wines that have not been spoiled by Brettanomyces or acetic acid bacteria. This study should contribute to the understanding of the factors responsible for the growth and survival of Brettanomyces and acetic acid bacteria in wine, but it should be kept in mind that only one strain of each microorganism was used. This should be expanded in future to include more strains that occur in wine. The second part of this study investigated the effect of micro-oxygenation on four different South African red wines. It was found that the micro-oxygenation led to an increase in the colour density and SO 2 resistant pigments of the two wines in which micro-oxygenation was started just after the completion of malolactic fermentation. In one of these wines, a tasting panel preferred the micro-oxygenation treated wines to the control. In the other two red wines, in which the micro-oxygenation was started seven months after the completion of malolactic fermentation, very little colour increase was observed. One of these two wines was also matured in an oak barrel, where the change in phenolic composition was on par with the treated wines. A prolonged period of micro-oxygenation, however, led to this wine obtaining an oxidised, over-aged character. Micro-oxygenation and maturation in an oak barrel also enhanced the survival of acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces in this wine. Micro-oxygenation can hence be used by the wine producer on young red wines to enhance the quality of the wine, but should be applied with care in older red wines. Future research into micro-oxygenation should focus on whether it can <b>simulate</b> an <b>oak</b> barrel. More research into the effect of micro-oxygenation on the sensory profile of the wine is needed. As mentioned, the addition of O 2 can lead to oxidative degradation of wine. The brown colour in wine is often used as an indication of oxidation, but oxidative aromas can be perceived before a drastic increase in the brown colour has been observed in red wine. The third part of this study was to assess the possible use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to measure the progression of oxidation in Pinotage red wines. Three wines were used in this study and clear separation between the control and aerated wines was observed by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Sensory analysis of these wines confirmed this observation, with a reduction especially in berry fruit and coffee characters and an increase first in potato skin and then acetaldehyde aroma characters as the oxidation progressed. PCA analysis also revealed that in certain wines the visible spectrum of light did not indicate the progression of oxidation as sensitively as with the use of FTIR. This also correlated with the inability of the panel to observe a drastic colour change. FTIR should be further investigated as a possible means of monitoring oxidation in wine and this study should be expanded to wines made from other cultivars as well...|$|R
