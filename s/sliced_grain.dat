40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the significant impact of Cr on the electronic conductivity of a LaNi 0. 6 Fe 0. 4 O 3 (LNF) porous cathode layer at 800 °C. Vapor transport of Cr-species, originating from a porous metallic foam, and subsequent reaction with LNF, {{results in a}} decrease of the electronic conductivity of the LNF-layer. Cr has been detected throughout the entire cross-section of a 16 μm thick LNF layer, while Ni, besides its compositional distribution in the LNF layer, has also been found in enriched spots forming Ni-rich metal oxide crystals. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Cr is gradually incorporated into the LNF-grains, while Ni is proportionally expelled. Electron diffraction performed {{in the center of}} a <b>sliced</b> <b>grain</b> showed the initial rhombohedral crystal structure of LNF, whereas diffraction performed close to the edge of the grain revealed the orthorhombic perovskite crystal structure, indicating a Cr-enriched perovskite phase. Progressive Cr deposition and penetration into the LNF grains and necks explains the electronic conductivity deterioration. The impact of Cr-poisoning on the electronic conductivity of the LNF porous layer is considerably smaller at 600 °C than at 800 °C...|$|E
40|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the properties of}} Ni-W alloy, dimethylamine borane (DMAB) was added to an alloy Ni-W electrolyte solution and a ternary Ni-W-B alloy was electrodeposited. The electrodeposition, crystallographic structure, surface morphology, heat treatment and corrosion resistance, of the alloy were studied by DSC, XRD, SEM and electrochemical techniques. The {{results showed that the}} structure of the alloy was greatly affected by the cooperation of boron compound. DSC experiment combined with X-ray diffractometry indicated that the obtained Ni-W-B alloy was still in amorphous structure although W content in the alloy was decreased by the addition of DMAB. After heat treatment at 400 degrees C for 1 h, the microhardness was increased from 612 to 947 kg*mm(- 2) that was comparative to Cr coating. The appearance of the as-plated coating was in fine and <b>slice</b> <b>grains</b> and kept almost no change after heat treatment.

40|$|Nutrients {{required}} {{for the growth of}} the embryo and endosperm of developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains are released into the endosperm cavity from the maternal tissues across the nucellar cell plasma membranes. We followed the uptake and efflux of sugars {{into and out of the}} nucellus by <b>slicing</b> <b>grains</b> longitudinally through the endosperm cavity to expose the nucellar surface to experimental solutions. Sucrose uptake and efflux are passive processes. Neither was sensitive to metabolic inhibitors, pH, or potassium concentration. p-Chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, however, strongly inhibited both uptake and efflux, although not equally. Except for p-chloromercuribenzene sensitivity, these characteristics of efflux and the insensitivity of Suc movement to turgor pressure are similar to those of sucrose release from maize pedicels, but they contrast with legume seed coats. Although the evidence is incomplete, movement appears to be carrier mediated rather than channel mediated. In vitro rates of sucrose efflux were similar to or somewhat less than in vivo rates, suggesting that transport across the nucellar cell membranes could be a factor in the control of assimilate import into the grain...|$|R

40|$|A {{particle}} swarm/pattern search hybrid optimizer {{was used}} to drive a solid rocket motor modeling code to an optimal solution. The solid motor code models tapered motor geometries using analytical burn back methods by <b>slicing</b> the <b>grain</b> into thin sections along the axial direction.

The hybrid approach to optimization is capable of exploring {{large areas of the}} solution space through particle swarming, but is also able to climb “hills” of optimality through gradient based pattern searching. A preliminary method for designing tapered internal geometry as well as tapered outer mold-line geometry is presented. A total of four optimization cases were performed.

40|$|AbstractA {{grinding}} process model {{based on a}} kinematic modeling approach is presented. A unique experimental set-up is designed for validation purposes allowing table feed rates of up to 480 m/min. Modeling and experimental verifications are carried out under dry grinding conditions. Separating active and non-active grains during grinding can be controlled by depth of cut. Four basic grain types, such as cuboids, triangle prisms, triangular pyramid variants and dodecahedrons, are used for grain generation. New cutting edges can be generated by <b>slicing</b> the <b>grain</b> edges and corners by variable fracture plane rotation and distance variation to the origin. Consequently, {{more than one million}} grain shapes are possible for the cuboid. Grinding grains are placed on the grinding wheel referential plane. The orthogonal cross-sectional cutting line of each grain is extracted and brought into contact with the workpiece. A triangular distribution for grain protrusion is employed.

The analyses by X-ray Diffraction show that the analyzed samples constituted mainly of kaolin with similar content, of Mica (Muscovite-Illite), as well as of Quartz in heavy proportion in the two samples (IK and WK). The existence of some elements as the Goethite and Hematite, as well as the Anatase and the Rutile, generate the disorder in the chemical composition of the Kaolinite. These modifications of structural order are for consequence of change of the quality raw materials of the kaolin extracted from the Tamazert deposit. We remark that these variations are more important for the Iron Kaolin (IK); they are explaining by the presence of more elevated content in silica. However, the increase of these contents is less important for White Kaolin (WK) ...|$|R

40|$|Machinability Variations in Alloy 718 Turbine Components PAJAZIT AVDOVIC Department of Materials and Manufacturing Technology Chalmers University of Technology Abstract Alloy 718 has a {{reputation}} for being very troublesome during the cutting process. It was suspected that this material was too hard and having too fine grain size and that these characteristics caused damage to cutting tools during processing. Sometimes it was difficult to machine in different regions in the same detail. In some cases it was possible to machine some discs without any problems whilst {{at the same time a}} number of discs were very difficult to treat. For Alloy 718 machined with Al 2 O 3 SiCW ceramic tools the main types of wear are mainly notch wear, flank wear and top slice wear. From retrieving spent round C 670 tools in production, it was found that an optimum effective cutting angle range existed in terms of insert wear. This means that if the effective cutting edge length is controlled through programming for each feed rate lower wear rates should be obtained. To study the influence of different grain sizes, Alloy 718 work-piece material was heat treated. The results showed that the limiting wear type is the notch wear that occurred at the end of depth of cut, but that, no valid difference between rings with small (ASTM 8) and large grain sizes (ASTM 3. 5) in terms of flank wear or notch depth were observed. However, burr formation was observed for both materials, but of different appearance depending primarily on grain size. The large grain size gave burr formation on the surface perpendicular to the cut surface, while the small grain size gave burr formation on the cut surface. Moreover, the wear characteristics and type of burr were accordingly obtained for the material with smaller grain size (ASTM 8) as in production with the same grain size. The implication of these results is that it may be possible to select more aggressive cutting parameters as long as the flank-wear remains below 0. 3 mm and the notch wear is limited either through path programming (by varying depth of cut) or by reducing feed rate to < 0. 2 mm/rev. Finally, a polar diagram method for describing and evaluating the machinability of Alloy 718 was developed. To do this five key parameters that included adhesion, strain hardening, thermal conductivity, hardness and abrasiveness were selected to construct a polar diagram for different batches of Alloy 718 from data for similar production parts. Thereafter, related production experiments were conducted to test the relationship between the polar diagram, tool wear and the role of carbon content when machining with ceramic cutting tools. The results showed that materials like Alloy 718 with similar machinability polar diagrams in size and shape exhibited very similar behavior during cutting processes. Thus, the polar diagram method is useful and helpful to choose the suitable cutting data for a new material in machining processes.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the early}} stages of seed {{development}} many genes are under dynamic regulation to ensure the proper differentiation and establishment of the tissue that will constitute the mature grain. To investigate how miRNA regulation contributes to this process in barley, a combination of small RNA and mRNA degradome analyses were used to identify miRNAs and their targets. Results Our analysis identified 84 known miRNAs and 7 new miRNAs together with 96 putative miRNA target genes regulated through a <b>slicing</b> mechanism in <b>grain</b> tissues during the first 15 [*]days post anthesis. We also identified many potential miRNAs including several belonging to known miRNA families. Our data gave us evidence for an increase in miRNA-mediated regulation during the transition between pre-storage and storage phases. Potential miRNA targets were found in various signalling pathways including components of four phytohormone pathways (ABA, GA, auxin, ethylene) and the defence response to powdery mildew infection. Among the putative miRNA targets we identified were two essential genes controlling the GA response, a GA 3 oxidase 1 and a homolog of the receptor GID 1, and a homolog of the ACC oxidase which catalyses the last step of ethylene biosynthesis. We found that two MLA genes are potentially miRNA regulated, establishing a direct link between miRNAs and the R gene response. Conclusion Our dataset provides a useful source of information on miRNA regulation during the early development of cereal grains and our analysis suggests that miRNAs contribute to the control of development of the cereal grain, notably through the regulation of phytohormone response pathways. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on accumulation of starch was studied in <b>grain</b> <b>slices</b> of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv SUN 9 E), taken 15 days after anthesis. As compared with pretreatment of such slices at 25 °C, pretreatment at 30 or 35 °C reduced the subsequent conversion of sucrose to starch. In contrast to rice (Oryza sativa cv Calrose), pretreatment of wheat soluble starch synthase in vitro at 30 °C or higher temperatures reduced its activity. In zymograms using nondenaturing {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} followed by activity staining, the slowest migrating band represented the most temperature sensitive isozyme. Although preincubation of a soluble enzyme sample in vitro at 25 °C {{did not result in}} loss of starch synthase activity, it did result in a gradual shift of zymogram banding pattern toward faster migrating species. Pretreatment of isolated starch granules at 40 °C increased their bound starch synthase activity. Both soluble and bound enzymes in the grains of whole wheat plants lost activity when the plants were held above 30 °C for 30 minutes or longer. Both activities lost from the grains after a 1 hour treatment at 37 °C were restored in 1 to 2 days by a return to 21 °C. In slices, inactivation of the soluble starch synthase was increased by incubation with 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. It is tentatively suggested that in vivo heat inactivation of soluble starch synthase may be a direct effect of heat on the enzyme protein and that of bound enzyme an indirect effect involving metabolic factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} on-the-farm grain storage bins are built of shallow {{cylindrical}} shells made of cold-formed sheet steel. They constitute a major {{section of the}} farm building industry. However, little reliable data is available regarding the resultant loads applied to the walls by the material stored. The present study is directed to develop additional information regarding the pressures and the pressure-inducing characteristics of the grain stored taking into consideration {{the interaction between the}} grain pressure and the deformation of the wall of the bin. The finite element method is applied considering a composite <b>slice</b> of the <b>grain</b> and the surrounding wall of the bin. It accounts for the flexibility of the wall, the non-linearity of the grain material, and for the variation of grain properties due to the confining pressure and strain level. A test was conducted on a model of a cylindrical bin filled with sand. The properties of the sand are obtained from a triaxial test. The experimentally measured pressures of the sand are found to be in close agreement with those obtained analytically. The understanding of interaction between the grain pressures and wall deformations lead to suggesting a new shape for the bin walls. Herein, the wall is curved in the vertical direction towards the grain in order to increase the strength of the wall through its interaction with the grain pressure.
