30|$|The {{acceleration}} of migration {{has become one}} of the salient features of recent years, and economic factors are often framed as the driving force behind the movement of people. As migration has become a global phenomenon, the feminization of migration (Piper 2004; Lan 2008 a; Cheng 2010; Thapan 2008; Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2002) is an even more significant but less explored topic. For example, it was not until recently that international <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> began to include data by gender (Zlotnik 2003; Lan 2008 a). According to many scholars (Constable 2003, 2009; Piper 2004; Yamanaka and Piper 2005; Jones and Shen 2008; Palriwala and Uberoi 2008), gender not only helps to understand women’s role in migration, but even migration itself is a gendered phenomenon. As Thapan states, “While viewing women migrants as dependents, we may often ignore their individual economic contributions, and an analysis based solely on official figures would give an inadequate account of the actual migration flows pertaining to women” (Thapan 2008 : 10). It is therefore necessary to uncover the gender bias that devalues foreign brides’ 6 economic roles and capabilities and to apply a new perspective and logic to understand their agency and contributions.|$|E

40|$|Rural {{economy of}} Punjab has been {{undergoing}} structural transformation. But {{the dependence of}} rural population in general and rural labour in particular for earning livelihood from the rural economy continues. This process of rural transformation has perpetuated the distress among the rural workforce. It is strange phenomenon that migrant labour continues to pour into the rural areas. The rural economy of Punjab, due to wage gap, continues to attract huge amount of inflow of people from other poorer states of India. Rural-rural migration, which is largely seasonal and stay of workers in most cases, is less than six months. Therefore, the official <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> grossly under record the rural-rural migration. Attempt {{has been made in}} this paper to fill this gap. Despite the fact that rural real wage rate has declined between the period 1990 and 2000, however, rural-rural migration has increased during the same period. The majority of the migrants (more than 90 per cent) are able to find work in agriculture up to 50 days in a year.

Linkage with other registers is also possible (and available for researchers) in the countries with a long tradition of register-based statistical accounting (such as Denmark or Sweden), but not in Germany with its historical reluctance towards centralized and linked registers after the experience of the Third Reich.

40|$|This thesis {{will argue}} that high levels of {{internal}} migration in Gilded Age America undermined the stability and growth of trade unions and labour-based parties. Most of the traditional ‘American Exceptionalist’ arguments which asserted a lack of class consciousness will be challenged. Significant weight {{will be given to}} the racial, ethnic, and gender divisions within the American working class as a source of relative organizational weakness. As archival sources reveal, however, despite their divisions, workers of all ethnic and racial groups drawn into wage-labour in the Gilded Age often displayed high levels of class consciousness and political radicalism through their actions, organizations, and hundreds of weekly labour papers. They also showed an awareness of the problems of frequent migration or ‘tramping’ in building stable organizations. Driven by the tumultuous conditions of uneven industrialization, millions of people migrated from state-to-state, country-to-city, and city-to-city at rates far higher than in Europe. A detailed analysis of the <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration,</b> work-related travelling, and union membership trends shows that this created a high level of membership turnover in the major organizations of the day—the American Federation of Labour and the Knights of Labour. Confronted in the 1880 s with the highest level of migration in the period, the Knights of Labour saw rapid growth turn into continuous decline. The more stable craft unions also saw significant membership loss to migration through an ineffective travelling card system. The organizational weakness that resulted undermined efforts by American workers to build independent labour-based parties in the 1880 s and 1890 s. ‘Pure-and-simple’ unionism would triumph {{by the end of the}} century despite the existence of a significant socialist minority in organized labour...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of both the}} dimensions and main features of the foreign population in Southern European host countries (Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal) {{is not an easy}} task. In addition to the typical problems of <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> flows and migrant population stocks, the presence of a sizeable and dynamic irregular component is a major hindrance. Even for the estimation of the legal presence, administrative sources are often not exhaustive, either because they capture different subsets of the whole universe of regular foreigners (as in the case of Italy) or because of very restrictive immigration policies preventing migrants from keeping legal status for long (Greece). Moving within this context, this work sets out to highlight some new evidence on the recent evolution of foreign populations in Southern Europe. 1 The approach is based on the comparison and integration of several data sources, jointly used to draw the quantitative evolution of the stock of foreigners living in the four countries in the last ten to fifteen years. Although the bulk of the analysis is focused on regular foreign presence, data from the periodic regularisation programmes are also used to stress the role of illegal migration and to emphasise the impact of such policies on the size and characteristics of the foreign population. A strong focus of this paper is on the changes in the geographical origins of recent immigrants. Some patterns shared by all Southern European countries as well as some features specific to national contexts are pointed out. By analysing the changing structures by nationality, we try to understand how the role of the Southern European host countries has changed in the European migration scenario, making them increasingly attractive destinations especially for migrants leaving Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Balkans...|$|E

40|$|Includes {{humanitarian}} entrant estimates between 1947 – 48 and 1976 – 77 and Humanitarian Program visa grants since 1977 – 78. Summary Australia has a {{long history}} of accepting refugees and other humanitarian entrants from all parts of the globe, including those in need of assistance during and immediately after World War II. Since 1945, when the first  federal immigration  portfolio was established to administer Australia’ s post - war migration program, over  80 0, 000 refugees and displaced persons have settled in Australia. However, it was not until Indochinese asylum seekers, fleeing conflict during the Vietnam War, began to arrive by boat that the Australian Government developed a specific refugee policy. Australia’ s first planned Humanitarian Program designed to deal with refugee and humanitarian issues, including the determination of onshore protection claims, was subsequently established by the Fraser Government in 1977. Since then, permanent migrants  have entered Australia via one of two distinct programs — the Migration Program for skilled and family migrants or the Humanitarian Program for refugees and those in refugee - like  situations. The Australian Government allocates places, or quotas, each year for people wanting to migrate permanently to Australia under these two programs. Annual <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> <b>Migration</b> and Humanitarian Program ‘outcomes’ (visa grants) published by the Immigration Department since the 1970 s, provide the most accurate source of data on the number of people granted visas to migrate to Australia. It is important to understand that there are two main components of Australia’s Humanitarian Program — offshore and onshore:  • the offshore component of the Humanitarian Program offers resettlement in Australia to refugees and humanitarian entrants from overseas under two categories. Most offshore refugees are referred to Australia by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and are formally accepted and resettled under the ‘Refugee’ category. These entrants have been assessed and accepted as refugees under Refugee Convention criteria. The Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) also offers resettlement to those offshore who, while not necessarily being refugees, face human rights abuses in their home country and have a connection with Australia. Applicants must have a sponsor (e. g. a permanent resident, Australian citizen or organisation).   Applications from family members of people already in Australia are referred to as ‘split family’. • the onshore component  of the Humanitarian Program  offers protection to people who have arrived in  Australia, lodged an asylum claim, and been granted protection. Onshore humanitarian entrants may have  been found to be refugees under Refugee Convention criteria or may otherwise engage Australia’s protection  obligations under other  human rights conventions...|$|E

40|$|Population {{migration}} flow is {{a component}} of population facing difficulties in measuring in the inter-census period of time. The rationale {{of this study is}} that Romanian <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> international <b>migration</b> flows are of very poor quality, the availability of data on past trends being strongly limited, provided only from administrative sources. For this reason, in the inter-census period, the variable of interest is provided by the labour force survey available at national and regional level every quarter of the year since 2004. The smaller disaggregation like localities level using direct estimators conducts to results of unreliable estimates and will surely lead to higher standard error and consequently, high coefficients of variation. The main reason for this is the insufficient number of respondents or no respondent at all in a small domain. Small area estimation techniques are able to carry out the estimation at the localities level (NUTS 5). The main purpose is to provide methods able to estimate the population in Romania, based on the Labour Force Survey and also the results of 2002, respectively 2011 population census. ...|$|R
40|$|The South-east Europe and Black Sea region {{presents}} a fertile terrain for examin- ing recent international migration trends. A {{wide range of}} types of migration {{can be observed in}} this region: large-scale emigration in many countries, recent mass immigration in the case of Greece, return migration, internal migration, internal and external forced migration, irregular migration, brain drain etc. These migratory phenomena occur within the context of EU migration policies and EU accession for some countries. Yet within this shifting migration landscape of migrant stocks and flows, the fundamental economic geography of different wealth levels and work opportunities is what drives most migration, now as in the past.

Deficiencies in migration statistics may be tackled using modelling techniques, which has recently been recognised by the European Union (EU) policymakers. The new Regulation <b>on</b> Community <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> international <b>migration,</b> which obliges countries to supply harmonised statistics, provides for the possibility of using estimation methods to adapt <b>statistics</b> based <b>on</b> national definitions to comply with the required 1 -year duration of stay definition. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a theoretical probabilistic framework to capture various migration flow statistics that are available. It is a crucial step towards better understanding and then harmonising the data. Different migration measures represent the same continuous data-generating process. They differ depending on how the data happened to be collected and how the statistics happened to be produced. We introduce the key concepts of migration statistics using a simple duration model, namely an exponential distribution. While more complex models can better reflect the reality, they do not fundamentally modify the framework presented. The main focus is put on the time criterion used in the migration definition. It refers to the duration of stay following relocation, which is specified very differently among countries and constitutes the main source of discrepancies in operationalisation of the migration concept in the EU member states.

This was influenced by significant changes on the political scene of Europe and the world, globalisation, international capital flows, technical-technological progress, the IT revolution and so forth. International migration trends are mainly analysed {{from the perspective of the}} recipient countries, while research from the perspective of the origin countries is much rarer, and especially those which include both aspects. At the same time, there is an evident lack of reliable information containing data <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> trends between countries of origin and destination, regional origin and demographic structures of migrants, which hinders a more detailed territorial analysis. Serbia does not have satisfactory <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> international <b>migration</b> as well, even though it is a country with long emigration tradition. The census data on the Serbian nationals working or residing abroad, regardless of the relatively large census undercount, present the main sources of statistical information on the characteristics of Serbian emigration, and practically the only source of data on their regional origin and socio-demographic features. Regional differences in view of the share of nationals abroad are very pronounced in Serbia. They were established as early as 1971 the Census and confirmed by every following census. The 2002 Census results indicated there were three typical emigration zones. The aim of the paper is to determine whether there have been changes in the spatial distribution of the emigrants from the regional aspect of Serbia as an origin country, based on 2011 Census final results. The characteristics of the Serbian citizens abroad, according to age and sex, length of stay abroad, country of destination and ethnic composition, have also been analyzed in this paper.
