5|$|Aviation {{service was}} pioneered {{in the early}} 20th century in colonial Dutch East Indies. On 1 October 1924, KLM started its first {{intercontinental}} flight, connecting Amsterdam to Batavia (now Jakarta) in a Fokker F-VII airplane. By September 1929 KLM had started regularly <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> between Amsterdam and Batavia. The route connected Amsterdam to Marseille, Rome, Brindisi, Athens, Merza Matruh, Cairo, Gaza, Baghdad, Bushire, Lingeh, Ojask, Gwadar, Karachi, Jodhpur, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok, Alor Star, Medan, Palembang, and Batavia, and extended to Bandung. Until {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, this was the world's longest-distance <b>scheduled</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|A civil airport, Białystok-Krywlany Airport, {{lies within}} the city limits, but does not provide {{regularly}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>service.</b> There were plans in 2011 {{to build a new}} regional airport, Białystok-Saniki Airport, that would have provided flights within Europe.|$|E
5|$|A regular {{bus service}} links West and East Mersea to Colchester via the Strood and Abberton. A foot ferry runs from East Mersea to Point Clear and Brightlingsea {{on the other}} side of the Colne estuary, {{including}} a <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> in the summer and a dial-on-demand service in the spring and autumn.|$|E
50|$|There are {{airports}} at Khorat (at {{the present}} time no <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> due to its proximity to Bangkok making air service difficult to justify financially), Khon Kaen (domestic), Ubon Ratchathani (domestic), Udon Thani (international), Nakhon Phanom (domestic, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services),</b> Sakon Nakhon (domestic, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services),</b> Roi Et (domestic, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services),</b> Buriram (domestic, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services)</b> and Loei (domestic, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services).</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to operating regional, short-haul <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> {{on its own}} account, BIA was also contracted by other airlines to operate <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> on their behalf.|$|R
50|$|In late 2014 {{the airline}} began four times weekly <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> to Tokyo (Narita) using Boeing 767-200 aircraft. Further <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> to be {{launched}} include Jakarta, Jeddah and Tianjin.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the airport focused on {{attracting}} foreign airlines. In 1994, Condor Flugdienst began charter flights from Germany, launching <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> from Cologne and Frankfurt in 1997. Northwest Airlines and Japan Airlines introduced flights from Tokyo in 1998, and Virgin Atlantic began flying from London–Gatwick in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines only {{operated}} a single <b>scheduled</b> <b>service,</b> between Oslo and London. The route was flown nine times per week, two round trips per day on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, and one round trip per day on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The route saw an average 60,000 to 70,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous to Midway's {{expansion}}, ATA Airlines began {{rapid expansion}} at Midway {{in the early}} 2000s (decade), and was the airport's dominant carrier prior to 2004, using 14 of the 17 gates in Concourse A. However, after the airline declared bankruptcy in October 2004, <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> from Midway significantly decreased.|$|E
40|$|Airlines' revenue {{generated}} from <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> {{account for the}} major share in the total revenue. As such, predicting airlines' total <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> revenue is of great importance both to the governments (in case of national airlines) and private airlines. This importance stems from the need to formulate future airline strategic management policies, determine government subsidy levels, and formulate governmental air transportation policies. The prediction of the airlines' total <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> revenue is dealt with in this paper. Four key components of airline's <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> are considered. These include revenues {{generated from}} passenger, cargo, mail, and excess baggage. By addressing the revenue generated from each <b>schedule</b> <b>service</b> separately, air transportation planners and designers arc able to enhance their ability to formulate specific strategies for each component. Estimation results clearly indicate that the four stochastic processes (<b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> components) are represented by different Box-Jenkins ARIMA models. The results demonstrate {{the appropriateness of the}} developed models and their ability to provide air transportation planners with future information vital to the planning and design processes...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, the CAA awarded BCal a licence to {{commence}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> from Gatwick to Riyadh and authorised the airline to operate dedicated <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> to Abu Dhabi, Doha, Dubai and Muscat, rather than serving these destinations as intermediate points only.|$|R
5|$|The town {{is home to}} the Plymouth Municipal Airport, {{which lies}} on the border between Plymouth and Carver. Founded in 1931, it offers <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> to Nantucket, as well as private service. The airport {{features}} a local restaurant and gift shop, but does not have an on-site traffic control tower.|$|E
5|$|Air Rhodesia Flight 825 was a {{scheduled}} passenger flight that {{was shot down}} by the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) on 3 September 1978, during the Rhodesian Bush War. The aircraft involved, a Vickers Viscount named the Hunyani, was flying {{the last leg of}} Air Rhodesia's regular <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury, via the resort town of Kariba.|$|E
5|$|In February 1987, Greyhound Lines' new {{ownership}} and the ATU {{agreed on a}} new, 3-year contract. In June 1987, Greyhound Lines acquired Trailways, Inc. (formerly Continental Trailways), the largest member of the rival National Trailways Bus System, effectively consolidating into a national bus service. Greyhound was required by the ICC, in their action approving the merger, to maintain coordinated schedules with other <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> operators in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) {{provide new}} {{opportunities}} {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emission. PEVs need to draw and store energy from an electrical grid to supply propulsive {{energy for the}} vehicle. As a result, {{it is important to know}} when PEVs batteries are available for charging and discharging. Furthermore, battery energy management and control is imperative for PEVs as the vehicle operation and even the safety of passengers depend on the battery system. Thus, scheduling the grid power electricity with parking lots would be needed for efficient charging and discharging of PEV batteries. This paper aims to propose a new intelligent battery energy management and control <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> charging that utilize Cloud computing networks. The proposed intelligent vehicle-to-grid <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> offers the computational scalability required to make decisions necessary to allow PEVs battery energy management systems to operate efficiently when the number of PEVs and charging devices are large. Experimental analyses of the proposed <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> as compared to a traditional <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> are conducted through simulations. The results show that the proposed intelligent battery energy management <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> substantially reduces the required number of interactions of PEV with parking lots and grid as well as predicting the load demand calculated in advance with regards to their limitations. Also it shows that the intelligent <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> charging using Cloud computing network is more efficient than the traditional <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> network for battery energy management and control...|$|R

5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, {{the second}} to replace a {{withdrawn}} Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route alongside passengers. The <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three vehicles, on 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later.|$|E
5|$|In May 1949, it was {{reported}} that Lympne had made a loss of £17,000 and that the Air Ministry was looking to dispose of it, although it was thought that should a sale not materialise it would continue in operation. In August 1950, Air Kruise started a <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> between Lympne and Le Touquet using Dragon Rapides. This service was operated under an associate airline agreement with British European Airways.|$|E
5|$|The Plymouth & Brockton Street Railway Company offers <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> to Logan Airport, {{downtown}} Boston, Hyannis, and Provincetown.

5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture for sheep. The first <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E

5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> in the country.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of her American-Hawaiian career, American sailed in <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan, up to San Francisco {{and from there to}} Honolulu. Along the way, she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all {{subsequent}} American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E
