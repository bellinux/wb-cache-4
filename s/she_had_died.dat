5|$|Vermigli's wife, Catherine, {{had become}} {{well known in}} Oxford for her piety and {{ministry}} to expectant mothers. She also enjoyed carving faces into plum stones. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> childless in the February before Vermigli left. Soon after Vermigli's departure, Cardinal Pole had her disinterred and thrown on a dungheap. Following the accession of Protestant Queen Elizabeth in 1558, she was re-interred with the relics of Saint Frithuswith in Christ Church Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died,</b> because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{inquiries}} into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47-year-old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner and to look after the licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green. Police believed at first that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> of natural causes. An autopsy failed to establish a cause of death, and her body was returned to Ireland for burial.|$|E

5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died.</b> After her death was announced, media and camera crews appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death. Distressed {{by the death of}} another sibling, the Queen, who had suffered from a heart disease most of her life, had two heart attacks in October. Both were so severe that her doctors thought that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died.</b> When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{contemporaneous}} {{or nearly}} contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>died</b> childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E
