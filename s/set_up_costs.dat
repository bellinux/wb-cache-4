40|$|This paper {{concerns}} lot-sizing in a multistage and multifacility {{pure distribution}} network. A facility {{at the end}} of the distribution network experiences a deterministic and continuous demand. Each facility has an echelon holding cost rate for each item it distributes, and a facility-dependent <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>cost.</b> In this paper an algorithm is presented of complexity 0 (rd log r) where r is the number of end facilities and d is the maximum depth of the distribution system. The algorithm exploits a lower bound obtained by decomposing the distribution network into facilities-in-series problems. Using a <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>cost</b> allocation procedure, the maximum of the continuous solution of the decomposed problem is obtained. This maximizing solution provides the lower bound which is used for solving the distribution problem. This gives a power-of-two heuristic with a worst case performance no more than 2 % above optimal. inventory, multi-stage, distribution, lower bound, heuristic...|$|R

40|$|Zero Inventory (ZI) {{is a new}} and {{powerful}} concept to improve production efficiency. Underpinning ZI is set up reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> are cut. The folklore is that set up reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. Set up cost reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of set up cost reduction is provided. Most presentations of ZI have been descriptive with very few mathematical models of it yet untaken. By modeling certain ZI concepts mathematically, we scrutinize their validity and sometimes invalidity. inventory/production: zero inventory, facilities/equipment: planning, inventory/production: parametric analysis...|$|E

40|$|Zero {{inventory}} (ZI) and {{the related}} concepts of Just in Time and Kanban are innovative and powerful means to improve production efficiency. This paper applies these concepts to a series facility production system and, in particular, identifies which facilities will never hold inventory irrespective of product demand. Pinpointing beforehand that certain facilities will have no inventory can simplify such strategic decisions as facility design, site location, and space utilization, plus it eases production scheduling. Next, a procedure is developed which increases the number of facilities that will never hold inventory. This procedure implements the ZI philosophy of cutting <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> to increase efficiency.
