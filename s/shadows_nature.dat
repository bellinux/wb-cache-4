60|$|It {{was late}} {{afternoon}} when we issued at last from our two days Thermopylae upon the Etchiu plain. As we drew out into its expanse, the giant peaks of the Tateyama range came into view from behind their foothills, draped still in their winter ermine. It was last year yet in those upper regions of the world, but all about us below throbbed with the heartbeats of the spring. At each mile, amid the ever lengthening <b>shadows,</b> <b>nature</b> seemed to grow more sentient. Through the thick air the peaks stood out against the eastern sky, in saffron that flushed to rose and then paled to gray. The ricefields, already flooded for their first working, mirrored the glow overhead so glassily that their dykes seemed to float, in sunset illusion, a mere bar tracery of earth between the sky above and a sky beneath. Upon such lattice of a world we journeyed in mid-heaven. Stealthily the shadows gathered; and as the hour for confidences drew on, nature took us into hers. The trees in the twilight, just breaking into leaf, stood in groups among the fields and whispered low to one another, nodding their heads; and then from out {{the shadow of the}} May evening came the croaking of the frogs. Strangely the sound fitted the hour, with its like touch of mysterious suggestion. As the twilight indefinite, it pervaded everything, yet was never anywhere. Deafening at a distance, it hushed at our approach only to begin again behind us. Will-o'-the-wisp of the ear, infatuating because forever illusive! And the distance and the numbers blended what had perhaps been harsh into a mellow whole that filled the gloaming with a sort of voice. I began to understand why the Japanese are so fond of it that they deem it not unworthy a place in nature's vocal pantheon but little lower than the song of the nightingale, and echo its sentiment in verse. And indeed {{it seems to me that}} his soul must be conventionally tuned in whom this even-song of the ricefields stirs no responsive chord.|$|E

Past research had suggested that urban alleys and narrow canyons would exhibit such a pattern. Comparison categories, chosen to be high in mystery and low in perceived danger, were urban and non-urban nature (that is, field-and-forest settings within urban or non-urban environments), respectively. Preference ratings were obtained for settings {{from each of the}} four categories. The settings were also rated by independent raters for six predictor variables: mystery, physical danger, social danger, <b>shadow,</b> <b>nature,</b> and vertical depth. The major findings were that danger was a negative predictor of preference and mystery was a positive predictor. There was no evidence that high mystery was involved in depressed preference ratings for any of the environmental categories investigated. The distinction between physical and social danger proved useful, with only social danger related (negatively) to preference...|$|R

60|$|This is {{what has}} just {{happened}} in our political hygiene. Political science has been as recklessly neglected by Governments and electorates during my lifetime as sanitary science was {{in the days of}} Charles the Second. In international relations diplomacy has been a boyishly lawless affair of family intrigues, commercial and territorial brigandage, torpors of pseudo-goodnature produced by laziness and spasms of ferocious activity produced by terror. But in these islands we muddled through. Nature gave us a longer credit than she gave to France or Germany or Russia. To British centenarians who died in their beds in 1914, any dread of having to hide underground in London from the shells of an enemy seemed more remote and fantastic than a dread of the appearance of a colony of cobras and rattlesnakes in Kensington Gardens. In the prophetic works of Charles Dickens we were warned against many evils which have since come to pass; but of the evil of being slaughtered by a foreign foe on our own doorsteps there was no <b>shadow.</b> <b>Nature</b> gave us a very long credit; and we abused it to the utmost. But when she struck at last she struck with a vengeance. For four years she smote our firstborn and heaped on us plagues of which Egypt never dreamed. They were all as preventable as the great Plague of London, and came solely because they had not been prevented. They were not undone by winning the war. The earth is still bursting with the dead bodies of the victors.|$|R
60|$|And {{it is most}} {{singular}} {{that this}} separation, which is the great source of brilliancy in nature, should not only be unobserved, but absolutely forbidden by our great writers on art, who are always talking about connecting the light with the shade by imperceptible gradations. Now so surely as this is done, all sunshine is lost, for imperceptible gradation from light to dark is the characteristic of objects seen out of sunshine, in what is, in landscape, <b>shadow.</b> <b>Nature's</b> principle of getting light is the direct reverse. She will cover her whole landscape with middle tint, in which she will have as many gradations as you please, and a great many {{more than you can}} paint; but on this middle tint she touches her extreme lights, and extreme darks, isolated and sharp, so that the eye goes to them directly, and feels them to be key-notes of the whole composition. And although the dark touches are less attractive than the light ones, it is not because they are less distinct, but because they exhibit nothing; while the bright touches are in parts where everything is seen, and where in consequence the eye goes to rest. But yet the high lights do not exhibit anything in themselves, they are too bright and dazzle the eye; and having no shadows in them, cannot exhibit form, for form can only be seen by shadow of some kind or another. Hence the highest lights and deepest darks agree in this, that nothing is seen in either of them; that both are in exceedingly small quantity, and both are marked and distinct from the middle tones of the landscape--the one by their brilliancy, the other by their sharp edges, even though many of the more energetic middle tints may approach their intensity very closely.|$|R

Present reconstruction techniques, whether stereo vision, structure from motion, laser range finding, etc. make explicit or implicit assumptions about the BRDF. Here, we introduce two methods that were developed by re-examining the underlying image formation process; the methods make no assumptions about the object’s shape, {{the presence or absence}} of <b>shadowing,</b> or. the <b>nature</b> of the BRDF which may vary over the surface. The first method takes advantage of Helmholtz reciprocity, while the second method exploits the fact that the, radiance along a ray of light is constant. In particular, the first method uses stereo pairs of images in which point light sources are co-located at the centers of projection of the stereo cameras. The second method is based on double covering a scene’s incident light field; the depths of surface points are estimated using a large collection of images in which the viewpoint remains fixed and a point light source illuminates the object. Results from our implementations lend empirical support to both techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a saying}} that all genius, whether {{religious}} or artistic, {{is a kind of}} excess, and it is natural that a genius, an excess himelf, should be attracted by excessiveness in others. Marlowe was a genius. Fascinated with the wild craving for absolute power of an ambitious Tartar conqueror, he wrote Tamburlaine, and, enchanted by the ardent thirst for knowledge of a legendary German scholar, he produced Doctor Faustus. Into Barabas in The Jew of Malta did he embody insatiable lust for "infinite riches" and their potential power. All the protagonists of these plays have excessiveness in common and may safely be called, in a sense, transcendent men. In the opening scenes Barabas is shown as a merchant prince with dignity and grandness, but when he has been wrongly deprived of his goods by the Christian Governor of Malta he changes into a monstrous incarnation of evil and vengeance, devoid of the slightest <b>shadow</b> of human <b>nature.</b> The subsequent scenes reveal a series of the crimes he commits by playing Machiavellian tricks of his own device-all murder, including that of his beloved and loving daughter. Marlowe, who is an excessive accuser of orthodox religious creeds, puts into Barabas's mouth cynical abuses especially against Christian hypocrisy. Consequently this play would be too repulsive and too horrible for an audience of ordinary {{men and women of the}} workaday world, if the effect were not mitigated by the comic and farcial touches which characterize some of its scenes. Some critics point out its lack of harmony in tone and regard it as a "savage farce", "serious farce", "tragic comedy" etc., but The Jew of Malta is essentially a tragedy, for what can be more tragic for human beings than losing human nature? The subplots of this play are so cleverly interrelated that it makes a fine structure as a whole, and in this respect it surpasses the other two of the triad...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{investigation}} into the possibility of learning from different architectural cultures. Specifically, this project investigates selected Japanese architectural principles. Relevant principles are obtained and applied to a New Zealand context. The project develops a design for a Cistercian monastery to be built within the Christchurch central business district (C. B. D.) area. Japanese architectural principles include benefits of power and appeal with respect to aesthetics and as solutions to architectural problems. This project focuses on appropriate Japanese architectural principles such as ma/oku/miegakure (space, time and glimpse), light and <b>shadow,</b> connection with <b>nature,</b> layering, refinement and the design of a city site. Additionally it analyses the aspects of the work of Tadao Ando because of his specific architectural position. The aim is to create an unfamiliar piece of architecture in which new/lost ways of designing can be portrayed and exemplified. The (Christian) Cistercian monastic order has been selected because of its closeness to Japanese Buddhist architectural principles in their minimalist refined approaches and meditative spirit. The monastic typology acts as a precedent in which the aforementioned Japanese architectural principles could be used within a typology with which New Zealand is unfamiliar. The project involves the design of a Cistercian monastery based upon traditional functions and requirements. The monastic ideal of seclusion is used in the design of a trauma centre to be established in Christchurch to facilitate the mental healing of victims traumatised by the recent Christchurch earthquakes. This function adheres to past requirements of Cistercian monastic orders to help create a revenue stream. Christchurch City has been selected due to the current lack of integration between the Avon River and surrounding buildings; this project presents ideas on ways to change this. Because the selected site is located in Christchurch, the building’s resilience must be looked at to ensure an outcome that is suited to the significant and particular environmental factors of that city. The process of design exploration uses different methods {{in order to create a}} cumulative synthesis of research by, for and into design. This provides an architectural resonance with all required encompassing ideas.

40|$|The topic {{which has}} been {{assigned}} to me, "Classification Today- Shadow or Substance," might more appropriately have come {{at the end of}} the Institute, rather than the beginning. If I could convince you that our pursuit of valid classifications was the pursuit of a shadow, there would be no reason to listen to the papers on the remaining part of the program. We could all pack up and go home. Hence, I must conclude that when those who planned this Institute gave me this topic, they assumed that regardless of what I might say about classification, I would certainly be unable to demonstrate its ephemeral or shadowy nature and that I would conclude that classification had substantial value for librarianship and related information activities. Confronted with this dilemma, it occurred to me that the way out for an erstwhile student of logic like myself might be found in the first instance not in examining the <b>nature</b> of <b>shadows</b> nor the <b>nature</b> of substances, but in examining the meaning of the connective between them, namely, the logical operator "or. " Most of us, when we think of the word "or," think of it in the exclusive sense as meaning "either or," that is, the word used in this title, "Shadow or Substance," would ordinarily be interpreted to mean that if classification were substantial it could not be shadowy, or if it were shadowy, it could not be substantial. There is, however, another meaning of "or" which is the usual meaning attributed to it in works of logic, where the "or" is taken as meaning logical disjunction with reference to propositions and logical sum with reference to classes. In this sense "or" means "and/or" rather than "either or. " Thus if I say "It will rain tomorrow or I will stay home," both statements could be true; that is, it might rain tomorrow and I could still stay home. Similarly, if I say of an item that it is a member of the class A or B, it could be a member of A, a member of B, or a member of AB, and the general proposition "X is a member of A or B" is true in all three cases. This general proposition is only false when the item is a member of neither A nor B. This logical relation can be illustrated by the truth table for disjunction at the top of the following page. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction and {{modeling}} of 3 -D geometry {{are among the}} core issues in computer vision. While geometry composed of radiometrically simple materials is currently relatively easy to reconstruct and model, geometry with complex reflectance properties presents a substantial challenge. The research work presented here is an investigation of this problem. Two methods are proposed that are specifically designed to handle geometry with complex photometric properties. The first proposed method is designed to reconstruct large-scale geometry with arbitrary and possibly anisotropic BRDFs. Existing reconstruction techniques typically make explicit or implicit assumptions about the reflectance properties of a surface. The proposed method uses the idea of photometric ranging, where no such assumptions are necessary. In a photometric stereo-like setup of multiple images obtained from a single viewpoint under controlled illumination, photometric ranging recovers the depth directly for each camera pixel, rather than through surface normal field integration. It exploits the basic concept of radiant energy density falloff with distance from a point light source. Double-covering the incident light field allows to find sets of coincidental pairs of light directions where this {{can be used to}} align the reflected light fields and directly reconstruct the depth of a scene. Unlike photometric stereo, in photometric ranging no assumptions are required about the surface smoothness, {{the presence or absence of}} <b>shadowing,</b> or the <b>nature</b> of the BRDF, which may vary over the surface. Once the depth of a scene is known, the reflected light field can also be resampled to relight the scene, that is to render the same scene from the camera view, but under novel lighting, including nearby and distant sources. The second proposed method aims to model small-scale geometry of volumetric surface materials with complex reflectance. Instead of recovering the intricate geometry itself, it uses an appearance-based approach of volumetric texturing, which is a popular technique for rendering rich 3 -D detail when a polygonal surface representation would be ineffective. Although efficient algorithms for rendering volumetric textures have been known for years, capturing the richness of real volumetric materials remains a challenging problem. The proposed technique generates a volumetric representation of a complex 3 -D texture with unknown reflectance and structure. From the acquired reflectance data in the form of a 6 -D Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF), the proposed method creates an efficient volumetric representation in the form of a stack of semi-transparent layers each representing a slice through the texture's volume. In addition to negligible storage requirements, this representation is ideally suited for hardware-accelerated real-time rendering...|$|R

40|$|Several commentaries {{have been}} written about the role that Nature has played in the {{literature}} of early America, including books by Wilson Ober Clough,Hans Huth and Norman Foerster. Each of these studies, however has virtually ignored a vital aspect of the Man-Nature relationship as it was conceived and as it matured in the young nation. From the beginning, the American view of Nature was influenced and often dictated by the American view of God and a complete picture of the role of Nature in this nation's literature cannot be gained without a consideration also of the role of God in those same writings. The thrust of this study is a consideration of the inter-relationships between God,Man,and nature as they were perceived and recorded by Jonathan Edwards, Philip Morin Freneau, William Cullen Bryant and Ralph Waldo Emerson. These four writers of the 18 th and 19 th centuries represent not only the essayists and poets of their respective centuries, but also some of the foremost religious, political and philosophical movements of their day. Edwards, like many Puritans before him, viewed Nature with a critical eye, recording the intricacies of her minutest forms with scientific interest. But more than this, he reveled in her beauties, finding in them a muted reflection of the ineffable beauty and majesty of God. Seeing in the workings of <b>Nature</b> <b>shadows</b> of Divine percepts, he began to compile a catalogue of those lessons which god had revealed for the edification of the Saints. Puritan doctrine imposed rigid controls upon the acquisition of these teachings, however. As Edwards taught these lessons, which were not new revelations of God, but rather illustrations of Biblical truths, could only be perceived by God’s Elect and then only when God chose to reveal them. Freneau’s view of Nature as teacher placed her in a role of greater importance. As a Deist, he believed that nature did not simply illustrate Biblical truths but was herself Man’s Bible. Like a book of ready answers about life and death, nature had been prepared in advance by a new remote God, who having fashioned a perfect universe to function in faultless rhythm, then sat back to simply watch it work. Rejecting the Puritan doctrine of the Elect, Freneau argued furthermore that Nature’s lessons were available to any individual who in earnestness sought them. Like Freneau, Bryant rejected any suggestion that nature’s secrets could be understood only by a chosen few. He found instead in the forests and mountains a vast and majestic cathedral in which an individual could reach upward with nature in earnest and loving worship of the creator. But he saw in nature, as well, an eager and sympathetic confidant, a comforter and a guide whose voice spoke freely to any who sought communion with her. Emerson, the Transcendentalist believed that through the very act of creation the Spirit of God flowed into and through every aspect of nature, making every particle in existence from the mightiest king to the smallest grain of sand partakers of his divinity. Man and nature were therefore one, sharing being within the over-soul. And since in the beginning god had thought each rock and tree and mountain into being, they existed as corporeal symbols of spiritual realities. Nature thus became the symbol of the spirit and as Emerson chose not to recognize the Bible as god’s guideline for mankind, nature became also an individual’s only avenue to God. Each of these four men Edwards, Freneau, Bryant and Emerson viewed nature from a slightly different perspective, their views influenced, in part at least by their understanding of God’s relationship to his creation. Yet what are most striking are not the differences in their beliefs, but rather the consistencies. Nature was for each of them, as indeed for most Americans to be admired for her majestic beauty preserved in her innocence and looked to her insight into the workings of God among Men. Jane E.
