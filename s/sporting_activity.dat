500|$|Hoffman {{was baptized}} a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} mass as a child, {{but did not}} have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, leaving the children to be raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, [...] "I was changed– permanently changed– by that experience. It was like a miracle to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of Quilters and Alms for the Middle Class, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his <b>sporting</b> <b>activity,</b> and he began to consider acting.

500|$|A {{commonly}} used defence for the torts of trespass against {{the person is}} that of volenti non fit injuria, or consent. If a claimant participates in a <b>sporting</b> <b>activity</b> in which physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This {{is not the case}} if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, as in R v Billinghurst, or where the injuries were suffered not from the claimant's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control. The same general rule applies to people who voluntarily take part in fights, although only if the injuries caused are proportionate, as in Lane v Holloway. If the claimant is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure, there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused; the claimant's agreement constitutes [...] "real consent", as in Chatterton v Gerson. Consent for medical procedures is different in cases where the claimant does not have the mental capacity to consent. In F v West Berkshire Health Authority, it was held that in such situations the requirements are that there [...] "must be a necessity to act when it is not practical to communicate with the assisted person ... the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take, acting {{in the best interests of}} the assisted person".|$|E
