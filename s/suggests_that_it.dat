5|$|The meteoritic {{hypothesis}} is now viewed by geologists as doubtful. The British Natural History Museum <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be a}} pseudometeorite, in other words a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.|$|E
5|$|The ride is themed {{around an}} erupting volcano. The {{name of the}} ride <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is related to the}} {{original}} Nemesis, an inverted coaster installed at Alton Towers in 1994.|$|E
5|$|A. m. columbianum:Genetic {{evidence}} for the 'central' subspecies (A. m. columbianum) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not extend north into British Columbia, but is restricted to the Blue and Wallowa Mountains of central to northeastern sections of Oregon. Populations are restricted to these areas by the Snake River Canyon (Idaho) {{to the east and}} low dry or xeric lands in the Madras basin to the west.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{anterior}} teeth and slender posterior teeth of Concavispina <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on soft-bodied {{animals such as}} fish and jellyfish while the pointed {{anterior teeth}} and broad posterior teeth of Xinpusaurus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on harder prey with shells.|$|R

5000|$|Cytosolic beta-glucosidase is a {{predominantly}} liver enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes beta-D-glucoside and beta-D-galactoside, but not any known physiologic beta-glycoside, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved}} in detoxification of plant glycosides. GBA3 also has significant neutral glycosylceramidase activity (...) , <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved in}} a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway of glucosylceramide metabolism.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric is a {{possible}} contender, as well as Rædwald, Eorpwald and Sigeberht, for being the East Anglian king who was buried within Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo. Rupert Bruce-Mitford <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is perhaps unlikely that Ecgric’s successor Anna, a devout Christian, would have given him a ship burial, {{but he does not}} dismiss the theory entirely.|$|E
5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can be caught by a fishing rod.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{hypotheses}} about the inscription <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> included: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of incipient seafloor spreading {{in the basin}} is under controversy. Some researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not occur within the basin because of the crustal thickness, magnetic anomaly patterns, and intracrustal diapirism. Other geoscientists <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is occurring and is related to seamount volcanism and normal faulting within the basin.|$|R
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observations}} will {{be needed}} in order to determine S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit. If it is circular, it would suggest that S/2015 (136472) 1 was formed by an ancient impact event, but if it is elliptical, it <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been captured.|$|E
5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that {{this might have been}} a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
500|$|Other {{proposals}} were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving {{and supporting the}} head. Othenio Abel proposed it {{was used as a}} weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used as a}} foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osmólska <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed salt glands, and John Ostrom <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities. One unusual suggestion, made by creationist Duane Gish, is that the crest housed chemical glands <b>that</b> allowed <b>it</b> to throw jets of chemical [...] "fire" [...] at enemies, similar to the modern-day bombardier beetle.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is similar to}} the ancestral eukaryote.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may {{represent}} a Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis.|$|R
5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. Great white shark hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey. However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the great white shark.|$|E
5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire. Various {{estimates}} have put its age at between 2,000 and 5,000 years; recent research into yew tree ages <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is likely to be}} nearer the lower limit of 2,000 years. This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. There is some controversy {{over the role of}} low body temperature as a risk factor for the common cold; the majority of the evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may result in greater susceptibility to infection.|$|E
50|$|Henodus, however, {{differs from}} other placodonts in having {{developed}} unique baleen-like denticles, which alongside {{features of the}} hyoid and jaw musculature <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a filter feeder. Recent comparisons to Atopodentatus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a herbivore as well, bearing a similar broad jaw shape, albeit it obtained plant matter through filter-feeding it from the substrates.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{date and}} {{location}} of composition is disputed: some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Salzburg, the boy's home town, in 1762 or 1763; others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Paris in 1763 or 1764, during Mozart's first visit to <b>that</b> city. <b>It</b> was published in Paris in February 1764, along with another violin sonata, K. 7, as Mozart's “Opus 1”.|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may {{increase}} the risk of pancreatic cancer.|$|R
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documented}} history of Ashby-de-la-Zouch before the Norman Conquest, although Roman coins {{were found in}} the area, and the town's name has both Saxon and Danish elements. It has an entry in the Domesday Book that <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had about 100 inhabitants in 1086, and subsequently grew in importance under its La Zouch and Hastings lords, notably William Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{changed her}} name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson {{suggests}} this happened {{right after the}} wedding, and Clinton <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly {{as part of a}} religious conversion, or to honor another relative.|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E

5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris {{may have been}} triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would have been in the}} vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E
