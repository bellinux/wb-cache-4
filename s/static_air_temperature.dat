40|$|Ice {{was formed}} on a {{full-scale}} unheated supersonic nose inlet in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel {{to determine its}} effect on compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery. Inlet angle of attack was varied from 0 degrees to 12 degrees, free-stream Mach number from 0. 17 to 0. 28, and compressor-face Mach number from 0. 10 to 0. 47. Icing-cloud liquid-water content was varied from 0. 65 to 1. 8 grams per cubic meter at free-stream <b>static</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 15 degrees and 0 degrees F. The addition of ice to the inlet components increased total-pressure-distortion levels and decreased recovery values compared withclear 0 air results, the losses increasing with time in ice. The combination of glaze ice, high corrected weight flow, and high angle of attack yielded {{the highest levels of}} distortion and lowest values of recovery. The general character of compressor-face distortion with an iced inlet was the same as that for the clean inlet, the total-pressure gradients being predominantly radial, with circumferential gradients occurring at angle of attack. At zero angle of attack, free-stream Mach number of 0. 27, and a constant corrected weight flow of 150 pounds per second (compressor-face Mach number of 0. 43), compressor-face total-pressure-distortion level increased from about 6 percent in clear air to 12 percent after 21 minutes of heavy glaze icing; concurrently, total-pressure recovery decreased from about 0. 98 to 0. 945. For the same operating conditions but with the inlet at 12 deg angle of attack, a change in distortion level occurred from about 9 percent in clear air to 14 percent after 2 - 1 / 4 minutes of icing, with a decrease in recovery from about 0. 97 to 0. 94...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been undertaken in a wind tunnel {{to study the}} induced airflow and drag reduction capability of AC glow discharge plasma actuators. Plasma is the fourth state of matter whereby a medium, such as air, is ionized creating a system of electrons, ions and neutral particles. Surface glow discharge plasma actuators have recently become a topic for flow control due {{to their ability to}} exert a body force near the wall of an aerodynamic object which can create or alter a flow. The exact nature of this force is not well understood, although the current state of knowledge is that the phenomenon results from the presence of charged plasma particles in a highly non-uniform electric field. Such actuators are lightweight, fully electronic (needing no moving parts or complicated ducting), have high bandwidth and high energy density. The manufacture of plasma actuators is relatively cheap and they can be easily retrofitted to existing surfaces. The first part of this study aims at characterising the airflow induced by surface plasma actuators in initially <b>static</b> <b>air.</b> Ambient <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and velocity profiles are presented around a variety of actuators {{in order to understand the}} nature of the induced flow for various parameters such as applied voltage, frequency, actuator geometry and material. It is found that the plasma actuator creates a laminar wall jet along the surface of the material on which it is placed. The second part of the study aims at using plasma actuators to reduce skin-friction drag in a fully developed turbulent boundary layer. Actuators are designed to induce spanwise forcing near the wall, oscillating in time. Thermal anemometry measurements within the boundary layer are presented. These show that the surface plasma can cause a skin-friction drag reduction of up to 45 % due to the creation of streamwise vortices which interact with, and disrupt the near-wall turbulence production cycle.

The alloys were then tested in cyclic oxidation in <b>static</b> <b>air</b> at <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 1000 to 1150 C at times from 500 to 100 1 hour cycles. Specific weight change {{with time and}} X-ray diffraction analyses of the oxidized samples were {{used to evaluate the}} alloys. The alloys tend to be either Al 2 O 3 /aluminate spinel or Cr 2 O 3 /chromite spinel formers depending on the Cr/Al ratio in the alloy. Waspaloy with a ratio of 15 : 1 is a strong Cr 2 O 3 former while this U- 700 with a ratio of 3. 33 : 1 tends to form mostly Cr 2 O 3 while Mar M- 247 with a ratio of 1. 53 : 1 is a strong Al 2 O 3 former. The best cyclic oxidation resistance is associated with the Al 2 O 3 formers. The cobalt levels appear to have little effect on the oxidation resistance of the Al 2 O 3 /aluminate spinel formers while any tendency to form Cr 2 O 3 is accelerated with increased cobalt levels and leads to increased oxidation attack...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a study of}} the optimal scheduling of building operation to minimize its energy cost under building operation uncertainties. Opposed to the usual way that describes thermal comfort using a <b>static</b> range of <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> the optimization of a tradeoff between energy cost and thermal comfort predicted mean vote (PMV) index is addressed in this paper. In order to integrate the calculation of the PMV index with the optimization procedure, we develop a sufficiently accurate approximation of the original PMV model which is computationally efficient. We develop a model-based periodic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) to handle the uncertainties in the building operation. Upon the triggering of predefined events, the ETM determines whether the optimal strategy should be recalculated. In this way, the communication and computational resources required can be significantly reduced. Numerical results show that the ETM method is robust with respect to the uncertainties in prediction errors and results in a reduction of more than 60 % in computation without perceivable degradation in system performance as compared to a typical closed-loop model predictive control...|$|R

Little scope exists to intelligently modify the ability of SRE walls to absorb and store heat energy simply by manipulation of particle size distribution (PSD) and the resultant bulk density/void ratio relationships, under these conditions.

40|$|Several {{investigators}} had determined that some atmospheric parameters {{were related to}} the formation and severity of microbursts. For example, Caracena pointed out the relationship between a dry adiabatic lapse rate and microbursts in 'The crash of Delta Flight 191 at Dallas-Fort Worth international airport'. These early investigations led to the idea that numeric modeling of microbursts with varying atmospheric parameters might define 'signatures' that could lead to determining the probability of microburst intensity. The idea was that, by using already available sensors (such as <b>static</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> pressure altitude, and radar reflectivity) onboard an aircraft, a reliable prediction of microburst existence and intensity could be formed. Such data could be used to create an 'expert meteorologist' using either artificial intelligence or other techniques {{that could be used in}} either reactive or look-ahead systems to vary sensitivity thresholds and coordinate the inputs from different detecting systems. To this end, Honeywell contracted to have the microburst simulations run. The questions to be addressed were the following: using the sensor set available to the aircraft (e. g. temperature, radar reflectivity, etc.), can we calculate the probability that (1) a microburst could be formed? and (2) that the resultant winds would be of sufficient magnitude to threaten the aircraft? Over a two year period, a data set of 1800 microburst simulations was accumulated. Verification of the microburst simulation was obtained using the results of other independent researchers and actual comparison to microburst events in Orlando and Denver. Some of the results from the simulation have already been incorporated into Honeywell's Windshear Detection and Guidance System with excellent results. Various aspects of this investigation are presented in viewgraph form...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensive}} {{deployment of}} UAVs for surveillance and reconnaissance missions {{during the last}} couple of decades has revealed their vulnerability to icing conditions. At present, a common icing avoidance strategy is simply not to fly when icing is forecast. Consequently, UAV missions in cold seasons and cold regions can be delayed for days when icing conditions persist. While this approach limits substantially the failure of UAV missions as a result of icing, there is obviously a need to develop all-weather capabilities. A key step in accomplishing this objective is to understand better the influence of a smaller geometry and a lower speed on the ice accretion process, relative to the extensively researched area of in-flight icing for traditional aircraft configurations characterized by high Reynolds number. Our analysis of the influence of Reynolds number on the ice accretion process is performed for the NACA 0012 airfoil. Analytical analysis of the integrated mass and energy balance equations along the airfoil surface allows the identification of regimes of rime and glaze formation, as well as the ice accretion extent as a function of <b>static</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and liquid water content. For each Reynolds number, a CFD solver computes the airflow field, and the distributions of Stanton number and static air pressure along the airfoil surface. Next, a drop trajectory solver computes the distribution of collection efficiency along the airfoil for a given drop size. Finally, a morphogenetic model is used to predict the ice accretion shape and its extent over the entire Reynolds number range under consideration. Our analysis highlights the differences between ice accretions on components of traditional aircraft and UAVs, arising from their differences in cruising speed and airfoil dimensions.

This study investigates UHTCs for use as potential combustion and aeropropulsion engine materials. These materials were oxidized in water vapor (90 %) using a cyclic vertical furnace at 1 atm. The total exposure time was 10 hours at temperatures of 1200, 1300, and 1400 C. CVD SiC was also evaluated as a baseline comparison. Weight change measurements, X-ray diffraction analyses, surface and cross-sectional SEM and EDS were performed.

Specific weight changes at all three temperatures along with the SIC results are shown. SiC weight change is negligible at such short duration times. HB 2 + SiC (HS) performed the best out of all the tested UHTCS for all exposure temperatures.
