5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

Of the 2,300 tanks and assault guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported to Hitler that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.|$|E

Galland hoped that the Me262 would compensate for the numerical <b>superiority</b> <b>of</b> the Allies. Lützow had been released from his position as fighter leader in Italy and Galland appointed him as his adjutant. Lützow was credited with two aerial victories flying the Me262.|$|E
