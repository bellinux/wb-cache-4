These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|Boris and Zeanah (1999), {{have offered}} an {{approach}} to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those {{where there is a}} distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the child has no attachment or no attachment to a specified attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. In <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> spacetime {{deviates}} from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism {{and the other}} fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E

5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|The final {{consideration}} is cost: {{how much will}} a particular defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> there is high herbivore pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.

5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Two-level {{utilitarian}}ism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a utilitarian {{theory of}} ethics developed by R. M. Hare.

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> {{the reduction in}} clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult.
