5|$|Floating point {{numbers are}} also <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> platform-specific range. They can be {{specified}} using floating point notation, or two forms of scientific notation.

5|$|Machines that {{generated}} static electricity {{with a glass}} disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740. In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the electric charge from these machines could be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} canonisation of the 120 Chinese Martyrs on 1 October 2000, the relics of sixteen {{of them were}} placed at the Chapel of Our Lord's Passion.

5|$|Smith {{operated}} his family's two {{dairy farms}} and a shop {{with his brother}} Frank {{in the village of}} Woolton. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith delivered milk by horse and cart in the Woolton area. The raw milk he provided was <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large churn and was ladled out into the bottles and receptacles of customers.|$|E

5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against the diamond with Lloyd's of London. The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated {{that it could}} only be publicly worn for thirty days in any given year, that it be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vault, and that Taylor was to be accompanied by armed guards when wearing it in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E
5|$|ATP synthase, {{also called}} complex V, {{is the final}} enzyme in the {{oxidative}} phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions {{in the same way}} in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the energy <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were {{designed}} with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with accommodations for an Admiral {{and his staff}} to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult amidships, and she could carry four aircraft which were <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.|$|E

5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E

5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored}} in more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E

5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these can be <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division {{by the use of}} 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
