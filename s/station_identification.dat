5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E

25|$|Due to Mexican {{government}} regulations, these stations, {{like all}} {{radio stations in}} Mexico, must air La Hora Nacional ("The Mexican National Hour") on Sunday evenings at 10pm and Himno Nacional Mexicano (the Mexican National Anthem) at midnight and 6 am. In addition, they must also give <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> in Spanish. This is usually done softly or during commercial breaks so the listeners on the American side won't usually notice it.|$|E

25|$|CBC-owned {{stations}} use call letters {{beginning with}} the combination CB (through a special agreement {{with the government of}} Chile); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as CTV Northern Ontario or Global Regina. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.|$|E

25|$|With {{the entry}} of France into World War II the same year, {{broadcasts}} ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and Telefunken, and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale (Vichy's radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of Fernsehsender Paris (Paris Télévision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5 hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, {{most of which were}} installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers, who photographed the <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> image direct from the screen.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are simulated sounds for the Silver Lake LFR. The range stationlocated about 10 {{miles north of}} Baker, Californiawould preempt the navigational signals [...] every 30 seconds to transmit its Morse code identifier ("RL"). The <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> would be heard once or twice, possibly with different relative amplitudes, depending on the aircraft location. Pilots would listen to and navigate by these sounds for hours while flying. Actual sounds contained [...] "static", interference and other distortions, not reproduced by the simulation. Adjusting the volume would affect the effective course width. For example, in the simulated sound for [...] "twilight" [...] A below, where the aircraft is nearly on the beam but slightly inside the A quadrant, a low volume almost obscures the weak A sound, whereas a loud one makes it more distinct.|$|E
500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Pedro Romhanyi, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} band in an all white room playing along to the track. A <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> logo for [...] "SFA television" [...] is seen in the top left and a green graphic appears, showing the volume level being turned up. The camera pans back to reveal a TV which switches channel from [...] "SFA" [...] to a station showing golf. The rest of the video continues this pattern, continually flicking between the band {{and a variety of other}} stations, which generally feature similar logos to real life channels but with slightly different names e.g. [...] "Cartoon Animals" [...] (Cartoon Network), [...] "CVQ" [...] (QVC), [...] "Animal Channel" [...] (Discovery Channel) Actors, news presenters, puppets, a golfer, an astronaut and weatherman sing along with the track as the television stops on the channel each appears on. At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera pans back to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to pan back showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera pans back through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire. A few seconds before the video ends the screen turns to static. The Pedro Romhanyi video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] single.|$|E

However, while drums {{may be used}} by griots singing praise songs or for inter-village communication, and other instruments may be used on the radio for <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> jingles, for regular conversation at a distance whistled speech is used. As two people approach each other, one may even switch from whistled to spoken speech in mid-sentence.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 2013, the CBC {{announced}} that it would be phasing out the Radio-Canada brand from its French-language broadcast properties, and unifying them under names prefixed with [...] "Ici" [...] ("here" [...] or [...] "this is"); for instance, the CBC planned to re-brand Télévision de Radio-Canada as [...] "Ici Télé", Première Chaîne as [...] "Ici Première", and move its French-language website from radio-canada.ca to ici.ca. Radio-Canada vice president Louis Lalande stated that the new name complemented its multi-platform operations, while also serving as an homage to the broadcaster's historic <b>station</b> <b>identification</b> slogan [...] "ici Radio-Canada" [...] ("this is Radio-Canada").|$|E
5000|$|One notable {{example of}} this in the 1990s was KJTV-34 in Lubbock, Texas.
