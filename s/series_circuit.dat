He officiated at his first Super 12 match in Sydney when the New South Wales Waratahs beat the Chiefs 25–7 in the opening round of the competition. Two more appearances followed – again in Sydney as the Waratahs faced the Crusaders and in Dunedin where the Highlanders hosted the Waratahs.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a <b>series</b> <b>circuit.</b> Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the <b>series</b> <b>circuit,</b> including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{variable}} threshold voltage CMOS (VTCMOS) in the <b>series</b> connected <b>circuits</b> are investigated {{by means of}} device simulation. It is newly found that the performance degradation due to the body effect in <b>series</b> connected <b>circuit</b> is suppressed by utilizing VTCMOS. Lowering the threshold voltage (Vth) enhances the drive current and alleviates the degradation due to the series connected configuration. Therefore, larger body effect factor (γ) results in lower Vth and higher on-current even in the <b>series</b> connected <b>circuits.</b> These characteristics are attributed to the velocity saturation phenomenon which reduces the drain saturation voltage (Vdsat).

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes always contain, {{in addition to}} the anode foil, a cathode foil that serves as electrical contact to the electrolyte. This cathode foil is provided with a very thin, natural, air-originated oxide layer, which act also as a dielectric. Thus, the capacitor construction forms a <b>series</b> <b>circuit</b> of two capacitors, the capacitance of the anode foil CA and the cathode foil CK. As described above, the capacitance of the capacitor Ce-cap is mainly determined by the anode capacitance CA when the cathode capacitance CK is approximately 10 times higher than the anode capacitance CA.|$|E
25|$|This {{extraordinary}} strong {{frequency dependence}} {{can be explained}} by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a <b>series</b> <b>circuit</b> of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E
