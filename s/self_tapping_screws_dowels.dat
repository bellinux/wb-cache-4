The structural composite panel system consists of profiled steel sheet attached to the dry board via mechanical self drilling and <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>screws.</b> Compared to traditional building systems and materials, the PSSDB system eliminates the used of conventional timber formworks, columns and roof trusses in buildings. Besides, the proposed system has many advantages {{such as it is}} lightweight, making construction less labour-orientated, shorter construction time, materials optimisation, and provides better finished products. The proposed panel system falls under the Industrialised Building System (IBS) category since all the structural panel components are manufactured in a factory, transported and assembled into a structure or building with minimal additional site work. The system was successfully implemented in two school classroom modules at Sekolah Kebangsaan Telok Mas, Melaka, Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|The Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) {{system is}} a thin-walled, {{lightweight}} composite structure consisting of Profiled Steel Sheeting connected to dry boards by means of <b>self</b> drilling, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>screws</b> and is a structural load bearing system. The size of {{the model of the}} wall selected is 3000 mm x 3000 mm x 78 mm. It is a square section with window opening section at 1200 mm x 1200 mm and symmetrically positioned {{in the center of the}} specimen. The study is based on the concept that the load bearing capacity of the composite wall is derived from the individual components, namely the profiled steel sheeting, dry board and the interaction between these two. Therefore, an analytical method is essential to predict the behaviour of the PSSDB system as walling unit with window opening. A linear finite element model has been developed to predict the full range of behaviour of PSSDB panel. LUSAS (1999), a finite element package (LUSAS version 13. 4) has been employed for this purpose. LUSAS pre-processing options provide on-screen modelling which include wide range of features like colour plots of deflection, stress and strain contours combining with different load cases...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{development}} in construction industry {{has resulted in}} increasing to demand for effective and innovative construction systems. Nowadays, construction no longer depends on current systems such as using timber bases and reinforcement concrete structures There are many problems with the current techniques such as high costing, low quality, and long construction time. One of the viable solution is to employ Industrialised Building System (IBS) which is a more efficient construction technology. Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB) is one type of Industrialised Building System (IBS). The PSSDB is a composite system that comprises of two main components which are profiled steel sheeting (PSS) and dry board (DB). They are attached by self drilling and <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>screws.</b> This research study {{about the effect of}} Primaflex dry board thickness towards the screw stiffness which has not been done before. The objectives of this study are to identify the screw stiffness using Primaflex dry board from push out test and to evaluate and also identify effect of Primaflex with different thicknesses. The results from this study have two parts which are effect of dry board from different thickness and effect of the screw. The result show that the Pnmaflex that has 9 mm of thickness has higher screw stiffness (0. 46 kN) than Primaflex that has 6 mm of thickness (0. 40 kN). Moreover, the result of an effect of the screw, the screw is easy to fail when the thickness of Primaflex is 6 mm more than Primaflex 9 mm. It is because, the hold between Peva and Primafl'ex is strong when the dry board is thick. As a conclusion, the thick board has a higher stiffness than thin board...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen an {{increasingly}} rapid development {{in the field of}} construction due to an initiative from the government to boot the economy and enhance the standard of living. However, these rapid changes result in many delayed and non-completion projects. Due to these matters, there is an extremely hih number of lost and cost in terms of wastage and pollution. One effective solution Is to implement the Industrialized Building System (IBS) such as the Profiled Steel Sheeting Diy Board (PSSDB). PSSDB is a composite structural panel consists of three elements which are the dry board, steel sheeting and <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> as connection. It {{can be used as a}} wall, roof or floor panel. This research studies the effect of dry -board thickness on the overall-floor panel stifThess. -Two -different thicknesses of Primaflex dry board; 6 mm and 9 mm, were used whilst the Peva 45 profiled steel sheeting thickness was maintained at 0. 8 mm. Bending tests were performed to identify the thickness that contributed to the higher stiffness of the floor panel. From the result, the maximum load for 6 mm and 9 mm boards are 24. 51 kN/m 2 and 27. 2 kN/m 2 respectively. The stiffness of the panels was also determined from the slope of the load versus the deflection graph. The stiffness value for the 6 mm board is 85 kNm 2 /m. In comparison, the stifffiess value of 9 mm Primaflex dry board is 89 kNm 2 /m. It can be concluded that the thicker the dry board, the stiffer the floor panel will be. The Primaflex dry board has shown to have a better bending flexibility and a potentially suitable dryboard choice in PSSDB...|$|R

The PSSDB is a light weight composite panel comprised of a profiled steel sheet PSS and cement board as dry board connected together by either mechanical fasteners or by epoxy adhesive resin. Ten push-out specimens with different size, shape, thickness of dry board, and types of connections were carried out. The ultimate load, the load slip relationship, and modes of failure were observed. The results showed that the samples connected by epoxy adhesive resin can sustain load greater than that connected by mechanical fasteners up to 76 %, and the ultimate load affected by the thickness of dry board. The capacity of connecter (<b>self</b> drilling-self <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> with 4. 2 mm diameter) is about 1. 736 kN/screw. This value increased by about 20 % with the increase in dryboard thickness to double (from 8 mm to 16 mm).

Materials and methods: Forty-six patients with We ber A and low Weber B displaced lateral malleolus fractures who underwent closed reduction and percutaneous internal fixation with an intramedullary, fully threaded, screw were retrospectively reviewed. A 3. 5 -mm, fully threaded, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> bone <b>screw</b> (stainless steel from Pelvic Set Synthes). The length of the screw varies between 100 mm and 120 mm, depending on the fracture location and pattern. Results: All fractures united within an average time to union of 8. 2 weeks. In all patients the average time to full weight bearing was 6. 8 weeks, whereas that in patients with isolated lat eral malleolus fractures was 4. 5 weeks. There were no deep wound infections or complaints of painful hardware. At latest follow-up, functional results were excellent in, 25 patients (54. 3 %) good in 20 (43. 5 %), fair in (2. 2 %). Conclu sion: If reduction of the lateral malleolus fracture can be obtained in a closed fashion (with the aid of an image x-ray intensifier), we believe that fixation may be performed with an axial screw percutaneously.

50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches.

Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the correlation of resonance frequency values and torque values of <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> and non-self-tapping dental implants and their different primary stability. Design: A group of 263 patients were treated with a total of 602 dental implants: 408 conical formed, non-self-tapping Ankylos® implants and 194 self-tapping Camlog® implants. The maximum insertion torque during implant placement was recorded. Resonance frequency was measured as the implant stability quotient (ISQ) once immediately after insertion and twice three months later. Results: After one year nine failures were observed (1. 5 %). Torque values of the non-self tapping implants were significantly higher than those in the <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> group (p= 0. 023). Resonance frequency values did not show differences between these two groups (p= 0. 956). Nevertheless, a correlation between ISQ values after implantation and three months after implant placement has been found (r= 0. 712; p< 0. 001). Within the implants systems, no correlation between insertion torque and resonance frequency values was observed (r= 0. 305; p= 0. 005).

40|$|Computer aided joint {{replacement}} surgery {{has become}} very popular during recent years and is being done in increasing numbers all over the world. The accuracy of the system depends to a major extent, on accurate registration and immobility of the tracker attachment devices to the bone. This {{study was designed to}} asses the forces needed to displace the tracker attachment devices in the bone simulators. Bone simulators were used to maintain the uniformity of the bone structure during the study. The fixation devices tested were 3 mm diameter <b>self</b> drilling, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> threaded pin, 4 mm diameter <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> cortical threaded pin, 5 mm diameter <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> cancellous threaded pin and a triplanar fixation device ‘ortholock’ used with three 3 mm pins. All the devices were tested for pull out, translational and rotational forces in unicortical and bicortical fixation modes. Also tested was the normal bang strength and forces generated by leaning on the devices. The forces required to produce translation increased with the increasing diameter of the pins. These were 105 N, 185 N, and 225 N for the unicortical fixations and 130 N, 200 N, 225 N for the bicortical fixations for 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins respectively. The forces required to pull out the pins were 1475 N, 1650 N, 2050 N for the unicortical, 1020 N, 3044 N and 3042 N for the bicortical fixated 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins. The ortholock translational and pull out strength was tested to 900 N and 920 N respectively and still it did not fail. Rotatory forces required to displace the tracker on pins was to the magnitude of 30 N before failure. The ortholock device had rotational forces applied up to 135 N and still did not fail. The manual leaning forces and the sudden bang forces generated were of the magnitude of 210 N and 150 N respectively. The strength of the fixation pins increases with increasing diameter from three to five mm for the translational forces. There is no significant difference in pull out forces of four mm and five mm diameter pins though it is more that the three mm diameter pins. This is because of the failure of material at that stage rather than the fixation device. The rotatory forces required to displace the tracker are very small and much less that that can be produced by the surgeon or assistants in single pins. Although the ortholock device was tested to 135 N in rotation without failing, one has to be very careful not to put any forces during the operation on the tracker devices to ensure the accuracy of the procedure. ...|$|R

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws.
