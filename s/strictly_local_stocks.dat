The limited number of types of features that a local feature extractor responds to might be insufficient to provide a robust image representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a context-aware feature extraction formulated under an information theoretic framework. The algorithm does not respond to {{a specific type of}} features; the idea is to retrieve complementary features which are relevant within the image context. We empirically validate the method by investigating the repeatability, the completeness, and the complementarity of context-aware features on standard benchmarks. In a comparison with <b>strictly</b> <b>local</b> features, we show that our context-aware features produce more robust image representations. Furthermore, we study the complementarity between <b>strictly</b> <b>local</b> features and context-aware ones to produce an even more robust representation...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{different aspects}} of capital liberalization {{and its impact on}} <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> market development. Specifically, it considers the consequences of opening <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> markets to foreign investors and the effects of allowing local companies to access foreign stock markets. ^ The first chapter provides a thorough and in-depth examination of the consequences of allowing foreign investors direct access to domestic stock markets. By using capital liberalization measures that are specifically relevant to international equity investors, and by taking into account variations in the extent of liberalization (across countries and over time), we attempt to unearth the effects of foreign investor participation on <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> market size and liquidity (as well as on qualitative aspects of market development). Using cross-country and panel data regression models, we find that there is some evidence of a positive impact on the size and liquidity of stock markets from equity market liberalization. Though the results from the cross-country analysis are somewhat affected by the time period considered, the panel analysis provide more robust support for our conclusions. We also indicate the possibility of qualitative improvements to stock markets in the presence of foreign investors. ^ The second chapter focuses on the effects to <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> markets from extending indirect access to foreign equity investors. We examine the impact of international cross-listings on <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> exchanges by focusing on the experience of Chile. First, we analyze the consequences to the domestically traded shares of a sample of Chilean companies that undertook ADR listings. Our findings show that there is no indication of order-flow migration from the domestic market following cross-listings. There is, however, evidence that in the aftermath of cross-listings trading becomes concentrated in the ADR market. There is also some indication of an increase in the base-level price volatility of the underlying stock series following cross-listings. Second, we study the changes in Chile 2 ̆ 7 s <b>local</b> <b>stock</b> market vis-à-vis the ADR market. We observe that the increase in the size and liquidity of the domestic stock exchange is overshadowed by the rapid growth of the ADR market. ...|$|R
40|$|Heinz, JeffreyThis {{dissertation}} identifies {{a strong}} computational property of phonological and morphological processes with local triggers. It is {{shown that the}} input-output mapping that underlies these processes can be modeled with <b>Strictly</b> <b>Local</b> (SL) functions, a previously undefined class of subregular relations. The SL functions, which are divided into two proper subclasses of subsequential functions (the Input SL functions and Output SL functions) are given an automata-theoretic characterization by combining the properties of subsequential transduction (Mohri, 1997) and the <b>Strictly</b> <b>Local</b> formal languages (McNaughton and Papert, 1971; Rogers and Pullum, 2011; Rogers et al., 2013). Importantly, the property of strict locality is independent of and compatible with both rule- and constraint-based grammatical formalisms, since it holds of the input-output mappings that both formalisms describe. The range of processes that are shown to be <b>Strictly</b> <b>Local</b> includes substitution, deletion, insertion, synchronic metathesis, local partial reduplication, and general affixation. This computational property aids in identifying the set of 'phonologically possible' processes within the larger set of logically possible processes. In addition, a learning algorithm that provably learns the class of ISL functions by using strict locality as an inductive principle is presented. These combined contributions to typology and learning demonstrate how computational analysis can enhance {{our understanding of the}} nature of locality in phonological processes.

On average, the dollar value of the equity market declines by less than the currency devaluation, and devaluations typically have a more negative effect on developing country stock markets.
