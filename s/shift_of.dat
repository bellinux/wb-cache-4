This is {{stronger}} than the (more obvious) statement that the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> a pseudo-spline form a Riesz system. In fact, the linear independence of a compactly supported (refinable) function and its shifts has been studied in several areas of approximation and wavelet theory (see e. g. [4], [9], [10], [13], [14], [16] and [19]). Furthermore, the linear independence <b>of</b> the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> a pseudo-spline is a necessary and sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} a compactly supported function whose shifts form a biorthogonal dual system <b>of</b> the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> the pseudo-spline. 1...|$|R

5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> their motion in flight. The Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{endogenous}} (cue-directed) attention {{have traditionally}} assumed that such shifts must be volitional. However, recent behavioural experiments {{have shown that}} participants make automatic endogenous <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> attention when presented with symbolic cues that are systematically associated with particular spatial directions, such as arrows and numerals, even when such cues were not behaviourally relevant. Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to test whether these automatic <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> attention use the same mechanisms as volitional <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> attention. We presented participants with non-predictive (50 % valid) task-irrelevant arrow and numeral cues while measuring cue- and target-locked ERPs. Although the cues were task-irrelevant, they elicited attention-related ERP components previously found in studies that used informative and/or task-relevant cues. These findings further substantiate the dissociation between endogenous and volitional attentional control, and suggest that the same fronto-parietal networks involved in volitional <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> attention are also involved in reflexive endogenous <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> attention.
