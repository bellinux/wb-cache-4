5000|$|Analysts were {{concerned}} that the political gridlock would extend into mid-October, when Congress and the President must agree to raise the debt ceiling to avoid the prospect of defaulting on the public debt. Following {{the debate over the}} debt ceiling in May 2013, the Treasury Department was forced to engage in extraordinary measures to fund the government. In August 2013, the Treasury informed Congress that the extraordinary measures would be insufficient starting in mid-October and further specified, in late September, that the U.S. would begin to default on its debts if a new debt ceiling was not approved by October 17. On October 2, President Obama explicitly linked the government shutdown to the debt ceiling issue, stating that he would not reopen budget negotiations until Republicans agreed to passage of a bill raising the debt limit. On October 7, the Moody's bond credit rating agency released a memo stating that it was unlikely the U.S. would risk a default on its public debt, and that the nation instead [...] "would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt". The memo further stated that the financial situation was more serious in 2011 than the 2013 problem. However, such prioritizing of debt payments over all other needs would require that the government default on many other payment obligations, likely including a wide array of business contracts, employee salaries, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits,</b> and other programs. The Council on Foreign Relations said that among the payments implicated were military wages, Medicare and Social Security payments, and unemployment support.|$|E

The paper looks at the Japanese tax and social security systems through an extended life-cycle general equilibrium simulation model.

Therefore, in this paper the weight parameter is estimated based on a RIETI questionnaire survey on the optimal burden in Japan.

The results also suggest that, with regard to the total amount of the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> or that of the national burden, in the long run substantial differences will develop between cases where the income replacement ratio in the public pension program is maintained at the present level and where the contribution rate is capped in accordance with the government's current pension schedule. ...|$|R

40|$|Background High {{school dropout}} and {{problematic}} work integration in young adulthood represent an individual hazard and a societal challenge in most Western countries. Health problems with varying degree of functional limitations {{are common in}} adolescence, {{and there is some}} evidence to suggest a higher risk of sickness and disability among high school dropouts compared to high school completers. Prospective studies of the complex role of adolescent health, socioeconomic factors and family context for completion of secondary school and subsequent problematic labour market integration due to ill health are rare. Aims The main objective of the thesis was to study, with a prospective design, the associations between adolescent health, high school dropout and long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> in young adulthood. We investigated whether adolescent health and health-related vulnerability confounded the association between school dropout and long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits.</b> We studied the associations between several dimensions of self-reported health in adolescence and school dropout. For all these associations, we assessed the contribution of socioeconomic factors and the family context. Methods Our study population was 8795 school attending adolescents (13 - 21 years) who participated in the Young-Hunt 1 Survey in the county Nord-Trøndelag, Norway (1995 - 1997). The information of the questionnaire was combined with national register based information on education and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> from 1998 to 2007 / 2008. High school dropout or completion was defined with the Norwegian National Education Database (NUDB) in the calendar year the participant turned 24 years old. We recorded long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits,</b> such as long-term (more than 180 days/calendar year) sickness absence, rehabilitation benefits, disability benefits, long-term unemployment, and social insurance support in the Norwegian Labour and Welfare registers (FD-Trygd). Parental information on socioeconomic position and linkage of siblings was obtained by the NUDB, FD-Trygd and the HUNT 2 survey. The main adolescent health exposures from Young-Hunt 1 Survey were chronic somatic disease, somatic symptoms, psychological distress, concentration difficulties, insomnia, self-reported health and overweight. Common risk factors that could confound the association between dropout and benefits were the various adolescent health dimensions, health-related behaviours, psychosocial factors, school problems, and parental socioeconomic position. Health-related vulnerability for dropout was estimated with a propensity score for high school dropout based on these common risk factors. We assessed the associations between the different adolescent health dimensions and school dropout, and between school dropout and long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> with descriptive statistics and various logistic regression models, both in the whole population and among siblings. Results In the Young-HUNT 1 cohort, a total of 17 % was registered as high school dropouts at age 24. The predicted 5 -year risk for receiving long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> between ages 24 - 28 was 21 % (95 % CI 20 % to 23 %). High school dropouts had about a 3 -fold higher risk for receiving long-term benefits and poor self-rated health was associated with receiving both medical and non-medical benefits in the models adjusted for parental socioeconomic position. (Paper I) All explored health dimensions were strongly associated with high school dropout, also in the models adjusted for parental socioeconomic position. The results were confirmed in the analyses comparing differentially exposed siblings, with the exception for chronic somatic disease and psychological distress. School dropout was strongly clustered within families. (Paper II) High school dropouts have a strongly increased risk for long-term sickness benefits and disability pension between ages 24 - 29 across all vulnerability or risk factor level for school dropout, i. e. independent of own health, family and socioeconomic factors in adolescence. Strong associations between dropout and receipt of benefits were also present when comparing siblings. (Paper III) Conclusions High school dropout and receipt of long-term <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefits</b> in young adulthood are substantive problems both for the individual and society. All examined dimensions of health in adolescence were associated with school dropout. High school dropout increased the risk for sickness and disability regardless of the risk factor level present for school dropout. Although the family context was very important for both dropout and receipt of benefits, most associations were confirmed in sibling comparisons. Future research on educational attainment and labour market exclusion in young adulthood should also have attention to health-related mechanisms. For policy, our findings support the importance of prevention of school dropout where possible, in combination with increased attention to labour market integration and targeted support for those who fail to complete high school. The results also support that adolescent health should have a central role in public health policy. nrpages: 120 status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|Psychological {{distress}} is {{a well-known}} factor influencing QOL [12, 15]. The low HRQOL rating in comparison with healthy samples was an expected result due to the cancer experience [10, 11, 18, 20, 21, 30]. Lower socioeconomic status may influence HRQOL in children with cancer, but the results are not conclusive [15, 30]. In this study, we analysed the level of parental education and determined whether the parents were employed or unemployed, {{but we did not}} consider their socioeconomic status. In Argentina, in comparison with Sweden, more parents were unemployed, but they still reported fewer problems of cancer-related fatigue; facts which were also reported by their children. In Sweden, children whose mothers had post-secondary education stated fewer cancer-related problems [30]. There are obvious differences between the countries. In Sweden, when a child is seriously ill both parents can be off work at the same time, paid by <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> days. Such an opportunity is lacking in Argentina. Your burden is great if you are unemployed while a parent to a child with cancer, and these circumstances will probably cause a high level of distress [35], and increase your level of fatigue, although this was not conveyed in the current study. However, if parents and children consider fatigue as an inevitable consequence of treatment they may not report the severity of the problem, nor emphasize approaches to reduce it [36].|$|R
