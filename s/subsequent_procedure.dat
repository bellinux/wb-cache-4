40|$|ObjectiveMultiple <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> {{directed}} at the arch and/or the left ventricular outflow tract are frequently required after interrupted aortic arch repair. We the investigated patterns and factors associated with these <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> and mortality. MethodsWe reviewed the data from 447 patients with interrupted aortic arch at 33 institutions enrolled from 1987 to 1997. We classified the <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> by type (catheter-based or surgical) and focus (arch, left ventricular outflow tract, and “other” cardiovascular lesions). We used competing risks and modulated renewal analysis to explore <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures.</b> ResultsThere were 158 subsequent arch and 100 left ventricular outflow tract procedures. Freedom from death at 21 years was 60 % overall. The risk of additional <b>subsequent</b> arch <b>procedures</b> decreased after the first <b>subsequent</b> arch <b>procedure</b> in the acute phase, but did not significantly change in the chronic phase. The risk of additional subsequent left ventricular outflow tract procedures increased after the first subsequent left ventricular outflow tract procedure in the chronic phase. The risk factors for <b>subsequent</b> arch <b>procedures</b> and mortality, but not for <b>subsequent</b> outflow track <b>procedures,</b> were related in a complex way to previous procedures and their timing. ConclusionsInterrupted aortic arch is a chronic disease in which patients often undergo multiple <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> with persistent risk for additional intervention and mortality. The risk factors {{are related to the}} nature and timing of previous procedures and to the morphology and details of the index procedure. Interrupted aortic arch should be considered a chronic disorder...|$|R

5000|$|In music {{information}} retrieval, {{techniques have}} been developed to determine the key of a piece of classical Western music (recorded in audio data format) automatically.

Although a radical (over)simplification of the concept of tonality, such methods can predict the key of classical Western music well for most pieces. Other methods also take into consideration the sequentiality of music.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) {{reported}} that endovascular coiling yields better clinical outcomes than surgical clipping at 1 year. The {{high cost of}} the consumables associated with the endovascular coiling procedure (particularly the coils) led health care purchasers to conclude that coiling was a more costly procedure overall. To examine this assumption and provide evidence for future policy, accurate and comprehensive data are required on the overall resource usage and cost of each strategy. METHODS: We provide detailed results of patient treatment pathways, resource utilization, and costs up to 24 months postrandomization for endovascular and neurosurgical treatment of aSAH. We report data on costs related to initial and <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> (ward days, ITU, equipment, staff, consumables, etc), adverse events, complications, and follow up. The data {{are based on a}} subsample of all patients randomized in ISAT, containing all patients across 22 UK centers (n= 1644). RESULTS: There was a nonsignificant difference - pound 1740 (- pound 3582 to pound 32) in the total 12 -month cost of treatment in favor of endovascular treatment. Endovascular patients had higher costs than neurosurgical patients for the initial procedure, for the number and length of stay of <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures,</b> and for follow-up angiograms. These were more than offset by lower costs related to length of stay for the initial procedure. In the following 12 - to 24 -month period, costs for <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures,</b> angiograms, complications, and adverse events were greater for the endovascular patients, reducing the difference in total per patient cost to - pound 1228 (- pound 3199 to pound 786) over the first 24 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in costs between the endovascular and neurosurgery groups existed at 12 - or 24 -month follow up...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the impact of endoscopist fatigue on quality of endoscopy performance by comparing outcomes based on chronological procedure order. Consecutive endoscopic procedures were prospectively observed. Quality indicators of colonoscopy (cecal intubation rate, lesion detection, withdrawal time, insertion time) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) duration were compared among procedures based on their chronological sequence. Colonoscopy completion rates declined with successive procedures; completion for 1 st to 3 rd procedures (90 %) was significantly higher than for 4 th and <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> (76 %) (P = 0. 03). Median insertion times lengthened; times for 1 st to 4 th procedures [8 min, interquartile range (IQR) 6 - 11 min] were shorter than for 5 th and <b>subsequent</b> <b>procedures</b> (10 min, IQR 7 - 15 min) (P = 0. 06). Lesion detection rates, withdrawal times, and EGD duration remained stable with procedure order. Colonoscopy cecal intubation rates appear to decline with successive procedures. There also appears to be a trend for insertion times to lengthen. Reassuringly, other quality indicators of colonoscopy (lesion detection and withdrawal time) and EGD duration do not appear to be impacted by repetitive procedures...|$|R
