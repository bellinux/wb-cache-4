5000|$|In linguistics, veridicality is a {{semantic}} or grammatical assertion {{of the truth}} of an utterance. For example, the statement [...] "Paul saw a snake" [...] asserts the truthfulness of the claim, while [...] "Paul did <b>see</b> <b>a</b> snake" [...] is an even stronger assertion. Negation is veridical, though of opposite polarity, sometimes called antiveridical: [...] "Paul didn't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> snake" [...] asserts that the statement [...] "Paul saw a snake" [...] is false. In English, non-indicative moods are frequently used in a nonveridical sense: [...] "Paul may have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> snake" [...] and [...] "Paul would have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> snake" [...] do not assert that Paul actually saw a snake (and the second implies that he did not), though [...] "Paul would indeed have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> snake" [...] is veridical, and some languages have separate veridical conditional moods for such cases.|$|R
