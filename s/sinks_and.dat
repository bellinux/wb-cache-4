5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|An {{outstanding}} problem {{concerning the}} physics governing the narrow Uranian rings is their confinement. Without some mechanism {{to hold their}} particles together, the rings would quickly spread out radially. The lifetime of the Uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1million years. The most widely cited model for such confinement, proposed initially by Goldreich and Tremaine, is that a pair of nearby moons, outer and inner shepherds, interact gravitationally with a ring and act like <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> donors, respectively, for excessive and insufficient angular momentum (or equivalently, energy). The shepherds thus keep ring particles in place, but gradually {{move away from the}} ring themselves. To be effective, the masses of the shepherds should exceed the mass of the ring by at least a factor of two to three. This mechanism is known to be at work {{in the case of the}} ε ring, where Cordelia and Ophelia serve as shepherds. Cordelia is also the outer shepherd of the δ ring, and Ophelia is the outer shepherd of the γ ring. However no moon larger than 10km is known in the vicinity of other rings. The current distance of Cordelia and Ophelia from the ε ring can be used to estimate the ring’s age. The calculations show that the ε ring cannot be older than 600 million years.|$|E

50|$|Degradation of IDSS by gate <b>sinking</b> <b>and</b> {{hydrogen}} poisoning. This {{failure is}} the most common and easiest to detect, and is affected by reduction of the active channel of the transistor in gate <b>sinking</b> <b>and</b> depletion of the donor density in the active channel for hydrogen poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Without proper cooling, {{a modern}} {{processor}} chip can rapidly reach temperatures that {{cause it to}} malfunction. Even with a common heat <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> fan attached, typical processor operating temperatures may still reach up to 70 °C (160 °F). A thermosiphon can efficiently transfer heat over a much wider temperature range and can typically maintain the processor temperature 10-20 °C cooler than a traditional heat <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> fan. In some cases, {{it is also possible}} that a thermosiphon may be more compact than an appropriately sized conventional heat <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> fan.|$|R
25|$|Oceans are {{at present}} CO2 <b>sinks,</b> <b>and</b> {{represent}} the largest active carbon sink on Earth, absorbing {{more than a}} quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air. The solubility pump is the primary mechanism responsible for the CO2 absorption by the oceans.|$|E

25|$|Copper and {{aluminium}} {{are used}} as heat <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> heat pipes in electronic cooling applications. A heat sink is a passive component that cools semiconductor and optoelectronic devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding air. Heat sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by convection, radiation, and conduction.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{food and}} damaged facilities, {{a group of}} NS {{trainees}} from the White Resort camp, Balik Pulau, Penang, protested and threatened to leave the camp over unbearable conditions of the camp such as insufficient food, dirty pillows, clogged <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> toilets, broken bed frames and broken toilet doors. One of the NS trainees found worms in the food served at the camp.|$|E
25|$|In the {{short-lived}} British period drama Lilies (TV series), {{the brother of}} the protagonists is discharged from the military during World War One after his boat <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> he {{is one of a handful}} of shell shocked survivors. Billy gets sent and given numerous white feathers for his perceived cowardice, and begins to hallucinate them choking him. This is a recurring theme throughout the series.|$|E
50|$|The battle ensign {{was seen}} as an {{important}} element for the morale of the crew and was held in high regard.

25|$|Hot springs: Hot springs such as Grand Prismatic Spring are {{the most}} common {{hydrothermal}} features in the park. Their plumbing has no constrictions. Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, <b>sinks,</b> <b>and</b> is replaced by hotter water from below. This circulation, called convection, prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption. Many hot springs give rise to streams of heated water.|$|E
25|$|The longest known {{underwater}} cave {{system in}} the USA, The Leon Sinks cave system, near Tallahassee, Florida, has multiple interconnected <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> springs spanning two counties (Leon & Wakulla). One main resurgence of the system, Wakulla Springs, is explored exclusively by a very successful and pioneering project called the Woodville Karst Plain Project (WKPP), although other individuals and groups like the US Deep Cave Diving Team, have explored portions of Wakulla Springs in the past.|$|E
25|$|Accommodation {{is usually}} {{provided}} for all undergraduates, {{and for some}} graduates, although some accommodation is off-site. Accommodation is generally spacious with most rooms equipped with <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> fridges. Many undergraduate rooms comprise 'sets' of bedrooms and living areas. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal (where gowns must be worn and Latin grace is read). The buttery next to the Hall serves drinks around dinner time. There is also a college bar (known as the Undercroft), {{as well as a}} Junior Common Room (JCR) and a Graduate Common Room (GCR).|$|E

25|$|Heat production: The {{ever-increasing}} {{density of}} MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial localized heat generation that can impair circuit operation. Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures, and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes. Heat <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors. Power MOSFETs {{are at risk}} of thermal runaway. As their on-state resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|The banded tunnelweb spider is not {{dangerous}} to humans, although its bite can be painful; its poison {{does not affect}} people and will only cause some soreness and inflammation. Although large in size, the banded tunnelweb spider is extremely shy. Male banded tunnelweb spiders are sometimes found in <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> bathtubs, as they may wander inside a home in search for a mate, fall in and become trapped. It is during this time when males are searching for a mate that they are most commonly seen. Although the bite from the banded tunnelweb spider does not cause any severe health complications for humans, it is very {{closely related to the}} Australian funnelweb spider, which can be dangerous. Throughout the world there are 85 known species of tunnelweb spider, 25 of those are found in New Zealand.|$|E
