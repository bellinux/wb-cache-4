40|$|Work force {{scheduling}} research {{over the}} last few years has concentrated on the shift scheduling problem in service oriented firms (telephone operators, postal employees, bank encoders, etc.). In all cases, the authors were primarily interested in the evaluating procedures (optimal and heuristic) to determine the appropriate number of workers to be assigned to the available set of work schedules to meet fluctuating work volumes. However, more attention should be given to how the available shift schedules were defined (start times, durations, etc.) and their impact on maintaining good productivity levels. This paper analyzes the impact of six different approaches in defining the available weekly tour-shift schedules. Tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the six approaches using operating data from Ohio National Bank for the check proof and encoding activity. The results of this study provide some useful managerial insights into the issues of effectively staffing personnel on a weekly basis. First, restrictive employment policies/customs can substantially increase costs. Second, <b>structured</b> <b>procedures</b> can be used to identify and build good employment schedules for a weekly assignment.

Daily {{medical practice}} includes {{instances in which}} “leaping: from one patient management routine to another is a must. We define “frozen patient management:, when patient management leaping was required but was not performed. Frozen patient management may cause significant damage to patient safety and health and the treatment quality. This paper discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of GPP-guided medical practice and gives an explanation of the problem of frozen patient management in light of quality engineering, control engineering, and learning processes. Our analysis of frozen patient management is based on consideration of medical care as a process. By considering medical care processes as a closed-loop control process, it is possible to explain why, when an indication for deviation from the expected occurs, it does not necessarily attract the medical teams&# 39; attention, thereby preventing the realization that leaping to an alternative patient management is needed. We suggest that working according to GPPs intensifies the frozen patient management problem since working according to GPPs relates to “exploitation learning behavior”, while leaping to new patient management relates to “exploration learning behavior”. We indicate practice routines to be incorporated into GPP-guided medical care, to reduce frozen patient management.

40|$|The {{research}} project {{described in this}} thesis concentrates on the study, and application of specific channel coding techniques, in particular, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, iterative decoding on Tanner graphs, and their application on joint iterative receivers based on the turbo principle, previously proposed. The construction of random LDPC codes that fulfil certain desirable characteristics, such as large girth, specific p and -y values, and acceptable BER and FER performance for short code lengths, traditionally requires {{a high degree of}} processing power (i. e. CPU cycles) to run stochastic routines that firstly search within all the possible combinations for those ones that match the desired characteristics of the LDPC matrix, and secondly determines the bit-error rate (BER) and frame-error rate (FER) performance. The construction of well structured LDPC codes by means of algebraic methods has provided LDPC codes that achieve excellent performance, with desirable structure on their LDPC matrices. However, from the universe of LDPC matrices, those ones created through well <b>structured</b> <b>procedures</b> are a small group. Multiple procedures to modify their characteristics such as length and rate have assisted to increase the pool of LDPC codes based on well <b>structured</b> <b>procedures.</b> This thesis study the problem of constructing random LDPC codes with particular length, girth, and column weight as design parameters, with reduced processing power, while providing, at the same time, a desirable structure to allow efficient use of the memory and of the parallel processing capacity to reduce delay through efficient encoding and decoding. Based on previous studies that analysed the same problem, an algorithm is introduced to construct the Girth-Partition and Shift (GPS) LDPC codes, which are half-rate quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes. Several GPS constructions are analysed over the AWGN channel and the flat-fading channel. The effect on the BER and FER performance from variations on their design parameters, is included in this study. This work also includes the BER and FER performance of the concatenation in parallel of different LDPC codes, some of which are based on well <b>structured</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as Euclidean Geometries (EG) and Projective Geomtries (PG), and Margulis constructions based on the Cayley graph, while the rest are based on random procedures, such as Graphical Models (GM) and GPS-LDPC codes. The aim of the analysis of this scheme, combined with the referred LDPC code constructions, include the improvement of the BER and FER performance for short code lengths and the reduction of the encoding complexity. The BER and FER performance achieved by the parallel concatenation of the previously mentioned LDPC codes, is further analysed in a joint demapping, parallel channel decoding and source decoding system. The impact of each component on the overall system performance is also examined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the nature of}} "best practice" recruitment and selection in the hotel sector. Data from a sample of Scottish hotels indicate a reliance on informal methods, particularly in smaller hotels. In larger and chain hotels, <b>structured</b> <b>procedures,</b> including references, application forms and panel interviews, are evident, but, here too, these methods seem inadequate for dealing with recruitment and quality problems, especially in meeting temporary staffing needs. Case study evidence contrasts two alternative strategies: a successful holistic strategy based on management of social processes important for selection, and a more conventional bureaucratic strategy. Each strategy depends on a complex interrelationship between business and labour market considerations, the ownership and management structure of the hotel, and the tenure and experience of those responsible for selection. This evidence indicates that, for the hotel industry, the holistic strategy is an alternative to conventional notions...|$|E

A major source of procedural {{knowledge is}} natural language instructions. While these readable instructions have been useful learning resources for human, they are not interpretable by machines. Automatically acquiring procedural knowledge in machine interpretable formats from instructions has become an increasingly popular research topic due to their potential applications in process automation. However, it has been insufficiently addressed. This paper presents an approach and an implemented system to assist users to automatically acquire procedural knowledge in structured forms from instructions.

The method is evaluated in three domains to justify the generality of the proposed semantic representation as well as the effectiveness of the implemented automatic system...|$|E
