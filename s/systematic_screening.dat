Lipids though have rarely been studied in large-scale interaction screen; they are poorly represented in current biological networks. Here, we describe the use of miniaturized lipid–arrays for the large-scale study of protein–lipid interactions. In yeast, we show general feasibility with a <b>systematic</b> <b>screen</b> implying 172 proteins. We report 530 protein–lipid associations, the majority is novel and several were validated using other techniques. The screen uncovers numerous insights into lipid function in yeast and equivalent systems in humans. It revealed (i) previously undetected cryptic lipid-binding domains, (ii) series of new cellular targets for sphingolipids and (iii) new ligands for some PH domains that can cooperatively bind additional lipids and work as coincidence sensor to integrate both phosphatidylinositol phosphates and sphingolipid signaling pathways. The significant number of biological insights uncovered shows that even major classes of metabolites have been insufficiently studied.

40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} {{has enabled}} genetic screens that can rapidly identify mutations that occur during experimental evolution. The {{presence of a}} mutation in an evolved lineage does not, however, constitute proof that the mutation is adaptive, given the well-known and widespread phenomenon of genetic hitchhiking, in which a non-adaptive or even detrimental mutation can co-occur in a genome with a beneficial mutation and the combined genotype is carried to high frequency by selection. We approximated the spectrum of possible beneficial mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using sets of single-gene deletions and amplifications of almost all the genes in the S. cerevisiae genome. We determined the fitness effects of each mutation in three different nutrient-limited conditions using pooled competitions followed by barcode sequencing. Although most of the mutations were neutral or deleterious, ~ 500 of them increased fitness. We then compared those results to the mutations that actually occurred during experimental evolution in the same three nutrient-limited conditions. On average, ~ 35 % of the mutations that occurred during experimental evolution were predicted by the <b>systematic</b> <b>screen</b> to be beneficial. We found that the distribution of fitness effects depended on the selective conditions. In the phosphate-limited and glucose-limited conditions, {{a large number of}} beneficial mutations of nearly equivalent, small effects drove the fitness increases. In the sulfate-limited condition, one type of mutation, the amplification of the high-affinity sulfate transporter, dominated. In the absence of that mutation, evolution in the sulfate-limited condition involved mutations in other genes that were not observed previously-but were predicted by the <b>systematic</b> <b>screen.</b> Thus, gross functional screens have the potential to predict and identify adaptive mutations that occur during experimental evolution...|$|R

5000|$|Chemogenomics, or {{chemical}} genomics, is the <b>systematic</b> <b>screening</b> of targeted chemical libraries of small molecules against individual drug target families (e.g., GPCRs, nuclear receptors, kinases, proteases, etc.) {{with the ultimate}} goal of identification of novel drugs and drug targets. [...] Typically some members of a target library have been well characterized where both the function has been determined and compounds that modulate the function of those targets (ligands in the case of receptors, inhibitors of enzymes, or blockers of ion channels) have been identified. Other members of the target family may have unknown function with no known ligands and hence are classified as orphan receptors. By identifying screening hits that modulate the activity of the less well characterized members of the target family, the function of these novel targets can be elucidated. Furthermore, the hits for these targets {{can be used as a}} starting point for drug discovery. The completion of the human genome project has provided an abundance of potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Adopting <b>systematic</b> <b>screening</b> can be a cost-effective strategy for programs to offer more services and thus to improve women’s and children’s health. <b>Systematic</b> <b>screening</b> is a USAID best practice. In a <b>systematic</b> <b>screening</b> strategy, health care providers first identify each client’s needs and desires for services using a checklist or brief questionnaire (see Figure 1). Then they provide these services—during the same visit, through a separate appointment at the same health facility, or through referral to another facility. Most women attending health facilities have multiple needs for reproductive and child health services. These may include family planning, well-baby care, nutritional assessments, and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Conventionally, however, health care providers deliver only the service requested by the client and do not attempt to identify the client’s other needs. Also, clients may be unaware that they need additional services or that the services are available. In either case the client often leaves the facility with unmet reproductive health needs, while the provider misses an opportunity to provide services that could improve health...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{aim upon}} {{completion}} of whole genome sequences is the functional analysis of all predicted genes. We have applied a high-throughput RNA-interference (RNAi) screen of 19, 470 double-stranded (ds) RNAs in cultured cells to characterize the function of nearly all (91 %) predicted Drosophila genes in cell growth and viability. We found 438 dsRNAs that identified essential genes, among which 80 % lacked mutant alleles. A quantitative assay of cell number was applied to identify genes of known and uncharacterized functions. In particular, we demonstrate a role for the homolog of a mammalian acute myeloid leukemia gene (AML 1) in cell survival. Such a <b>systematic</b> <b>screen</b> for cell phenotypes, such as cell viability, can thus be effective in characterizing functionally related genes on a genome-wide scale...|$|R

40|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>screening</b> {{is often}} {{proposed}} {{as a way}} to improve case finding for tuberculosis (TB), but the cost-effectiveness of specific strategies for <b>systematic</b> <b>screening</b> remains poorly studied. We constructed a Markov-based decision analytic model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of triage testing for TB in Uganda, compared against passive case detection with Xpert MTB/RIF. We assumed a triage algorithm whereby all adults presenting to healthcare centres would be screened for cough, and those with cough of at least 2  weeks would receive the triage test, with positive triage results confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF. We adopted the perspective of the TB control sector, using a primary outcome of the cost per year of life gained (YLG) over a lifetime time horizon. <b>Systematic</b> <b>screening</b> in a population with a 5 % underlying prevalence of TB was estimated to cost US$ 610 per YLG (95 % uncertainty range US$ 200 -US$ 1859) with chest X-ray (CXR) (US$ 5 per test, specificity 0. 67), or US$ 588 (US$ 221 -US$ 1746) with C reactive protein (CRP) (US$ 3 per test, specificity 0. 59). In addition to the cost and specificity of the triage test, cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the underlying prevalence of TB, monthly risk of mortality in people with untreated TB and the proportion of patients with TB who would be treated in the absence of <b>systematic</b> <b>screening.</b> To optimise the cost-effectiveness of facility-based <b>systematic</b> <b>screening</b> of TB with a triage test, it must be carried out in a high-risk population, or use triage tests that are cheaper or more specific than CXR or CRP...|$|E

30|$|How do we {{go further}} in {{understanding}} proteasome phosphorylation? The simple answer {{is that we need}} to go broader and go deeper. On one hand, previous research on proteasome phosphorylation has been isolated and mostly relied candidate approaches. More <b>systematic</b> <b>screens</b> are needed to identify kinases and phosphatases that regulate proteasome activity and phosphorylation profile. Libraries of cDNAs, shRNAs, sgRNAs, and small-molecule inhititors are readily available for this purpose and have been successfully used (Chou and Deshaies, 2011; Guo et al., 2016). Knowledge about proteasome kinases and phosphatases is instrumental because it not only allows for direct manipulation of proteasome phosphorylation for biochemical analysis in vitro and in vivo, but also helps to elucidate the biological meaning of proteasome phosphorylation by connecting it with signaling pathways and cellular activities.|$|R
