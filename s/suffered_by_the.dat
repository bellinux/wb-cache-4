5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{personnel}} {{also took}} part in the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces {{until the end of the}} war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Allied air forces during the fighting in Normandy and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to the fighting in Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Ilyushin began {{construction}} of another prototype to evaluate this solution {{and this was}} endorsed on 16 October 1954 when the Council of Ministers ordered production to begin at Factory (Zavod) No. 168 at Rostov-on-Don of the improved version, designated as the Il-40P. The Il-40P prototype first flew on 14 February 1955 and began State acceptance trials on 12 October 1955. The changes had resolved all the problems <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> earlier design and an order for a first batch of forty production machines was placed.|$|E

5|$|In all, 45 Israelis were killed, 50 were wounded, and 5 {{captured}} by Egypt. Of them, 29 killed and 34 wounded were from Zur's 54th Company. Egyptian sources reported 15 killed and 30 wounded, although {{this does not}} include the casualties <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intercepted reinforcements from Majdal. Even before the final retreating troops came home, the Givati command had issued a new operation order, calling for renewed artillery and air bombardment of Isdud, and small harassment operations. The 57th Battalion, which gained a bad reputation after its failures in Yibna and Isdud, carried out several such successful operations, regaining prestige in the brigade.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Esk, Express, Intrepid and Princess Victoria laid 236 mines off Bergen, North Holland, and on 15 May, {{she joined}} with Express and Ivanhoe to lay 164 mines off the Hook of Holland.

It was appointed that Moses and Israel should <b>suffer</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand of Pharaoh. And for this very purpose, said God, have I raised thee up, that is, to be a persecutor, and to reap the fruits thereof (Exo 9:16). It was also determined that Christ should <b>suffer</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand of Herod and Pontius Pilate; [...] "For of a truth," [...] said they, [...] "against thy holy child Jesus--both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, {{and the people of}} Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done" [...] (Acts 4:27).|$|R

5|$|The Black Hawk War {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 77 white settlers, militiamen, and regular soldiers. This figure does not include the deaths from cholera <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> relief force under General Winfield Scott. Estimates of how many members of the British Band died during the conflict range from about 450 to 600, or about half of the 1,100 people who entered Illinois with Black Hawk in 1832.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{were able}} to finish landing their troops, which {{may have contributed to}} the {{impression}} of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles. Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied beliefs about the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> two combatants {{are difficult}} to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often appeared a day or two later repaired. German personnel losses are clouded by the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E

5|$|The {{heaviest}} Allied {{losses were}} <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British infantry of XX Corps (which lost 116 killed in action), although {{the total number}} of the British force killed during the battle was 171. The 4th Light Horse Brigade suffered a total of 35 killed and 39 wounded; of these, the 12th Light Horse Regiment suffered 20 killed and 19 wounded. Most of the wounded light horsemen fell during the charge, with the high percentage of killed-to-wounded occurring during hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E

White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was {{selected}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1999 National Football League Draft. As a rookie in 1999, Bennett missed seven games due to a knee injury. After undergoing surgery on the knee, he missed all of the 2000 season. In 2001, New York expected Bennett to work in tandem with Tiki Barber but after suffering a hamstring injury, he was released on September 3, 2001. After multiple injuries to their running backs, the Giants became interested in re-signing Bennett but because of NFL rules {{they were unable to}} do so until January 2002. During this time period, he was offered contracts by the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins but rejected both hoping to return to the Giants. He re-signed with the Giants on January 16, 2002. During the season, Bennett was returned to the wide receiver position he played in high school, due to multiple injuries <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Giants players in that position. He was waived on December 4, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not run smoothly. The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
