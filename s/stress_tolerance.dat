Behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, and lowered <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{have been linked to}} paternal alcohol ingestion. The compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses to stress that children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use. These birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects (VSD) at birth. VSD has also been correlated with paternal alcohol abuse in humans.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{functions of}} trehalose 6 -phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose 6 ?phosphate phosphatase (TPP) from a tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, the corresponding cDNA clones were isolated. Those genes were designated NtTPS and NtTPP, respectively. NtTPS included a N-terminal extension according to comparison of deduced {{amino acid sequence}} of NtTPS with those of TPSs from Escherichia coli and yeast. The NtTPS was genetically modified to lack a region for the N-terminal extension and the modified gene was designated ΔNNtTPS. The genes were expressed in yeast tps 1 mutant as two separate proteins and as a NtTPS (or ΔNNtTPS) -NtTPP fusion protein. Western blot analysis showed that the NtTPS, NtTPP, and NtTPS-NtTPP were expressed abundantly in yeast, while the ΔNNtTPS and ΔNNtTPS-NtTPP were not detected. Interestingly, high levels of trehalose were accumulated in yeast expressing ΔNNtTPS and ΔNNtTPS-NtTPP {{in spite of their}} low-level expressions. Furthermore, <b>stress</b> <b>tolerances</b> of yeast against osmotic, freezing-thawing, and heat stresses were significantly improved by the expression of the tobacco gene, and the increased levels in tolerance were proportional to their trehalose levels.

In seagrape seedlings, the EcM fungus Scleroderma bermudense was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both sodium and chlorine, but an increase in potassium and phosphorus, implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance. Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus Boletus edulis.

The functions of the enzyme in oxidative and salt stresses have been reported previously. We have previously identified and characterized NTRC in Chlorella vulgaris. In the present study, we isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding 2 -Cys Prx from C. vulgaris and investigated the involvement of Chlorella NTRC/ 2 -Cys Prx system in several environmental <b>stress</b> <b>tolerances</b> by using yeast as a eukaryotic model.

In order to identify genes required for the stresses responses in the grass crop Zea mays, an ALDH (ZmALDH 22 A 1) gene was isolated and characterized. ZmALDH 22 A 1 belongs to the family ALDH 22 that is currently known only in plants. The ZmALDH 22 A 1 encodes a protein of 593 amino acids that shares high identity with the orthologs from Saccharum officinarum (95 %), Oryza sativa (89 %), Triticum aestivum (87 %) and Arabidopsis thaliana (77 %), respectively. Real-time PCR analysis indicates that ZmALDH 22 A 1 is expressed differentially in different tissues. Various elevated levels of ZmALDH 22 A 1 expression have been detected when the seedling roots exposed to abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). Tomato stable transformation of construct expressing the ZmALDH 22 A 1 signal peptide fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the CaMV 35 S-promoter reveals that the fusion protein is targeted to plastid.

First, {{the collection of the}} indigenous knowledge of stress tolerant rice accessions (locality and their special features known to farmers) in Bangladesh before they disappear. For instance, native farmers of Sylhet, Bangladesh call Kasalath (a well-known aus variety from which the PSTOL 1 gene has been identified) as Kasa Lota (young green shoot). Kasa Lota is well known among the greater Sylhet rice farmers for its tolerance in the nutrient poor soil. Second, evaluation (both field and laboratory screening) of more landraces from Bangladesh for abiotic <b>stress</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Third, de novo assembly and deep sequencing of one or more traditional land races, particularly aus as we often experienced the absence of agronomically important genes in the rice reference genome, Nipponbare. For instance, Nipponbare completely lacks SNORKEL, PSTOL 1 etc. alleles and possesses only intolerant alleles like SUB 1 A, DRO 1. Therefore, it would not be unlikely to anticipate the absence of master regulator(s) of other <b>stress</b> <b>tolerances</b> in Nipponbare. Fourth, identification of genomic signatures of abiotic stress adaptations by both conventional and modern GWAS studies. However, we need more sophisticated bioinformatics and computational algorithms along with a cloud computing platform as the existing tools and methods are unable to handle the extraordinarily growing scale of data. Fifth, development of abiotic stress tolerant or climate-smart rice varieties through intense breeding efforts capitalizing the MABC strategy even before the identification of the detailed molecular mechanisms of tolerance. For instance, the identification of the genetic basis of the semi-dwarf trait (defective gibberellin 20 -oxidase) (Spielmeyer et al. 2002) of the green revolutionary rice, IR 8 occurred almost 40  years after the revolution of IR 8 made, whereas Sub 1 A rice was literally developed (Neeraja et al. 2007) before the gene identification (Xu et al. 2006) as MABC required several years.|$|R
