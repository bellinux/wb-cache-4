500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Our Song" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. [...] While listening to [...] "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. [...] "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News. The video was conceptualized to be very fantasy-like and surreal. The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront her bedroom mirror, which she writes the word [...] "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in [...] a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs [...] "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying {{on a bed of}} flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes with Swift giggling while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> porch.|$|E

After intense problems he would relax by playing squash or by doing aerobatics in a P-1 Hawk maintained at the base. His son Robin recalled {{that they would}} share afternoons <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> porch of their quarters at Langley Field, Virginia, watching planes land. His home at Langley was a social gathering place for numerous aviation pioneers, war veterans, and air power advocates that included Eddie Rickenbacker, Fiorello La Guardia, Ernst Udet, Roscoe Turner, Elliott White Springs, Jimmie Mattern, and Beirne Lay. When the gatherings included his neighbor, Lt. Col. Carl Spaatz, his son fondly noted, they often ended with singing accompanied by Olds on the piano and Spaatz on the guitar.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Warner Bros. Studios lot, the [...] Batmobile {{combined}} {{inspiration from}} both the sleek, streamlined design of classic Batmobiles and the high-suspension, military build from the more recent Tumbler from The Dark Knight Trilogy. They were also inspired by the 1989 Batmobile. Designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos and Dennis McCarthy, the Batmobile is about 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. Unlike previous Batmobiles, it has a gatling gun <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and the back tires are shaved down tractor tires. The Batmobile elevates itself for scenes depicting it going into battle or when performing jumps, and lowers to the ground when cruising through the streets. The Batmobile appears in a flashback for Suicide Squad, when Batman was pursuing the Joker and Harley Quinn before their car crashed into the river, the Joker escaping while Harley was captured.|$|E
2500|$|The Senate is characterised by the {{predominance}} of the colour red, in both the carpet and the red leather of the seating and desks. [...] This reflects its role as the upper house and as a deliberative house like the House of Lords at Westminster. [...] The seating is in a horse-shoe pattern, around a central table. [...] Each senator had a seat and a desk, including those <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> benches (i.e., ministers). [...] At {{the end of the}} table is a desk for the clerks and behind them a large chair for the president. [...] Behind it are two thrones, to be used by the monarch and consort or, in their stead, the Governor-General and spouse, at official occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament.

60|$|Boyne {{remained}} {{in a silent}} rapture, {{and he did not}} notice they were no longer following the rest of their party in the other carriage.

Boyne was first aware that it was a humorous crowd when, at a turn of the street, their equipage was greeted with ironical cheers by a group of gay young Dutchmen on the sidewalk. Then he saw that the sidewalks were packed with people, who spread into the street almost to the tram, and that the house fronts were dotted with smiling Dutch faces, the faces of pretty Dutch girls, who seemed to share the amusement of the young fellows below.|$|E

60|$|The Sunday {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Ingua's mother in town proved a dull day with the Hoppers, who had been compelled to eat their chicken dinner themselves in default of customers. The dishes had been washed and Mary Ann, {{the daughter of the}} house, was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> porch in her Sunday gown and a rocking-chair, when an automobile drove up to the door and a dapper little man alighted. He was very elaborately dressed, with silk hat, patent-leather shoes and a cane setting off his Prince Albert coat and lavender striped trousers. Across his white waistcoat was a heavy gold watch-guard with an enormous locket dangling from it; he had a sparkling pin in his checkered neck-scarf that might be set with diamonds but perhaps wasn't; on his fingers gleamed two or three elaborate rings. He had curly blond hair and a blond moustache and he wore gold-rimmed eyeglasses. Altogether the little man was quite a dandy and radiated prosperity. So, when the driver of the automobile handed out two heavy suit cases and received from the stranger a crisp bill for his services, Mary Ann Hopper realized with exultation that the hotel was to have a guest.|$|E
60|$|It {{was over}} at last. The strain remained,--the great judge {{who had heard}} it {{declined}} to pronounce judgment immediately on {{the conclusion of the}} pleadings. It might be three days or it might be even a week before his decision was known. Deane turned away from the court with a strong and instinctive desire for solitude. The suspense long drawn out through the weeks and through the months, had become unbearable. He felt himself no longer able calmly to discuss the pros and the cons of the case with his fellow directors and friends. He was sick to heart of it all. He escaped from one or two passers-by, and a reporter or so who tried to buttonhole him, and ignoring his brougham, around which several others were waiting, he sprang into a hansom and drove to the garage where he kept his touring car. A few brief orders, a pencilled note to his servant, and Deane, leaving the garage by the other entrance, took the Tube to its terminus, walked out into the country, and was caught up within an hour by the car, in which his servant was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat {{by the side of the}} chauffeur.|$|E
