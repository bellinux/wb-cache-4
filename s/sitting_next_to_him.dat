5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} once again {{rejected}} by both sides. On the next day, 17 September, Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem by the militant Zionist group Lehi. A four-man team ambushed Bernadotte's motorcade in Jerusalem, killing him and a French UN observer <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus {{a serious threat to}} the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept the plan, which it considered disastrous. Unbeknownst to Lehi, the government had already decided to reject it and resume combat in a month. Bernadotte's deputy, American Ralph Bunche, replaced him.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessor, the {{syndicated}} What's My Line? did not emphasize formality as the panelists dressed in normal attire. In addition, the panelists were simply {{referred to by}} name and only their first names were displayed in front of them. The show did manage to keep some elements of the original series intact, as the intro used during the final two seasons on CBS was reused. The panelists also entered {{in the same manner}} as they had before with Soupy Sales (or the panelist occupying the seat furthest left when he was absent) coming out first and introducing the person <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and continuing down the line to Arlene Francis (or whoever occupied her seat while she was absent), who would then introduce the host.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Clark made a triumphal {{entry into}} Rome, with Juin <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> For Juin, the {{experience}} was bittersweet. He felt that the fruits of his victory had been lost through British caution, and the American obsession with the capture of Rome. His support for continuing the campaign in Italy now that the Allies were winning {{was rejected by the}} French command. On 4 July, the CEF captured Siena, where it celebrated Bastille Day, and then was withdrawn to participate in Operation Dragoon, codename for the Allied invasion of Southern France. In the wake of allegations of raping and pillaging by his North African troops in the Marocchinate, he took steps to curtail the abuses, with drastic measures, including the death penalty, that were not entirely successful owing to the animosity between the French and Italian people over the events of 1940.|$|E

5000|$|Namame {{was born}} from the Seimei stone (Star-Life Stone) near Iferui. He usually takes the {{appearance}} of a little stone doll, although when Takiko first found him, he was a stone giant, protecting the oracle Anlu, who was in his mouth. After being traumatized by human cruelty when he attempted to fit in, Namame found it very hard to trust others; it took Anru a whole day of <b>sitting</b> right <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> earn his trust. He was [...] "protecting" [...] Anru when Takiko and company found him. Namame was the fourth Celestial Warrior found by the Genbu priestess. His character, [...] "Bi", is typically found {{on the back of his}} head. Namame has the power to control the earth, which allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> manipulate the ground itself, create earthquakes, and shape stones into whatever he desires. In the end when Takiko makes her second wish for all living things to return to as they once were, Namame disappears back into the earth, promising to use his ability's to heal the country.

50|$|Outside the castle, the Crooked Man kills {{one of the}} wolves, then lures {{the others}} <b>to</b> chase <b>him</b> through his tunnels into the castle. In the throne room, David tells the King that {{he knows that he}} is Jonathan and about his {{betrayal}} of Anna. The Crooked Man appears, trying to tempt David to stay, promising protection from the wolves and Loups that burst in and massacre the guards. David refuses to betray Georgie to the Crooked Man, who dies after Leroi kills the King. At the Crooked Man's death, Anna sighs with joy and disappears. Because the Loups were a creation of Jonathan's fears, they crumble into dust after his death. The Woodsman appears at David's side, having survived the fight at the bridges. They leave the castle and begin to travel back to the woods; when they arrive, they find the tree open and waiting. After saying goodbye to the Woodsman and Scylla, David climbs into the portal. He wakes up swathed in bandages in a hospital bed; Rose is <b>sitting</b> asleep <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He wakes her, apologises for his behaviour to her, and falls into a deep sleep.|$|R

500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E

He used some words he knows he shouldn't have used." [...] Forte apparently didn't know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach Pat Riley because he thought Riley—who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was—was insulting him by asking if he'd ever been a [...] "Parrothead", the nickname for Buffett fans. Buffett didn't comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it with Matt Lauer on The Today Show three days later.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not.

After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "....a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me".

2500|$|We see Darwin {{portrayed as}} a monkey with his own human head. He holds a mirror up to another monkey which is <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It seems {{as if he would}} invite the monkey to ponder over himself and his existence. This is {{underlined}} by the two accompanying quotations of Shakespeare: [...] "This is the ape of form" [...] (from: Love's Labour's Lost, act 5, scene 2) and [...] "Some four or five descents since" [...] (All's Well that Ends Well, act 3, scene 7). Darwin's facial expression seems to encourage the monkey to recognise their common ancestry. The ape, in turn, looks into the mirror and tries to touch the reflection to literally grasp Darwin's suggestion and to assure himself of the authenticity of their kinship.|$|E
2500|$|George Sodini (September 30, 1960 – August 4, 2009), a 48-year-old {{systems analyst}} {{at the law firm}} of K Gates and a {{resident}} of Scott Township, was identified as the perpetrator.

His website states that he was [...] "never married" [...] and concludes [...] "Death Lives!" [...] Sodini states, [...] "Probably 99% of the people who know me well don't even think I was this crazy." [...] Sodini is reported to have left a note inside the gym bag stating his hatred for women. Nearly a week after the murders, it was revealed that Sodini had brought an inert grenade on a Port Authority bus on July 28, 2009.

2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates.

2500|$|In November 1991, Chrétien {{organised}} a party {{conference in}} Aylmer, Quebec where the Liberals formally disallowed {{most of the}} economic nationalism and protectionism of the Pearson-Trudeau years, and instead embraced globalization as the cure for the recession of the early 1990s. Reflecting the changed emphasis, at the Aylmer conference, the Liberals declared {{their support for the}} 1987 free trade agreement with the United States, which the party had famously promised to tear up if they won the 1988 election, and instead Mulroney was now denounced for not going far enough in opening up the economy by signing more free trade agreements with other nations. Reflecting the changed emphasis, Chrétien in a pointed symbolic move, had the outspoken pro-free trade Liberal Roy MacLaren <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on his right while the equally outspoken anti-free trade Liberal Lloyd Axworthy sat at some distance from Chrétien on his left. Delivering the keynote speech at the Aylmer conference, Chrétien came out firmly in support of globalization, stating that: [...] "Protectionism is not right wing or left wing. It is simply passé. Globalization is not right wing or left wing. It is simply a fact of life". Chrétien's biographer Lawrence Martin wrote that the Aylmer conference marked Chrétien's first real achievement as Liberal leader, as {{it was the first time}} that he put forward a positive vision for Canada, instead of automatically opposing everything that Mulroney was doing without offering a constructive alternative. In an interview with Martin, Chrétien called himself a centrist by inclination, and stated that Aylmer conference was the beginning of his efforts to bring the Grits to the political center.|$|E
2500|$|This type of [...] "insensitivity" [...] is likened by Ştefănescu {{with that}} of [...] "a cadaver on a {{dissection}} table", or [...] "a statue that we can examine from all sides". The critic finds the work more daring than any possible analogy in local letters. He compares it to Miron Radu Paraschivescu's Jurnalul unui cobai ("The Diary of a Guinea Pig"), which is however [...] "unforgiving" [...] only with its author's acquaintances; to Livius Ciocârlie's diaries, which nevertheless [...] "remain with the limits of literary decency"; to Mircea Cărtărescu's Travesti novel, which discusses transsexualism in metaphors that make it [...] "less shocking." [...] The same overall comparison was made by critic Ioana Pârvulescu, who found Straja dragonilor to evade the tradition of Romanian autobiographical literature, {{in that it was}} freed from [...] "the obsession of the image", without courting the reader's sympathy. She adds: [...] "Approaching death is a guarantee for a sincerity of the best quality. The only danger that stalks among the pages is that of time running out, and this provides [...] chaotic impatience and hastening, like the agglomeration of the last sand grains inside the neck of an hourglass." [...] The episodes in Negoiţescu's book portray the boy as a seeker of promiscuous sexual experiences, who enjoys the advances of grownup males (such as his father's orderly), but also experiments with girls his own age. In one narrative sequence, the author recounts how, finding himself inside a dark cinema, he satisfied his urges by fondling the genitalia of an unknown man <b>sitting</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> thus taking a gamble with public condemnation of a homosexual acts. Such experiences, Stan proposes, reveal the protagonist-narrator to have been [...] "hedonistic", [...] "Dionysian" [...] and [...] "histrionic", characterized by an unwillingness in taking critical distance from [...] "the object of his contemplation", and displaying [...] "a psychology of the excess".|$|E
