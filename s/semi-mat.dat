Three basic glazes were chosen: one transparent, one mat, and one <b>semi-mat.</b> To these basic glazes more than fifty inorganic materials were added in separate test batches. A diversity of results was produced ranging from a glossy, sand-speckled glaze to a rough glaze made with aluminum shavings; from a white, iridescent glaze made with gypsum to a dull gun-metal black glaze made with brass shavings; from a transparent colorless glaze made with aspirin tablets to a dark green translucent glaze made with copper filings. This study can be used as the basis for a unit on glazes in a secondary school classroom; its purpose is to serve as an introduction to glazes, while teaching the students an appreciation of some of the earthâ€™s abundant raw materials and how they can be used in ceramic glazes...|$|E
