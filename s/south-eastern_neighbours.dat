2500|$|Waterford {{were back}} in the {{championship}} decider again in 1959 and, {{for the second time in}} three years, Kilkenny were the opponents. [...] The game saw ‘the Cats’ leak five easy goals, allowing their <b>south-eastern</b> <b>neighbours</b> to clinch a 1-17 to 5-5 draw. [...] The replay took place a few weeks later, with Eddie Keher lining out in his first championship decider. [...] That game was an exciting affair also, with Waterford securing a 3-12 to 1-10 victory. [...] It was their second-ever All-Ireland title.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall, {{countries}} that previously formed part of the Eastern Bloc have worked on their 'return to Europe' through their accession to traditionally West European supranational institutions such as the European Union and NATO. The book investigates the political and historical foreign policy identities of six of these countries and shows how, despite a clear policy oriented towards the West, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovenia have participated in a differentiated manner in the definition of a European policy towards the Eastern and <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>neighbours.</b> Through analysis of evidence from an original and broad data set, this study highlights that the coherence of EU policy towards the East is mainly linked to its members' capacity to reconcile their political and historical foreign policy identities. The book will be of particular interest to policy-makers, students and specialists of the EU and East Central Europe, {{as well as to the}} larger public interested in European integration.

50|$|In the south-west, Lakshmikarna fought an {{inconclusive}} {{war with}} the Kalyani Chalukya king Someshvara I. He also seems to have fought with his <b>south-eastern</b> <b>neighbour,</b> the Chola king Rajadhiraja. In the east, he defeated a Gurjara king, who can be identified with the Chaulukya king Bhima I.|$|R
500|$|The RUF {{was coming}} under {{increasing}} pressure from political angles {{as well as}} from the British-trained SLA. It was heavily dependent on Sierra Leone's <b>south-eastern</b> <b>neighbour</b> Liberia, led by Charles Taylor, and derived the majority of its income from the sale of diamonds smuggled through Liberia, which became known as blood diamonds. In late 2000, the Sierra Leone government—supported by the British, UNAMSIL, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)—entered into talks with the RUF. On 10 November, the two parties signed a 30-day ceasefire that provided for UNAMSIL to deploy throughout the entire country (it had previously been prevented from operating in many RUF-controlled areas), for the RUF to return seized weapons and equipment to UNAMSIL, and for the RUF to enter the DDR [...] process. The ceasefire was later extended by a further 90 days. The UN Security Council embargoed Liberian diamonds in Resolution 1343 in March 2001. Shortly afterwards, the RUF began large-scale disarmament and agreed to a simultaneous disarmament with the Civil Defence Force, a militia group loyal to the government. By September, over 16,000 militia members (including around 6,500 RUF) had been through the DDR process and the combatants in the diamond-producing areas had all disarmed.|$|R
40|$|The EU’s Eastern Partnership {{is a new}} {{regional}} initiative for its eastern European neighbours and this review looks at it {{in relation to the}} existing Enlargement and European Neighbourhood policies and in light of their future development. In 2008 the EU’s relations with its neighbours were marked by a particular interest. After the re-launch of its relations to the south with the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean, a new initiative for the east immediately followed: the Eastern Partnership. The Partnership aims to intensify the EU’s relations with three of its eastern and three of its <b>south-eastern</b> European <b>neighbours.</b> This ARI examines the most recent developments in the neighbourhood, with a special focus on the latest Commission’s Communication on the Eastern Partnership, and also provides a short overview of the initial Polish-Swedish proposal. It then evaluates the impact of the initiative on already existing EU-policies –Enlargement and European Neighbourhood– and discusses the possible future development of relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours participating in the Eastern Partnership...|$|R
