50|$|In 1823, Shaw {{stepped down}} as librarian, and the King's Chapel Library and the Theological Library {{belonging}} to the Boston Association of Ministers were deposited in the Athenæum. Work was begun on a <b>shelf</b> <b>catalog</b> in 1827. That same year, the art gallery was established, and the first annual exhibition opened. Measures were undertaken in 1830 to turn the collections into a circulating library. Once the Athenæum became a circulating library, only four books were allowed to be checked out at a time.|$|E
5000|$|Schnapp's The Library Beyond the Book of 2013 (published in 2014), {{written with}} Matthew Battles, surveys {{elements}} of libraries potentially relevant to today's transitional digital era. It examines past mainstays such as buildings, <b>shelves,</b> <b>catalogs,</b> access cards, reference desks, carrel desks, and librarians, and wonders how each might find new {{purpose in the}} near future. It discusses the importance of databases, digital preservation, mobile libraries, serendipity, cloistering, and meatspaces, and mentions initiatives such as Rio de Janeiro's Manguinhos Library Park, the pop-up Occupy Wall Street Library, Chattanooga Public Library's makerspace, the Digital Public Library of America, and London's Idea Store. In {{the words of one}} reviewer, the authors [...] "imagine six plausible scenarios for serving tomorrow’s diverse information consumers, situating libraries as everything from study shelters to civic institutions functioning as mobile libraries, reading rooms promoting social change, and/or event-driven knowledge centers." [...] It is {{the first in a series}} of Metalab publications [...] "that will investigate the role of print-based scholarship in the digital age." ...|$|R
50|$|Artstor is a {{non-profit}} organization that builds and distributes the Digital Library, an online resource of more than 2 million images in the arts, architecture, humanities, and sciences, and Shared <b>Shelf,</b> a Web-based <b>cataloging</b> and image management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections.|$|R
40|$|A {{functioning}} technical {{processing system}} in a two-year community college library utilizes a model 2201 Friden Flexowriter with punch card control and tab card reading units, an IBM 026 Key Punch, and an IBM 1440 computer, with two tape and two disc drives, to produce all acquisitions and catalog files based primarily on a single typing {{at the time of}} initiating an order. Records generated by the initial order, with slight updating of information, are used to produce, via computer, manual and mechanized order files and <b>shelf</b> lists, <b>catalogs</b> in both the traditional 3 x 5 card form and book form, mechanized claiming of unfilled orders, and subject bibliographies...|$|R
50|$|Artstor also {{provides}} Shared <b>Shelf,</b> a Web-based <b>cataloging</b> and digital media management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections. Shared Shelf {{was launched in}} 2011. Artstor worked with ten institutional partners to develop this service: Bard College, Colby College, Cornell University, Harvard University, Middlebury College, New York University, Society of Architectural Historians, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Miami, and Yale University.|$|R

Situated {{near the front}} entrance, {{the reference}} desk, a semi-circular wooden desk, greets visitors.

At right stands a statue of a woman wearing a toga carrying a bag of fruits...|$|R
50|$|While he {{continued}} to teach classes at the École Supérieure, Warren volunteered to run the school's small dance library, thus beginning his fourth career. Despite a limited budget, he installed proper book <b>shelves,</b> updated the <b>cataloging</b> system, allowed books to circulate, and began a vigorous campaign of acquisitions to enlarge the library's holdings. Eventually, he donated his own sizeable collection of dance materials, sought donations from friends in the dance world, and continued to purchase books, videos, prints, photographs, programs, and dance memorabilia. He was officially appointed curator of the library in 1982 and served in that capacity for twenty-four years, until 2006. Now named the Bibliothèque de la Danse Vincent-Warren, in his honor, {{it is the largest}} dance library in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|The task of {{cataloging}} {{was important}} and difficult {{in these years}} because at that time there was no accepted system for doing so. Melville Dewey’s decimal classification system was not published until 1876 and not adopted at the University of Michigan Library until 1897. In the meantime the Library used a so-called “fixed” location system, introduced by Ten Brook, organizing <b>shelves</b> and the <b>catalog</b> according to the principle that each book should have a specific fixed place. According to Abbott this meant that books were arranged by topic and {{more or less in}} chronological order within topic. Each time a new book was received, though, the entire section’s locations and catalog information had to be redone. So it was little surprise that the job of cataloger became important. [...] With the encouragement of Davis the Regents appointed Farrand full-time Assistant Librarian, a position normally held by a man and previously held by Davis himself, at an annual salary of $400 in January 1878. By June 1878 she was included on the list of [...] "revised" [...] salaries set by the Board at $500 per year. In November 1883 her salary was raised to $600 per year.|$|R
