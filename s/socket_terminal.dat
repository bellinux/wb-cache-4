With changes {{in size and}} shape, basic tool concept applicable to mounting and dismounting of transformers, <b>sockets,</b> <b>terminal</b> strips and mechanical parts. Inexpensive tool fabricated as needed by bending two pieces of steel wire. Exact size and shape selected to suit part manipulated and nature of inaccessible mounting space...|$|R
50|$|The BS 6312 {{specification}} {{defines the}} terminal numbering of a socket-outlet {{in the opposite}} direction to the pin numbers of the <b>socket.</b> Thus <b>terminal</b> 1 is connected to pin 6, terminal 2 to pin 5 and so on. The pins of the 631A plug are numbered in ascending order from left to right with the contacts facing upwards and the latch on the right hand side.|$|R
50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have plug and <b>socket</b> connectors or <b>terminal</b> blocks, but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common. Small components have bare lead wires for soldering. They are manufactured using casting.|$|R
50|$|The power shelf can be {{combined}} with a distribution and control unit. The distribution unit contains a controller, I/O units and DIN rails for holding AC and DC distribution MCBs, battery connections and battery MCBs, as well as screw <b>terminal</b> <b>sockets</b> for AC input and DC bus connections.|$|R

25|$|R-Code is a {{high-level}} scripting language for AIBO. R-Code {{allows you to}} very easily create simple programs for AIBO to execute. While it does not allow the low-level control that the OPEN-R SDK has, what it lacks in power it makes up for in simplicity. Remoting is possible via a simple <b>terminal</b> <b>socket</b> connection via WiFi. Commercial usage is allowed, and the license fee is free.|$|R
2500|$|R-CodePlus is a {{derivative}} of R-Code by AiboPet with several added functionalities. R-CodePlus is a superset of R-Code {{in terms of}} language, so everything written in standard R-Code will work on a R-CodePlus memorystick (for the same Model AIBO). R-CodePlus exposes some new [...] "basic" [...] AIBO functions such as simple face recognition, name registration, and camera adjustment settings. In addition to the standard R-Code <b>terminal</b> <b>socket</b> for remoting, R-CodePlus supplies a [...] "Telemety" [...] socket for several binary data transfers such as AIBO's camera image and sending/receiving sound. R-CODE has been extended to R-CODE plus by Aibopet ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceThe precise {{management}} of orchards cannot {{do without the}} support of various orchard field data, and the orchard field data server is an effective solution thereto. The orchard field data server consists of data acquisition unit, data communication unit, data analysis unit and such diversified server <b>sockets</b> of user <b>terminal</b> as supportive personal computer (PC), notebook computer, mobile phone and telephone. The orchard workers can set data acquisition cycle according to the requirements, and the processed data can serve the orchard workers in many respects. After its promotion and application in many orchards in such regions as Liaoning and Beijing, the said system has been proved to be of easy use and reliable effect, so that the project has achieved good social, ecological and economic benefits...|$|R
50|$|In the Unix {{operating}} system, most {{types of}} {{input and output}} operations {{are considered to be}} streams of bytes read from a device or written to a device. This stream of bytes model is used for file I/O, <b>socket</b> I/O, and <b>terminal</b> I/O in order to provide device independence. In order to read and write to a device at the application level, the program calls a function to open the device which may be a real device such as a terminal or a virtual device such as a network port or a file in a file system. The device's physical characteristics are mediated by the operating system which in turn presents an abstract interface that allows the programmer to read and write bytes from/to the device. The operating system then performs the actual transformation needed to read and write the stream of bytes to the device.|$|R
