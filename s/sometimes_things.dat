500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 March 2014, Gordon Skene {{departed}} {{the band}} owing to [...] "differing opinions" [...] {{with the four}} other members. The band wrote on Facebook: [...] "There is no more to tell other than <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> just don’t work out and when people have differing opinions often the best option is to simply part ways {{and get on with}} life separately." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes with {{creative}} things [...] all comes together [...] and <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> almost {{come together and}} it's better to just leave it. So we love that song. We had a ball shooting the video. It {{just so happens that}} the whole thing, for some reason or another, didn't quite come together so we just decided to leave it. And that's what happened.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{experiments}} performed on the show, many have not gone as expected. Sometimes, these mishaps have rendered the test equipment unusable, such as when the rocket in the [...] "Rocket Car Revisit" [...] exploded on ignition. Others have even resulted in minor injuries to the personnel involved with the show, such as when Tory banged his knee falling off a fire tower; the fall was expected and prepared for using a safety harness, but him injuring his knee was not foreseen. The most common injuries come from moving safety equipment which has led to stitches and at least four broken fingers. [...] These kinds of incidents are usually included in the broadcast program, with little other media attention, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> fail in more spectacular and news-worthy ways.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the vault}} final, Maroney won {{a silver medal}} with a score of 15.083. She {{performed}} an Amanar for her first vault but fell on her second. This fall ended her 33-vault hitting streak in competition. Even with the fall, Maroney still came in second. She said, [...] "I didn't get my full block, my hands didn't really touch the vault. I still walked out with a silver medal and I'm happy about that. I'll have to watch the video {{and figure out what}} happened. It's really sad that I had to fall on that vault but I'm glad I won a silver medal. I know I can do better vaults but I also know I didn't deserve the gold medal because I fell on my second vault. It happens. It's gymnastics. You can't always be perfect. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>things</b> don't go as planned." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, she {{was criticized}} after saying that {{breastfeeding}} should be law. She told Harper's Bazaar UK, [...] "Some people here [...] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are {{you going to}} give chemical food to your child when they are so little?'...I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months." [...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child. It's unfortunate that in an interview <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> can seem so black and white." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1990 to 1994, Aniston had a {{relationship}} with actor Daniel McDonald. Aniston met Brad Pitt in 1998; their relationship became high-profile as it was widely publicized in the press. She married Pitt, after two years of dating, on July 29, 2000 in a lavish Malibu wedding. For a few years, their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success. On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation and finalized their divorce on October 2, 2005. During their divorce proceedings, there was intense speculation in the media that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, whom he started dating soon after the split. In the following months, the public's reaction toward the divorce was reported in the press, and [...] "Team Aniston" [...] and [...] "Team Jolie" [...] T-shirts appeared throughout the country. The divorce made the front-pages of tabloid magazines for years, and it still continues to be discussed in the media. Aniston commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating that [...] "Nobody did anything wrong.... It was just like, <b>sometimes</b> <b>things</b> [...]" ...|$|E
