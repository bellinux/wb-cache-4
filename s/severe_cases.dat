5|$|Dengue can {{occasionally}} affect {{several other}} body systems, either in isolation or {{along with the}} classic dengue symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly {{as a result of}} impairment of vital organs, for example, the liver.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. <b>Severe</b> <b>cases</b> involving coma, convulsions, or death are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cases of}} croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating. In <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. <b>Severe</b> <b>cases</b> may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|In {{especially}} <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or {{the full}} {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E

Seven chemical {{workers who were}} accidentally exposed to chlorine gas in separate accidents were investigated. The usual symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, and chest pains, the symptoms starting within 10 minutes of exposure and lasting two to eight days. Chest radiographs showed congestion, consolidation, and nodules; lung oedema was also present in a <b>severe</b> <b>case.</b> These changes usually cleared within one week but in the <b>severe</b> <b>case</b> persisted for 10 weeks. Three patients had respiratory failure. Hypoxaemia was found in four patients and was quickly corrected by oxygen therapy in three of them, but in the <b>severe</b> <b>case</b> hypoxaemia persisted for four days despite continuous oxygen therapy.

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more <b>severe</b> <b>cases</b> (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. <b>Severe</b> <b>cases</b> may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E

5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. <b>Severe</b> <b>cases</b> can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In <b>severe</b> <b>cases,</b> symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
