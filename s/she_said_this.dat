5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley {{said that they were}} standard tools used in counter-terrorism tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked for the return of the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. She said in a cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US may be trying to oust her from power, or even assassinate her. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E
25|$|Following Meg Whitman's {{appointment}} as CEO of HP, {{in conjunction with}} an announcement of the company's plans to continue developing webOS as an open-source operating system, {{she said that the}} company would continue using the OS in devices, specifically resuming its use in tablets. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> would not happen in 2012, but would probably take place in 2013. In February 2013, HP sold the source code and transferred the remaining webOS team to LG, so it is unlikely there will be a HP-produced webOS tablet.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 in an {{interview}} on 60 Minutes and in a documentary film on Channel 4, Yates claimed that Hutchence's death may have resulted from autoerotic asphyxiation which contradicted her previous statements to police investigators and the coroner. In producing his coroner's report, Hand had specifically considered the suggestions of accidental death (coupled with the fact that Hutchence left no suicide note) but had discounted it based on substantial evidence presented to the contrary. Despite the official coroner's report, fans and relatives considered his death accidental. In 2000, Patricia Glassop (Hutchence's mother, who had remarried) and Tina Schorr (his sister), gave {{an interview}} on This Morning, asserting that Yates had {{on more than one occasion}} made threats of harming herself or the baby if Hutchence did not marry her, and that they believed <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> again on the morning of his death, directly precipitating his suicide.|$|E

500|$|With {{a decade-long}} career, MTV {{described}} Ali {{as one of}} the [...] "enduring empresses" [...] of electronic dance music and Queen of Clubs Trilogy as [...] "aptly titled". Noted for being the [...] "definitive" [...] and [...] "unmistakable" [...] voice of dance music, she is said to have [...] "enriched" [...] and [...] "invigorated" [...] the genre. Ali has gone on to become an oft-requested collaborator by DJs and producers. She was praised for acquiring notability in a male and DJ-dominated genre where vocalists serve as supporting acts. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was a double-edged sword as she was also treated as competition by DJs. [...] In December 2010, she received her first Grammy nomination when the Morgan Page remix of [...] "Fantasy" [...] was nominated in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category.|$|E
500|$|The protagonists are {{examined}} {{not only as}} individuals, but also by how they connect to people in their lives, {{such as in the}} conflicting love and failed relationships between man and woman; mother and daughter. [...] For example, critic Elizabeth Brown-Guillory notes of the story [...] "Never Marry a Mexican": [...] "Cisneros portrays the mother as a destructive emotional force, alienating and condemning her daughter to repeating her own mother’s destructive powers." [...] This unsuccessful relationship between daughter and mother also affects {{the ways in which the}} women relate to men, as the mother is left at fault for any problematic situations with the daughter's male companions. For example, the daughter Clemencia remembers: [...] "Never marry a Mexican, my ma said once and always. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> because of my father. ... I’ll [...] never marry. Not any man." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 2, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Miceli would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, under her Alundra Blayze moniker. On Twitter, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was a sign of respect, since that was her name in WWE, but [...] "that bitch Madusa will be on stage speaking." [...] During her speech, in response to constant questions about her dumping the WWF Women's Championship belt in the trash on Monday Nitro, her inductor, Natalya, wheeled a trash can onstage. Miceli (calling herself both Madusa and Alundra Blayze) withdrew the belt, which she stressed was a good-looking [...] "women's wrestling belt", and said it was finally [...] "back home where it belongs" [...] after 20 years. She held the belt on her shoulder, and referred to herself as the reigning WWF Women's Champion.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} 25 tracks, 12 {{of which}} last five seconds of silence, making the first 1 {{minute of the}} album all silent as respect for a fan named Justin, which had the 10th track, or 22nd, named after him. The concept of the song [...] "Justin" [...] was about the boy with the same name dying of intestinal cancer. His last wish was to meet the members of Korn. [...] Winston-Salem Journal writer [...] Ed Bumgardner [...] described Korn's work as having [...] "shaped rap, metal, and punk into a sonic maelstrom that is brutal, aggressive - and reasonably musical". [...] The Daily News said that [...] "the band shovels chunky beats into an already complex sound..." [...] Michael Mehle of Rocky Mountain News said, [...] "For the uninitiated, the classic Korn sound comes rumbling out of the speakers on the first cut: It's On! grinds fuzzy guitars, thunderous beats, and shouts of gut-wrenching rage into an anthem for the alienated", and gave other positive remarks. The Charlotte Observer said the album was dark, but humble. A Zeeland high school assistant principal {{said in an interview}} for a Michigan newspaper that the music is [...] "indecent, vulgar, obscene,and intends to be insulting". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> after giving a student a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with Korn on it.|$|E
2500|$|Part {{of the set}} for Seabiscuit was set in Tijuana {{during the}} Prohibition era, Oppewall and her staff {{consulting}} vintage postcards {{in order to create}} the set; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> part of the film was especially difficult to research because, [...] "A Tijuana Historical Society didn't exactly exist back then." [...] She also built a replica of the ranch owned by Charles S. Howard, the owner of the racehorse Seabiscuit, out of fir planks. Actor Jeff Bridges, who played Howard, was so impressed with the set that he made an unsuccessful attempt to buy it and have it shipped to his property in Montana, despite Oppewall's assurances that it was just a set and was not built to last. In a similar episode, the owners of the Santa Anita racetrack were so impressed with her design for a tote board that they wanted to keep it.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Stein's {{widely known}} [...] "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" [...] quotation, [...] "there is no there there" [...] {{is also one}} of her most famous. It appears in Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the {{farmland}} had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue).

2500|$|Though Silent Spring had {{generated}} a fairly {{high level of}} interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became more intense with its serialization, {{which began in the}} June 16, 1962, issue. [...] This brought the book {{to the attention of the}} chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as the American public. Around that time, Carson learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book-of-the-Month for October; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> would [...] "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks likemuch less The New Yorker." [...] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version were published in Audubon Magazine. There was another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide had broken just before the book's publication, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|One way or another, Nell's father {{seems to}} have been out of the picture by the time of her {{childhood}} in Covent Garden, and her [...] "dipsomaniac mother, [...] sister", Rose, were left in a low situation. She experimented with cross-dressing between 1663-1667 going under the name [...] "William Nell" [...] and adopting a false beard; her observations informed a most successful and hilarious character interpretation acting as a man on the stage in March 1667. Old Madam Gwyn was by most accounts an alcoholic whose business was running a bawdy house (or brothel). There, or in the bawdy house of one Madam Ross, Nell would spend at least some time. It is possible she worked herself as a child prostitute; Peter Thomson, in the Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre, says it is [...] "probable". A rare mention of her upbringing from the source herself might be seen to contradict the idea: A 1667 entry in Samuel Pepys' diary records, second-hand, thatHere Mrs. Pierce tells me [...] that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst's whore. Nell answered then, [...] "I was but one man's whore, though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter's praying daughter!". However, it is not out of the question that Gwyn was merely echoing the satirists of the day, if <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> at all.|$|E
2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to sit down in a chair and talk about something that doesn't mean anything to me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E
