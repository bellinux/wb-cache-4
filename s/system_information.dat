5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and <b>system</b> <b>information</b> are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E

This paper examines {{the nature and extent}} of the relationships between strategic <b>information</b> <b>system</b> and business strategy pursued by the firms. A structured questionnaire was developed and self-administered to managers in the capital city, Kuala Lumpur. A total of 86 usable responses were used to analyse the results of the study. The findings show that there were five types of strategic <b>information</b> <b>system</b> used by Malaysian firms: accounting <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> finance <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> marketing <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> management <b>information</b> <b>system</b> and general <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The business strategies pursued were focus strategy, cost leadership strategy and differentiation strategy. Empirical evidence detected a {{relationship between}} the strategic <b>information</b> <b>system</b> used and the business strategy adopted. There were also significant differences between each of the business strategies pursued and type of strategic <b>information</b> <b>system</b> used by the firms.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalise {{the notion of}} (algebraic) <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to {{continuous}} <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Just as algebraic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of Scott domains, continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of continuous Scott domains. The class of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> can be generated from the subclass of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in the sense that}} the category of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Because qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to the qualitative domains of Girard (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 45, 159 - 192 (1986)) this implies that the category of continuous Scott domains is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative domains. We show how constructions on qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (such as product and function space) can be "translated" to constructions on continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Among other things, we prove that the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is weak Cartesian closed. Finally, we define two universal <b>information</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|CM {{emphasizes}} the functional relation between parts, subsystems, and systems for effectively controlling system change. It helps {{to verify that}} proposed changes are systematically considered to minimize adverse effects. Changes to the system are proposed, evaluated, and implemented using a standardized, systematic approach that ensures consistency, and proposed changes are evaluated {{in terms of their}} anticipated impact on the entire system. CM verifies that changes are carried out as prescribed and that documentation of items and systems reflects their true configuration. A complete CM program includes provisions for the storing, tracking, and updating of all <b>system</b> <b>information</b> on a component, subsystem, and system basis.|$|E
25|$|The BIOS {{directly}} controlled hardware components {{other than}} the CPU and main memory. It contained functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implemented the CP/M file system and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) {{on top of the}} BIOS. The CCP took user commands and either executed them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loaded and started an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and <b>system</b> <b>information).</b> Third-party applications for CP/M were also essentially transient commands.|$|E
25|$|CM applied {{over the}} life cycle of a system {{provides}} visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of <b>system</b> <b>information</b> and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned many fold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and sometimes can have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.|$|E

25|$|By {{creating}} this <b>system,</b> <b>information</b> flow was primarily in one direction, {{and continued to}} be split out on the way down. For instance, the filter room might be receiving 15 reports per minute from various CH sites, but these would be about formations that might cover the entire coast of Great Britain. Portions of these reports, say those over Kent, {{would be sent to}} 11 Group, while others, the attack on RAF Driffield for instance, would only be relayed to 13 Group. In turn, 11 Group's operations room would relay only those tracks of interest down to the sectors, filtering out tracks that were out of their range, or being handled by other sectors. Finally, the sector operators only had to relay information to the pilots that actually had an effect on their flight– data about other formations was not relayed, freeing the radio time.|$|E

Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions.
