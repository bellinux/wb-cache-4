5|$|However, {{the claims}} for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt, {{following}} the first detailed <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown.

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
40|$|Mitotic and meiotic {{chromosomal}} karyotypes {{have been}} described for Gegeneophis ramaswamii and G. usp (unspecified species). Based on the available karyological information from among <b>the</b> eight species <b>of</b> Gegeneophis, a tentative scheme is proposed for their karyotypic phylogeny. A closer <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two in an otherwise homologous chromosomal pair (chromosome number 13) in the complement is suggestive of a XX-XY sex-chromosome differentiation...|$|R

5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. <b>Scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, {{the project}} was called into {{question}} when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script {{in an attempt to}} reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, , White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative, as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

30|$|Maybe {{the most}} {{important}} step would be to reach an organisational ethos of honest error-friendliness together with a common spirit to bring the organisation forward. This requires a consequent self-scrutiny on all levels of an organisation for which Argyris (1977, 1994) suggests <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> double-loop-learning which includes questioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system itself and <b>the</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> processes, <b>the</b> reasons and motives behind them (Argyris 1994) {{as well as the}} staff members’ attitude and behaviour in order to truly improve, change or abolish long-established routines which hinder any cultural and inner organisational changes.|$|R
