5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called <b>sheers.</b> One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple <b>sheers</b> operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
25|$|The outlay {{of money}} on {{equipment}} varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper <b>sheers.</b> Mechanized planters, {{at a cost of}} about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers. Farmers can purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3per tree.|$|E

50|$|Though <b>sheer</b> {{stockings}} {{have been}} popular since the 1920s, {{and have been}} used in women's nightwear for some time, the use of <b>sheer</b> fabrics in other clothing has become more common in recent years. There was a predominant <b>sheer</b> fashion trend in fashion circles since 2008, with <b>sheer</b> fabrics being used in tight clothes, layers, and in delicate feminine draping.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sheer</b> is {{a measure}} of {{longitudinal}} main deck curvature, in naval architecture. The <b>sheer</b> forward is usually twice that of <b>sheer</b> aft. Increases in the rise of the <b>sheer</b> forward and aft builds volume into the hull, and in turn increases its buoyancy forward and aft, thereby keeping the ends from diving into an oncoming wave and slowing the ship. In the early days of sail, one discussed a hull's <b>sheer</b> in terms of how much [...] "Hang" [...] it had. William Sutherland's The Ship-builders Assistant (1711) covers this information in more detail.|$|R
25|$|The {{postgraduate}} {{master of}} arts in creative writing, founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970, {{is regarded as the}} most respected in the United Kingdom, and admission to the programme is competitive. The course has gone on to produce a number of distinguished authors, including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Anne Enright, Tash Aw, Andrew Miller, Owen <b>Sheers,</b> Tracy Chevalier, Trezza Azzopardi, Panos Karnezis and Suzannah Dunn. The German émigré novelist W. G. Sebald also taught in the School of Literature and Creative Writing, and founded the British Centre for Literary Translation, until his death in a car accident in 2001. Experimental novelist Alan Burns was the university's first writer-in-residence.|$|E
25|$|A stuff gag is {{very similar}} to, and works {{in the same way}} as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day <b>sheers,</b> bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, {{allowing}} the top to pull it out easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag.|$|E
500|$|Ayola's first {{prolific}} television {{role was}} in the ITV drama Soldier Soldier, in which she starred throughout its third series in 1993 as soldier's wife Bernie Roberts. Ayola credits her chemistry with co-star Akim Mogaji, who played her on-screen husband Luke Roberts, for winning her her audition. She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett, and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay. She has spoken critically {{of the way the}} BBC treated the soap, moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series. She acted alongside Pauline Quirke in both Maisie Raine and Being April, deeming Quirke to be a [...] "fantastic" [...] actress, and one she would work alongside again [...] "like a shot". In 1996, Ayola appeared at the National Theatre in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 2001, she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow, alongside poet Owen <b>Sheers</b> and performance artist Mark Rees. She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show's launch, and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series. She has since concluded that [...] "the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren't really into watching TV", but at the time was outspoken against the show's cancellation, stating: ...|$|E

This crane was worked by four men driving through {{a gear train}} of 632 times, which must have been hard and slow work at full capacity. As {{the capacity of the}} crane was so obviously limited by its motive power, not its strength, they were an obvious candidate for steam power – as was later re-applied to the 60 ton [...] crane at Keysham. There was even a proposal for a [...] high crane, to replace masting <b>sheers</b> at Woolwich.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>sheer</b> hulks {{originated}} with the Royal Navy in the 1690s, and persisted in Britain {{until the early}} nineteenth century. Most <b>sheer</b> hulks were decommissioned warships; Chatham, built in 1694, {{was the first of}} only three purpose-built vessels. There were at least six <b>sheer</b> hulks in service in Britain at any time throughout the 1700s.
