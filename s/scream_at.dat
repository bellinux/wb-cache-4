5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> each other because she had had sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to <b>scream.</b> <b>At</b> Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

For two hours the attackers tortured the young man. One shoved cigarette butts into his mouth, another took issue with Roumi's Jewish origin (paternal), grabbed correction fluid and scrawled sale juif ("dirty Jew") and sale PD ("dirty faggot") on his forehead. When the issue of his sexual orientation arose, one of them placed a condom on the tip of a stick and shoved it in Roumi's mouth. The six men proceeded to <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> him and threaten that he would die the way Halimi did. The men were all arrested.|$|E

25|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of punk {{rock in the}} mid-1990s and the 2000s, some hardcore bands signed with major record labels. The first was New York's H2O, who released its album Go (2001) for MCA. Despite an extensive tour and an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, the album was not commercially successful, and when the label folded, the band and the label parted ways. In 2002, California's AFI signed to DreamWorks Records and changed its sound considerably for its successful major label debut Sing the Sorrow. Chicago's Rise Against were signed by Geffen Records, and three of its releases on the label were certified platinum by the RIAA. Rise Against gradually diminished hardcore elements from their music, culminating with 2008's Appeal to Reason, which lacked the intensity found in their earlier albums. Notable independent label Bridge 9 Records have seen several of their artists rise to prominence, including Defeater, Verse and Have Heart, who had a Billboard chart entry with their second album, 'Songs To <b>Scream</b> <b>At</b> The Sun'.|$|E

Six weeks after enlisting, she {{was sent to the}} discharge unit. She was allegedly being bullied, and in the opinion of another soldier, was having a breakdown. The soldier told The Guardian: [...] "The kid was barely five foot ... He was a runt, so pick on him. He's crazy, pick on him. He's a faggot, pick on him. The guy took it from every side.

Elliott personally inspected the route, talked with officers familiar with it, and drew up a new timetable for the march, managing to get his men across with {{only a handful of}} casualties. On the march, one man forgot the ban on smoking. Elliott characteristically started to <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> the man, even threatening to shoot him. Out from the ranks came a shout: [...] "If you shoot him, I'll shoot you." [...] When the soldier who called out was brought forward and explained that no one talked to his brother like that, Elliott sent the man to his school for non-commissioned officers, with the rationale that anyone who could stand up to himself in full flight clearly had leadership potential.|$|E

By this time, Capper had been lying in her own urine and feces for several days and was placed in a bath {{containing}} concentrated disinfectant and scrubbed with a stiff brush with sufficient force to remove skin. Pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth, which police later found at his house [...] "like some kind of macabre trophy." [...] Dudson said: [...] "I was stood at the doorway with Jeanie [...] and Bernie [...] Cliff [...] took her gag off. He told her to open her mouth. He said: 'Right, I'm going to rip your teeth out'. He started hitting her teeth with the pliers. He got the pliers on and started pulling it out. But it just snapped and chipped. Then he hit them a few more times. He put the pliers on again and really, really pulled. He pulled Suzanne's head forward until there was a snap and he had the tooth in the pliers. He did the same again and he was laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Device {{was charged}} with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, {{together}} with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared {{in the shape of a}} brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
500|$|Williamson had {{attached}} five-page {{proposals for}} potential sequels to Scream when he originally sold the script, hoping to entice prospective buyers into buying a film and a franchise. [...] When Dimension Films bought the script, they secured Williamson for two future Scream films, should the original prove successful. [...] After a highly positive test screening of <b>Scream</b> <b>at</b> which executives from Dimension Films and Miramax were present, Craven was signed {{to direct the}} two future sequels. [...] After the film's box office and critical success, the first sequel was greenlit and sent into production while Scream was still in theaters. The second picture was given an increased budget. The surviving cast—Campbell, Cox, Arquette, Kennedy, and Schreiber—all returned, as well {{as much of the}} original crew, including editor Patrick Lussier and composer Marco Beltrami. [...] A third film followed shortly after, again with the crew and surviving cast returning to create what was, at the time, the concluding film in the Scream trilogy. The three original films, released in a five-year period, followed the story of Sidney Prescott's encounters with a succession of killers adopting the Ghostface disguise. The films also analyze her relationship with her deceased mother, who inadvertently initiates the events depicted in the films. [...] Scream 2 fared as well financially and critically as its predecessor, while Scream 3 fared significantly worse on both counts, with critics deriding the film as having become what the original had so deftly satirized.|$|E

500|$|The opening scene, which {{detailed}} Isabella's {{entrance to}} the school and the foreboding danger that came with it, was described as [...] "classic" [...] Doctor Who by Whithouse as it contained a [...] "victim coming into a trap". Isabella's <b>scream</b> <b>at</b> the end of the scene originally went into the title sequence; however, director Jonny Campbell thought that the next two scenes had [...] "soft endings" [...] that would not work well right after each other. As a result, the title sequence was moved to after the scene of the Doctor crashing Rory's stag party, which Whithouse described as a [...] "fun scene" [...] and a unique opening to the titles. Whithouse also wanted to emphasise the amount of danger the Doctor puts people in, which is pointed out by Rory in the episode. He believed that the companions over time developed the same mentality as the Doctor in running towards the danger, and so Rory was a great opportunity to question that. Whithouse also wanted a [...] "comic thread" [...] to [...] "dilute" [...] the plot and character developments. He also noted that it was difficult to capture Guido's [...] "tragic" [...] character in the running time. The episode also gives a [...] "metatexual" [...] reference by showing a picture of the Doctor's first incarnation on his library card. The references to [...] "silence" [...] in the episode are shown as flashbacks in the episode [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] of the next series, suggesting it was foreshadowing to the enemy of the Silence which were the focus of that episode.|$|E
