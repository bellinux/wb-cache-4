5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed a <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also {{led him to the}} formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> {{renewable}} energy, ranking {{as one of the}} top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that threatening self-aspects that pertain to an identity specified in a binding identity goal leads to distinct com-pensation (i. e., self-symbolizing), whereas threatening self-aspects not specified in a binding identity goal leads to general self-worth restoration. To test this hypothesis, participants with either weak or <b>strong</b> <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> becoming lawyers {{were subjected to}} either a related or unrelated self-threat, and then {{given the opportunity to}} restore both the lawyer identity and gen-eral self-worth. Only participants strongly committed to become lawyers responded to a related self-threat by distinct compen-sation rather than general self-worth restoration.

25|$|Even {{before the}} end of the war in South Asia, the INA prisoners who were falling into Allied hands were being {{evaluated}} by forward intelligence units for potential trials. Almost fifteen hundred had been captured in the battles of Imphal and Kohima and the subsequent withdrawal, while larger numbers surrendered or were captured during the 14th Army's Burma Campaign. A total of 16,000 of the INA's 43,000 recruits were captured, of whom around 11,000 were interrogated by the Combined Services Directorate of Investigation Corps (CSDIC). The number of prisoners necessitated this selective policy which anticipated trials of those with the <b>strongest</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> Bose's ideologies. Those with lesser commitment or other extenuating circumstances would be dealt with more leniently, with the punishment proportional <b>to</b> their <b>commitment</b> or war crimes. For this purpose, the field intelligence units designated the captured troops as Blacks with <b>strongest</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> Azad Hind; Greys with varying commitment but also with enticing circumstances that led them to join the INA; and Whites, those who were pressured into joining the INA under the circumstances but with no <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> Azad Hind, INA, or Bose.|$|R
