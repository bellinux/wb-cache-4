25|$|Cruzado defended MSU's {{hiring and}} {{retention}} practices. In the 2012-2013 school year, she said, MSU paid $178,000 in retention salary bonuses and paid $1.35 million to provide equipment, materials, staff, and travel. Fourteen retention packages were offered to faculty; eight stayed, one left, and five were undecided. That compared, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2008-2009 school year, {{in which only}} five faculty were offered retention packages totalling $521,000 (all five stayed). MSU also won state matching funds for all federal EPSCoR monies received, and now also offers bonuses to faculty who win research funding that adds at least 25 percent to their base salary. The university also {{increased the number of}} paid graduate assistants to 616 from 540 in the past two years, and added 12 more in the 2012-2013 school year.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{match was}} in the Round of 32, which was an {{elimination}} round, on 3 August, the seventh day of competition at the Olympics. [...] Wearing white, she lost to Puerto Rican Melissa Mojica in 82 seconds, lasting longer than the shortest match in her weight class, which lasted 48 seconds where Mika Sugimoto of Japan beat Maria Suelen Altheman of Brazil. The match was refereed by Wilian Rosquet, and judged by Young Chun Jeon and Cathy Mouette. [...] There were no penalties awarded in the match. After the match, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press (in Arabic): [...] "I am happy {{to be at the}} Olympics. Unfortunately, we did not win a medal, but in the future we will and I will be a star for women's participation." [...] She also stated that, because she was not accustomed to fighting in such large tournaments and because of the debate over the hijab, it had been difficult for her to focus on the competition. Despite this, she clarified that she was happy to have participated and planned to continue to practise judo in the future. Although her fight was not televised live on any local Saudi television channels, it was available within the Kingdom on several satellite networks broadcasting {{from other parts of the}} Arab world.|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E

2500|$|Preceding the Queen into Westminster Abbey was St. Edward's Crown, {{carried into}} the abbey by the Lord High Steward of England, then [...] the Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, who was {{flanked by two}} other peers, while the Archbishops and Bishops Assistant of the Church of England, in their copes and mitres, waited outside the Great West Door {{for the arrival of}} the Queen. When the Queen arrived at about 11:00a.m., she found that the {{friction}} between her robes and the carpet caused her difficulty moving forward, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, [...] "Get me started!" [...] Once going, the procession, which included the various High Commissioners of the Commonwealth carrying banners bearing the shields of the coats of arms of their respective nations, moved inside the abbey, up the central aisle and through the choir to the stage, as the choirs sang [...] "I was glad", an imperial setting of Psalm 122, vv. 1–3, 6, and 7 by Sir Hubert Parry. As Elizabeth prayed at and then seated herself on the Chair of Estate to the south of the altar, the Bishops carried in the religious paraphernalia—the bible, paten and chalice—and the peers holding the coronation regalia handed them over to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who, in turn, passed them to the Dean of Westminster, Alan Campbell Don, to be placed on the altar.|$|E
