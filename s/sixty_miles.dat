The Prophecy of Berchán has it that he was wounded and died at Scone, <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> to the south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E

25|$|For {{thousands}} of years {{before the arrival of}} European settlers, the area now known as San Jose was inhabited by several groups of Ohlone Native Americans. Permanent European presence in the area came with the 1770 founding of the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo by Gaspar de Portolà and Junípero Serra, about <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> (100km) to the south. Don Pedro Fages, the military governor at Monterey, passed through the area on his 1770 and 1772 expeditions to explore the East Bay and Sacramento River Delta.|$|E

60|$|This {{time the}} trail was easier. It was better packed, {{and they were}} not {{carrying}} mail against time. The day's run was shorter, and likewise the hours on trail. On his mail run Daylight had played out three Indians; but his present partners knew that they must not be played out when they arrived at the Stewart bars, so they set the slower pace. And under this milder toil, where his companions nevertheless grew weary, Daylight recuperated and rested up. At Forty Mile they laid over two days {{for the sake of the}} dogs, and at <b>Sixty</b> <b>Mile</b> Daylight's team was left with the trader. Unlike Daylight, after the terrible run from Selkirk to Circle City, they had been unable to recuperate on the back trail. So the four men pulled on from <b>Sixty</b> <b>Mile</b> with a fresh team of dogs on Daylight's sled.|$|R
25|$|Jennings was conciliatory towards Harrison, and in 1821 Harrison was {{appointed}} {{as a member}} of the committee who platted Indianapolis for the new state capitol. Harrison was the only member of the commission who arrived on time to the location that was <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> into the wilderness. The other commissioners were long delayed in reaching the site, and Harrison, being a practical man, decided he formed a majority of the present commissioners and voted to begin laying out the town without them. He choose Alexander Ralston, who had been an assistant to Pierre Charles L’Enfant, to survey the site.|$|E
25|$|Flagler {{originally}} intended West Palm Beach {{to be the}} terminus of his railroad system, but in 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit the area, causing Flagler to reconsider. <b>Sixty</b> <b>miles</b> south, the area today known as Miami was reportedly unharmed by the freeze. To further convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, he was offered land in exchange for laying rail tracks from private landowners, the Florida East Coast Canal and Transportation Company, and the Boston and Florida Atlantic Coast Land Company. The land owners were Julia Tuttle, whom he had met in Cleveland, Ohio, and William Brickell, who ran a trading post on the Miami River.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September, Graziani struck: his leading {{divisions}} advanced <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> into Egypt {{where they}} reached the town of Sidi Barrani and, short of supplies, began to dig in. O'Connor then began {{to prepare for a}} counterattack. He had the 7th Armoured Division and the Indian 4th Infantry Division along with two brigades. British and Commonwealth troops in Egypt totalled around 36,000 men. The Italians had nearly five times as many troops along with hundreds more tanks and artillery pieces and the support of a much larger air force. Meanwhile, small raiding columns were sent out from the 7th Armoured and newly formed Long Range Desert Group to probe, harass, and disrupt the Italians (this marked the start of what became the Special Air Services). The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force supported by bombarding enemy strongpoints, airfields and rear areas.|$|E

25|$|One of Estrada Cabrera's {{most famous}} and most bitter {{legacies}} was allowing the entry of the United Fruit Company into the Guatemalan economical and political arena. As {{a member of the}} Liberal Party, he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of highways, railroads, and sea ports for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency, there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of Puerto Barrios to the capital, Guatemala City. Yet due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the United Fruit Company {{was the only way to}} get finish the railway. Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's Minor Cooper Keith in 1904 that gave the company tax-exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the real}} reason for the Hellgate treaty {{meetings}} became clear to the Salish and Pend d'Oreille people. Under the terms spelled out in the written document, the tribes ceded to the United States more than twenty million acres (81,000km²) of land and reserved from cession about 1.3 million acres (5300km²), thus forming the Jocko or Flathead Indian Reservation. Conditions had become intolerable for the Salish by the late 1880s, after the Missoula and Bitter Root Valley Railroad was constructed directly through the tribe's lands, with neither permission from the native owners nor payment to them. Charlot finally signed an agreement to leave the Bitterroot Valley in November 1889. Inaction by Congress, however, delayed the removal for another two years, and according to some observers, the tribe's desperation reached a level of outright starvation. In October 1891, a contingent of troops from Fort Missoula forced Charlot and the Salish out of the Bitterroot and roughly marched the small band <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> to the Flathead Reservation.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, about <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on {{the receipt}} of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case may be), just to look at if.|$|E

25|$|Attempts at border-blasting were {{somewhat}} more common {{on the other}} side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. WIVB-TV, prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller market than Southern Ontario, which boasts the major world city of Toronto); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF low band (channel 4), even after the Federal Communications Commission reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station WKBW-TV did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting Winnipeg, a much larger city <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York found it could reach a larger audience in Montreal. Canadian regulators put in simultaneous substitution requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba-based CKND-TV; Burlington station WFFF-TV entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed).|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some <b>sixty</b> <b>miles,</b> but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, after {{completing}} his mission on the Tennessee River, Phelps ascended the Cumberland River for <b>sixty</b> <b>miles</b> to investigate {{reports of a}} fort (Donelson) being built above the town of Eddyville. Upon discovering that a Confederate cavalry were harassing Unionists in town, he gave a stern warning to the townspeople to desist, or that he would return with force. Keeping his word, he returned twelve days later, on October 26, with three regiments from the Ninth Regiment of Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Major Jesse Phillips, all on board the Lake Erie No.2. In his report of October 28, Phelps reported to Foote that the Confederates had a system of communication between Eddyville and Smithland which employed the use of runners. Phelps reported, that {{under cover of darkness}} he slowly maneuvered his vessel to a point on the river near the town of Eddyville, where Phillips' companies disembarked, marched seven miles inland, and discovered a rebel encampment; Philips' Union volunteers commenced firing upon the Confederates and then charged with bayonets, scattering the rebels in retreat. Phelps reported that in the mean time he deployed a line of picket-guards around the town to prevent any escape of messengers leaving with dispatches of warning, and to prevent any refugees from the rebel camp coming there to hide. After the battle there were only four Union volunteers wounded, with some horses perishing during the battle. Captured were twenty-four prisoners, seven negroes, two transport wagons, thirty-four horses, and a flatboat upon which the prisoners were transported. An assortment of other supplies were also seized. Phelps closed his report to Foote with praise and respect for Major Phillips and his volunteers.|$|E

60|$|The {{tail of the}} ice-run passed, and for {{the first}} time in six months Daylight saw open water. He knew that the ice had not yet passed out from the upper reaches of the Stewart, that it lay in packs and jams in those upper reaches, and that it might break loose and come down in a second run any time; but the need was too desperate for him to linger. Elijah was so far gone that he might pass at any moment. As for himself, he was not sure that enough {{strength}} remained in his wasted muscles to launch the boat. It was all a gamble. If he waited for the second ice-run, Elijah would surely die, and most probably himself. If he succeeded in launching the boat, if he kept ahead of the second ice-run, if he did not get caught by some of the runs from the upper Yukon; if luck favored in all these essential particulars, as well as in a score of minor ones, they would reach <b>Sixty</b> <b>Mile</b> and be saved, if--and again the if--he had strength enough to land the boat at <b>Sixty</b> <b>Mile</b> and not go by.|$|R
