60|$|Last January, {{when we were}} {{beginning}} to inquire about a home for this summer, I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said, three years before, that the New Hampshire highlands was a good place. He was right--it was a good place. Any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an artist in morals and ink. Brush <b>is</b> here, too; <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Col. T. W.

5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, <b>so</b> <b>were</b> magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E

5|$|In the {{gymnastics}} events {{there were}} three athletes placed first for the men's pommel horse, with Paavo Aaltonen, Veikko Huhtanen and Heikki Savolainen all receiving gold medals for Finland in the same event, while no silver or bronze medals were handed out.

5|$|Much Middle Scots {{literature}} {{was produced by}} makars, poets with links to the royal court. These included James I who wrote The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas {{have been seen as}} leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E

Besides, for further encouragement, read Jeremiah 3, 33:25,26, 51:5, Ezekiel 36:25, Hosea 14:1-4; and stay thyself, and wonder at the riches of the grace of God.|$|R

5|$|The {{operation}} did affect German {{analysis of}} Allied troop strength. In early 1944 the Allies had 38 {{divisions in the}} region, but the German battle plan identified up to 71.

5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down upon and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> the {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, and brass bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> of the same nature as other birds.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do <b>so</b> <b>were</b> punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and <b>so</b> <b>were</b> not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups in Maryland and New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, and sites along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do <b>so</b> <b>were</b> introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to create the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, consisting of federal lands on Maryland's Eastern Shore at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
