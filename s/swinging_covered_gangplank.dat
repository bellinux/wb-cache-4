40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the three {{lifestyle}} magazines Honey, Nova and London Life and their coverage of two central aspects of the 1960 s in Britain; fashion and Swinging London as a phenomenon and possibly a myth.

Through this thesis I am analysing how they wrote about these ccentral themes, and by using other sources such as oral interviews and published books I am trying to analyse {{the impact of the}} magazines upon the fashion industry, as well as their attitudes to London as the swinging city. Each magazine had a targeted audience that differed from the other two magazines, and while many historians and sociologists have focused on women’s magazines in general, few have chosen to analyse how the magazines <b>covered</b> <b>Swinging</b> London.

Although the bank provided a centralized mechanism of trade accounting and <b>swing</b> credits to <b>cover</b> temporary imbalances, it could not establish a system of multilateral clearing because of the centrally planned nature of the members' economies and the inconvertibility of their currencies.

40|$|Optimized {{interaction}} of the brain with environment requires the four-dimensional representation of space-time in the neuronal circuits. Information processing {{is an important part}} of this interaction, which is critically dependent on time-dimension. Information processing has played an important role in the evolution of mammals, and has reached a level of critical importance in the lives of primates, particularly the humans. The entanglement of time-dimension with information processing in the brain is not clearly understood at present. Time-dimension in physical world – the environment of an organism – can be represented by the interval of a pendulum <b>swing</b> (the <b>cover</b> page depicts temporal unit with the help of a swinging pendulum). Temporal units in neural processes are represented by regular activities of pacemaker neurons, tonic regular activities of proprioceptors and periodic fluctuations in the excitability of neurons underlying brain oscillations. Moreover, temporal units may be representationally associated with time-bins containing bits of information (see the Editorial), which may be studied to understand the entanglement of time-dimension with neural information processing. The optimized {{interaction of}} the brain with environment requires the calibration of neural temporal units. Neural temporal units are calibrated as a result of feedback processes occurring during the interaction of an organism with environment. Understanding the role of time-dimension in the brain information processing requires a multidisciplinary approach, which would include psychophysics, single cell studies and brain recordings. Although this Special Issue has helped us move forward on some fronts, including theoretical understanding of calibration of time-information in neural circuits, and the role of brain oscillations in timing functions and integration of asynchronous sensory information, further advancements are needed by developing correct computational tools to resolve the relationship between dynamic, hierarchical neural oscillatory structures that form during the brain’s interaction with environment...|$|R

Indeed, for one long level stretch she and Glenn held hands. When they arrived at the descent, which necessitated slow and careful riding, she was hot and tingling and breathless, worked by the action into an exuberance of pleasure. Glenn complimented her riding as well as her rosy cheeks. There was indeed a sweetness in working at a task as she had worked to learn to ride in Western fashion. Every turn of her mind seemed to confront her with sobering antitheses of thought. Why had she come to love to ride down a lonely desert road, through ragged cedars where the wind whipped her face with fragrant wild breath, if {{at the same time she}} hated the West? Could she hate a country, however barren and rough, if it had saved the health and happiness of her future husband? Verily there were problems for Carley to solve.|$|R
