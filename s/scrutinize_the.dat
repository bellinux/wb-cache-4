5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
25|$|There were {{concerns}} that the Thanom-appointed parliament would be inappropriate for approving the draft.

25|$|However, {{once the}} {{decision-maker}} has {{taken into account}} the relevant considerations, the courts are reluctant to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> {{manner in which the}} decision-maker balances the considerations. This can be gleaned from the case of R. v. Boundary Commission for England, ex parte Foot (1983), where the Court of Appeal of England and Wales was unwilling to overrule certain recommendations of the Commission as it had rightfully taken all the correct considerations laid down in the relevant statute. The Court emphasized that the weighing of those relevant considerations was a matter for the Commission, not the courts.|$|E
25|$|Jurors are {{generally}} {{required to keep}} their deliberations in strict confidence during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In English law, the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict {{is considered to be}} contempt of court, a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.|$|E
25|$|The Senate (not the judiciary) is {{the sole}} judge of a senator's {{qualifications}}. During its early years, however, the Senate did not closely <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> qualifications of its members. As a result, three senators who {{failed to meet the}} age requirement were nevertheless admitted to the Senate: Henry Clay (aged 29 in 1806), Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D. Holt Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29; he waited until he turned 30 (on the next June 19) to take the oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|Metallurgist Terry Heaslip of the Canadian company Accident Investigation and Research Inc. {{examined}} the aircraft {{skin from the}} tail and found signs of overheating, specifically that the skin had been repeatedly flexed, through a phenomenon known as flutter. This caused investigators to further <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> tail of the aircraft. Furthermore, the investigation team found that the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), {{which was in the}} tail, generated heat which melted certain plastic parts, indicating that the APU was operating during the flight even though it normally would not be. The mechanic who had inspected the aircraft {{on the day of the}} accident flight told the investigators that one of the aircraft's two main generators had failed and that he was not able to repair the faulty generator. The investigators discovered that the pilots had noted in the flight log that they operated the APU during the flight, since two power sources are required for flight. They also discovered that the front APU mount was broken, which allowed it to vibrate excessively.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, the Department of Defense {{continued}} to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> reserve forces. It questioned {{the number of}} divisions and brigades, {{as well as the}} redundancy of maintaining two reserve components, the National Guard and the Army Reserve. In 1967, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided that 15 combat divisions in the Army National Guard were unnecessary. He cut the number to eight divisions (one mechanized infantry, two armored, and five infantry), but increased the number of brigades from seven to 18 (one airborne, one armored, two mechanized infantry, and 14 infantry). The loss of the divisions did not set well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them. Under the proposal, the remaining division commanders were to reside {{in the state of the}} division base. No reduction, however, in total Army National Guard strength was to take place, which convinced the governors to accept the plan. The states reorganized their forces accordingly between 1 December 1967 and 1 May 1968.|$|E
500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album {{on the basis of the}} group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the power}} shuffle, in 1805, Bhimsen became the {{architect}} of an unpopular plan of seizing all the tax free land granted to temple guthis and as birta to Brahmin priests in order to fill the empty state coffers. [...] The objective was to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> cases in which tax exempt lands had been used without valid documentary proof of land grant by a benefactor; owners with valid evidence or owners who could take an oath of validity were not affected. The money was spent in financing the military campaigns in the far west in Jamuna-Sutlej region. This was a very radical reform in the staunchly religious society {{of the time and}} became known as Baisathi Haran in the Nepalese history.|$|E
500|$|The University of Toulouse (founded in 1229) {{tried to}} {{capitalise}} {{on the situation}} by advertising itself to students: [...] "Those who wish to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> bosom of nature to the inmost can hear the books of Aristotle which were forbidden at Paris." [...] However, whether the prohibition had actually {{had an effect on}} the study of the physical texts in Paris is unclear. English scholars, including Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon, studied at Paris, when they could have chosen to study at the University of Oxford, where the works could still be discussed in public. It is assumed that at the least they continued to be read in Paris in private, and there are also signs that their discussion had become public by 1240.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigations}} and surveillance would, in part, assess how the anti-Vietnam War movement could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also {{anticipated that the}} Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a private investigation firm led by former Department of Justice officials who had served under Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat and former Attorney General. Caulfield noted that this firm {{had the potential to}} employ [...] "formidable and sophisticated" [...] intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it. The plan would involve black bag operations, targeting political enemies of the campaign. Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits. The Sandwedge proposal also included a list of people willing to work with Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of Inland Revenue, and a former sheriff of Cook County, Illinois.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{married his}} high-school {{sweetheart}} Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived {{together in a}} small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off 6th Avenue just north of Greenwich Village. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art and the cinemas of New York City. He {{was inspired by the}} complex, fluid camerawork of the director Max Ophüls, whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director Elia Kazan, whom he described as America's [...] "best director" [...] at that time, with his ability of [...] "performing miracles" [...] with his actors. Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughn, observed that Kubrick would <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking. He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes. Sergei Eisenstein's theoretical writings {{had a profound impact on}} Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of Arthur Rothstein, the photographic technical director of Look magazine.|$|E
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{writes that}} the film is deeper than its predecessor, with a [...] "deft" [...] script that refuses to <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> Joker with popular psychology, instead pulling the viewer in with an {{examination}} of Bruce Wayne's psyche. Travers praised all the cast, saying each brings his or her [...] "'A' game" [...] to the film. He says Bale is [...] "electrifying," [...] evoking Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II, that Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent is [...] "scarily moving", and that Oldman [...] "is so skilled that he makes virtue exciting as Jim Gordon". Travers says Ledger moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholson's interpretation into darker territory, and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy Award, Travers says that the filmmakers move the film away from comic book cinema and closer to being a genuine work of art, citing Nolan's direction and the [...] "gritty reality" [...] of Wally Pfister's cinematography as helping to create a universe that has something [...] "raw and elemental" [...] at work within it. In particular, he cites Nolan's action choreography in the IMAX-tailored heist sequence as rivaling that of Heat (1995). Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Every great hero needs a great villain. And in 2008, Christian Bale's Batman found his in Heath Ledger's demented dervish, the Joker." [...] BBC critic Mark Kermode, in a positive review, said that Ledger is [...] "very, very good" [...] but that Oldman's turn is [...] "the best performance in the film, by a mile"; Kermode felt Oldman was deserving of an Oscar nomination.|$|E
