5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around {{about the time of}} Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.|$|E
5|$|While both {{settings}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Madonna's characters live in {{the barrio}} and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

Recent studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> regulating these dimorphisms has implications for understanding normal and abnormal brain function. Sexual dimorphisms may be significantly influenced by sex-based brain gene expression which varies from species to species.|$|E

The scattering of cults of the sun god in Sicyon, Argos, Ermioni, Epidaurus and Laconia, and his holy livestock flocks at Taenarum, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the deity was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared {{to other parts of}} ancient Greece.

Several Akkadian proverbs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they may have also engaged in homosexual intercourse. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian hijra. In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.|$|E

25|$|The {{names of}} their kings, such as Ambiorix and Catuvolcus, are {{undoubtedly}} Celtic.

They were not so strongly linked to the east of the Rhine.

25|$|Around 80 BC, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, {{possibly}} a {{general in the}} service of the Indo-Greeks, ruled for a few years in northwestern India before the Indo-Greeks again took control. He seems to have been married to an Indo-Greek princess named Machene. King Hippostratus (65–55 BC) seems to have been one of the most successful subsequent Indo-Greek kings until he lost to the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established an Indo-Scythian dynasty in 48/47 BC. Various coins <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> some sort of alliance may have taken place between the Indo-Greeks and the Scythians.|$|E
25|$|Some studies <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the longer}} {{a patient is}} on {{dialysis}} before the transplant, the less time the kidney will last. It is not clear why this occurs, but it underscores the need for rapid referral to a transplant program. Ideally, a kidney transplant should be pre-emptive, i.e., take place before the patient begins dialysis. The reason why kidneys fail over time after transplantation has been elucidated in recent years. Apart from recurrence of the original kidney disease, also rejection (mainly antibody-mediated rejection) and progressive scarring (multifactorial) play a decisive role. Avoiding rejection by strict medication adherence is of utmost importance to avoid failure of the kidney transplant.|$|E

Prison records have it that, since 1959, he had been under medical supervision for hypertonia.

500|$|By far {{the most}} {{explosive}} growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) {{has been in the}} genera Microcebus and Lepilemur. In 2006, 15new species of Lepilemur were described, with three new species reported in February, one in June, and 11 in September. [...] Since then, three additional species have been described, one of {{which turned out to be}} identical to a previously described species. Genetic and morphological differences <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they are cryptic species, but there is still debate whether these merit full species status or should be regarded as subspecies of previously identified, [...] "core" [...] species.|$|E
500|$|The {{pterosaur}} {{wing membrane}} {{is divided into}} three basic units. The first, called the propatagium ("first membrane"), was the forward-most part of the wing and attached between the wrist and shoulder, creating the [...] "leading edge" [...] during flight. This membrane may have incorporated the first three fingers of the hand, as evidenced in some specimens. The brachiopatagium ("arm membrane") was the primary component of the wing, stretching from the highly elongated fourth finger of the hand to the hind limbs (though where exactly on the hind limbs it anchored is controversial and may have varied between species, see below). Finally, at least some pterosaur groups had a membrane that stretched between the legs, possibly connecting to or incorporating the tail, called the uropatagium; the extent of this membrane is not certain, as studies on Sordes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it simply connected the legs but did not involve the tail (rendering it a cruropatagium). It is generally agreed though that non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs had a broader uro/cruropatagium, with pterodactyloids only having membranes running along the legs.|$|E
