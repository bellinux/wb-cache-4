5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, at the {{beginning}} of the post-World War II high fidelity (hi-fi) popularity, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) developed a standard playback curve. This was intended for use by hi-fi amplifier manufacturers. If records were engineered to <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> on hi-fi amplifiers using the AES curve, this would be a worthy goal towards standardization. This curve was defined by the time constants of audio filters and had a bass turnover of 400Hz and a 10,000Hz rolloff of −12dB.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't <b>sound</b> <b>good.</b> It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

500|$|The {{chemistry}} between Cornell and {{the other}} three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: [...] "He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

[...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show."

500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the {{planning}} of the manga, Araki intended to depict Dio as a [...] "cool" [...] character who descends into villainy. Thinking that it could be difficult to create an evil antagonist that readers would empathize with, Araki wrote Dio as coming from a poor family with a father [...] "with no redeeming qualities whatsoever", giving Dio motivation to acquire power and get revenge on the world even if it led him to do immoral and illegal things. Araki also noted that a character who acts without regard for morals and laws can give readers a feeling of catharsis due to exhibiting the same [...] "ugly feelings" [...] people hold but cannot show, making Dio more easily relatable than a character who only does good. Dio's name was taken directly from the Italian word for [...] "god", and was chosen to <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> together with the name [...] "JoJo".|$|E

500|$|Actress Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith Palmer, {{attributed}} {{her love of}} the episode to Craig Robinson, because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode [...] "Basketball". She explained, [...] "We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer. We <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> together, but sometimes people {{are not in the}} mood to hear our amazing duets, mostly from the '80s." [...] Flannery believed that Robinson's performance in the episode was [...] "very funny," [...] as his character served as a [...] "great foil for Michael Scott." [...] "The Negotiation" [...] featured the return of character Andy Bernard, who had last been seen in the episode [...] "The Return", as he was attending anger management classes. At the time [...] "The Return" [...] aired, no one was certain Helms would be returning, but in early February, NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine complimented the remix stating: [...] " [...] might replace André 3000's {{typically}} great guest feature {{with one}} from J. Cole, but hey, anyone can <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> over this beat. And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this really should have been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October seems like an odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July." [...] The remix was nominated in the category for Best Collaboration at the 2012 BET Awards. For the week ending November 5, 2011, [...] "Party" [...] debuted at number two on the South Korean International Singles Chart, selling 85,143 digital downloads. It became the seventy third best-selling single in South Korea in 2011.|$|E

Time and time again one comes across statements that look, and <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don't stand up to analysis." [...] The reviewer cited examples, like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates. Nick Rennison reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, writing that [...] "any writer who can take subjects as diverse as ....and find something original and interesting to say about each of them, has to be worth reading." ...|$|E
