Who shall ring round those feet swifter than the <b>Sassaby</b> of the plains? Wow! He is here! He is there! He is a sorcerer! Death is in his hand, and death looks out of his eyes! ...|$|E
60|$|Ah! what a {{ride was}} that. Had ever man the like of it? Rushing down an untrodden {{mountain}} way swifter than others dare travel on a plain, bounding from rock to rock like a buck, dashing through streams, and leaping dim gullies at a stride. On, on went the schimmel, with never a slip and never a stumble. On, swifter than a <b>sassaby</b> and surer-footed than a fox; now {{the worst of}} the road was passed, and a long, smooth slope, almost free from stones, led them to the grassy plain beneath. The schimmel swept down it at a fearful pace and reached the level land in safety, but the strain of that mad gallop told its tale upon him, for he was drenched with sweat, his eye was red with blood, and the breath whistled in his throat.|$|E
60|$|Ah! I tell you, my child, the veldt {{in those}} days was {{different}} indeed from what it is now. The land itself remains the same except where white men have built towns upon it, but all else is changed. Then it was black with game when the grass was green; yes, at times I have seen it so black for miles that we could scarcely see the grass. There were all sorts of them, springbucks in myriads, blesbok and quagga and wildebeeste in thousands, sable antelope, <b>sassaby</b> and hartebeeste in herds, eland, giraffe and koodoo in troops; while the forests were full of elephant and the streams of sea-cow. They are all gone now, the beautiful wild creatures; the guns of the white men have killed them out or driven them away, and I suppose that it is as well that they are gone, for while the game is in such plenty the men will not work. Still I for one am sorry to lose the sight of them, and {{had it not been for}} their numbers we Boers should never have lasted through that long trek, for often and often we lived upon buck's flesh and little else for weeks together.|$|E
50|$|Damaliscus, {{known as}} <b>sassabies,</b> is a genus of {{antelope}} {{in the family}} Bovidae, subfamily Alcelaphinae, found in Africa.|$|R
5|$|Like the <b>sassabies,</b> {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and <b>sassabies),</b> and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the <b>sassabies</b> (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|R

'My Father,' he answered, 'I {{have a word}} to tell thee, but I cannot {{speak it}} before these low people (umfagozana),' and {{he glanced at the}} Wakwafi Askari; 'it is for thine own ear. My Father, this will I say,' and here his face grew stern again, 'a woman betrayed me to the death, and covered my name with shame -- ay, my own wife, a round-faced girl, betrayed me; but I escaped from death; ay, I broke from the very hands of those who came to slay me. I struck but three blows with this mine axe Inkosikaas -- surely my Father will {{remember}} it -- one to the right, one to the left, and one in front, and yet I left three men dead. And then I fled, and, as my Father knows, even now that I am old my feet are as the feet of the <b>Sassaby</b> {Endnote 2}, and there breathes not the man who, by running, can touch me again when once I have bounded from his side. On I sped, and after me came the messengers of death, and their voice was as the voice of dogs that hunt. From my own kraal I flew, and, as I passed, she who had betrayed me was drawing water from the spring. I fleeted by her like the shadow of Death, and as I went I smote with mine axe, and lo! her head fell: it fell into the water pan. Then I fled north. Day after day I journeyed on; for three moons I journeyed, resting not, stopping not, but running on towards forgetfulness, till I met the party of the white hunter who is now dead, and am come hither with his servants. And nought have I brought with me. I who was high-born, ay, of the blood of Chaka, the great king -- a chief, and a captain of the regiment of the Nkomabakosi -- am a wanderer in strange places, a man without a kraal. Nought have I brought save this mine axe; of all my belongings this remains alone. They have divided my cattle; they have taken my wives; and my children know my face no more. Yet with this axe' -- and he swung the formidable weapon round his head, making the air hiss as he clove it -- 'will I cut another path to fortune. I have spoken.' ...|$|E
50|$|The common tsessebe or <b>sassaby</b> (Damaliscus lunatus lunatus) {{is one of}} five {{subspecies}} of African antelope Damaliscus lunatus of {{the genus}} Damaliscus and subfamily Alcelaphinae in the family Bovidae. It is most closely related to the topi, korrigum, coastal topi and tiang (all subspecies of Damaliscus lunatus), and the bangweulu tsessebe and bontebok in the same genus. Tsessebe are found primarily in Angola, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and South Africa. Tsessebe can run at a maximum of 80 km/h.|$|E
40|$|Main articleA {{short history}} of palaeontological work in the Makapan Valley is given and {{the setting of the}} fossil {{material}} is briefly described. Many hundreds of bovid cranial and dental fragments have been recovered, in addition to thousands of bones and bone fragments. The post-cranial material is not considered in the present account. The collection includes a number of species not separable from the living kudu, nyala, eland, Cape buffalo, blue duiker, mountain reedbuck, gemsbok, <b>sassaby,</b> brindled gnu and impala. Known extinct species include cf. Alcelaphus robustus, cf. Pelorocerus helmes and Oreotragus major. A new genus of aberrant Alcelaphine is described as Makapania broomi. Other new species are Cephalophus pricei, Redunca darti, Gazella gracilior, and Phenacotragus vanhoepeni. A feature of the assemblage is the tendency for species to be larger than their living counterparts. The whole described fauna of the deposits is discussed and it is considered that a lower Pleistocene (probably Villafranchian) age is most likely. the Royal Society, the Nuffield Foundation, Wenner-Gren Foundatio...|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} hartebeest is Alcelaphus buselaphus. First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, it is classified in the genus Alcelaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. In 1979, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported Sigmoceros as a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest, a kind of hartebeest, as she assumed it was related to Connochaetes (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein's hartebeest with Connochaetes. However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, who classified it as an independent species of Alcelaphus. Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of A. buselaphus. Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An MtDNA analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest. It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic, and discovered close affinity between the Alcelaphus and the <b>sassabies</b> (genus Damaliscus)â€”both genetically and morphologically.|$|R
