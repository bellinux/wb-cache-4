40|$|Background: Type 1 {{narcolepsy}} is {{a neurological}} disorder characterized by {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} and cataplexy associated with the HLA allele DQB 1 * 06 : 02. Genetic predisposition along with external triggering factors may drive autoimmune responses, ultimately leading to the selective loss of hypocretin-positive neurons. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate potential aetiological factors in Swedish cases of postvaccination (Pandemrix) narcolepsy defined by interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) production from immune cells in response to molecularly defined targets. Methods: Cellular reactivity defined by IFNÎ³ production was examined in blood from 38 (HLA-DQB 1 * 06 : 02 +) Pandemrix-vaccinated narcolepsy cases and 76 (23 HLA-DQB 1 * 06 : 02 +and 53 HLA-DQB 1 * 06 : 02 -) control subjects, matched for age, sex and exposure, using a variety of different antigens: Î²-haemolytic group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens (M 5, M 6 and <b>streptodornase</b> B), influenza (the pandemic A/H 1 N 1 /California/ 7 / 09 NYMC X- 179 A and A/H 1 N 1 /California/ 7 / 09 NYMC X- 181 vaccine antigens, previous Flu-A and -B vaccine targets, A/H 1 N 1 /Brisbane/ 59 / 2007, A/H 1 N 1 /Solomon Islands/ 3 / 2006, A/H 3 N 2 /Uruguay/ 716 / 2007, A/H 3 N 2 /Wisconsin/ 67 / 2005, A/H 5 N 1 /Vietnam/ 1203 / 2004 and B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004), noninfluenza viral targets (CMVpp 65, EBNA- 1 and EBNA- 3) and auto-antigens (hypocretin peptide, Tribbles homolog 2 peptide cocktail and extract from rat hypothalamus tissue). Results: IFN-Î³ production was significantly increased in whole blood from narcolepsy cases in response to streptococcus serotype M 6 (PÂ =Â  0. 0065) and <b>streptodornase</b> B protein (PÂ =Â  0. 0050).

In the present case, the following aspects of the disease are reported: clinical, biologic, bacteriologic (Corynebacterium anaerobium), microscopic and electronic pathology.

Immunologic study indicates only slightly abnormal status of the humoral immune response, contrasting with the deeply depressed cell mediated immune reactions. There is a negative candidin and streptokinase <b>streptodornase</b> (SKD) skin test. The in vitro lymphocyte culture demonstrates a greatly reduced response to PHA and an abnormally low secretion of MIF (migration inhibitory factor) in response to SKD. There are very few IgA plasmocytes in the intestinal mucosa. After 1 yr therapy, the only improved test of cell mediated immunity is the MIF response.

40|$|Two-component gene {{regulatory}} systems {{composed of a}} membrane-bound sensor and cytoplasmic response regulator are important mechanisms used by bacteria to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Group A Streptococcus, the causative agent of mild infections and life-threatening invasive diseases, produces many virulence factors that promote survival in humans. A two-component regulatory system, designated covRS (cov, control of virulence; csrRS), negatively controls expression of five proven or putative virulence factors (capsule, cysteine protease, streptokinase, streptolysin S, and <b>streptodornase).</b> Inactivation of covRS results in enhanced virulence in mouse models of invasive disease. Using DNA microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR, we found that CovR influences transcription of 15 % (n = 271) of all chromosomal genes, including many that encode surface and secreted proteins mediating host–pathogen interactions. CovR also plays {{a central role in}} gene regulatory networks by influencing expression of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, including other two-component systems.

All bovine and all human isolates carried a fraction of the 220 genes (23 % and 39 %, respectively). The virulence genes encoding streptolysin S, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, the plasminogen-binding M-like protein PAM, and the collagen-like protein SclB were detected in the majority of both bovine and human isolates (94 to 100 %). Virulence factors, usually carried by human beta-hemolytic streptococcal pathogens, such as streptokinase, laminin-binding protein, and the C 5 a peptidase precursor, were detected in all human isolates but not in bovine isolates. Additionally, GAS bacteriophage-associated virulence genes encoding superantigens, DNase, and/or <b>streptodornase</b> were detected in bovine isolates (72 %) but not in the human isolates. Determinants located in non-bacteriophage-related mobile elements, such as the gene encoding R 28, were detected in all bovine and human isolates. Several virulence genes, including genes of bacteriophage origin, were shown to be expressed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of superantigen gene sequences revealed a high level (> 98 %) of identity among genes of bovine GCS, of the horse pathogen Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and of the human pathogen GAS.

The reactions were assessed by skinfold thickness and skin histology 30 min [...] 7 days after inoculation. Control medium caused slight cellular reaction, mostly polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs), but no significant increase in skinfold thickness. SK/SD provoked no reaction. PHA stimulated a marked increase in skinfold thickness; the cellular reaction was predominantly PMNs, with some macrophages occurring after several days. IFA and CFA promoted a long-lasting increase in skinfold thickness, and a mixed histological picture of PMNs and macrophages; later in the response, especially to CFA, giant cells and some lymphocytes occurred. PPD stimulated a small increase in skinfold thickness with a timing (2 - 3 days) consistent with delayed hypersensitivity (DTH); there was, however, no erythema or palpable oedema or induration. The histology was an initial multifocal reaction of PMNs with a later phase of lymphocytes and macrophages with some granuloma formation. Other cell types (eosinophils, basophils) were seen in varying proportions in all reaction sites. M. bovis was isolated from four badgers; the cellular reaction to PPD was stronger than in uninfected animals, but other aspects of the skin response were unaffected.

40|$|The genome of {{the highly}} virulent group A Streptococcus (GAS) {{serotype}} M 3 strain MGAS 315 has six prophages that encode six proven or putative virulence factors. We examined prophage induction and expression of prophage-encoded virulence factors by this strain under in vitro conditions inferred to approximate in vivo conditions. Coculture of strain MGAS 315 with Detroit 562 (D 562) human epithelial pharyngeal cells induced the prophage encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin K (SpeK) and extracellular phospholipase A 2 (Sla) and the prophage encoding <b>streptodornase</b> (Sdn). Increased gene copy numbers after induction correlated with increased speK, sla, and sdn transcript levels. Although speK and sla are located contiguously in prophage Φ 315. 4, these genes were transcribed independently. Whereas production of immunoreactive SpeK was either absent or minimal during coculture of GAS with D 562 cells, production of immunoreactive Sla increased substantially. In contrast, {{despite a lack of}} induction of the prophage encoding speA during coculture of GAS with D 562 cells, the speA transcript level and production of immunoreactive streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) increased. Exposure of strain MGAS 315 to hydrogen peroxide, an oxidative stressor, induced the prophage encoding mitogenic factor 4 (MF 4), and there was a concomitant increase in the mf 4 transcript. All prophages of strain MGAS 315 that encode virulence factors were induced during culture with mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent. However, the virulence factor gene transcript levels and production of the encoded proteins decreased after mitomycin C treatment. Taken together, the results indicate that a complex relationship exists among environmental culture conditions, prophage induction, and production of prophage-encoded virulence factors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) causes {{invasive}} streptococcal infections, including streptococcal toxic {{shock syndrome}} (STSS), as does Lancefield group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). We sequenced the entire genome of SDSE strain GGS_ 124 isolated {{from a patient}} with STSS. Results We found that GGS_ 124 consisted of a circular genome of 2, 106, 340 bp. Comparative analyses among bacterial genomes indicated that GGS_ 124 was most closely related to GAS. GGS_ 124 and GAS, but not other streptococci, shared a number of virulence factor genes, including genes encoding streptolysin O, NADase, and streptokinase A, distantly related to SIC (DRS), suggesting {{the importance of these}} factors in the development of invasive disease. GGS_ 124 contained 3 prophages, with one containing a virulence factor gene for <b>streptodornase.</b> All 3 prophages were significantly similar to GAS prophages that carry virulence factor genes, indicating that these prophages had transferred these genes between pathogens. SDSE was found to contain a gene encoding a superantigen, streptococcal exotoxin type G, but lacked several genes present in GAS that encode virulence factors, such as other superantigens, cysteine protease speB, and hyaluronan synthase operon hasABC. Similar to GGS_ 124, the SDSE strains contained larger numbers of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) spacers than did GAS, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer via streptococcal phages between SDSE and GAS is somewhat restricted, although they share phage species. Conclusion Genome wide comparisons of SDSE with GAS indicate that SDSE is closely and quantitatively related to GAS. SDSE, however, lacks several virulence factors of GAS, including superantigens, SPE-B and the hasABC operon. CRISPR spacers may limit the horizontal transfer of phage encoded GAS virulence genes into SDSE. These findings may provide clues for dissecting the pathological roles of the virulence factors in SDSE and GAS that cause STSS. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The {{reactivity}} of lymphocytes from patients with either {{carcinoma of the}} breast or large bowel has been studied using the human to mouse normal lympho-cyte transfer (NLT) reaction. It was found that, {{in the case of}} breast cancer, there was a direct correlation between the clinical stage and a reduced NLT reaction. Only patients with regional lymph node or generalized metastases showed signifi-cantly reduced lymphocyte reactivity. However, in the case of large bowel cancer there was a generalized reduction in NLT reactivity which was independent of the clinical stage. Incubation of lymphocytes from individuals without neoplastic disease in serum or plasma from breast cancer patients, showing reduced NLT reactivity, resulted in a reduced NLT reaction. This appears to be indicative of the presence of circulating " blocking factor " in such patients. HUGHES and Mackay (1965) demon-strated a decrease in skin reactivity to tuberculin, in patients with carcinoma of the breast, in whom the disease was no longer localized. Roberts (1974) skin tested breast cancer patients with the antigen Varidase which is a mixture of streptokinase and <b>streptodornase.</b> It was found that reactivity was reduced even in patients with localized disease. This finding was supported by investiga-tions oil lymphocyte reactivity in vitro. Whittaker and Clark (1971) and Watkins (1973) demonstrated diminished lympho-cyte responsiveness to phytohaemagglu-tinin in early breast cancer patients. However, whilst the stage at which immunodepression was first manifest is disputed, all authors agree that it is progressive with advancing disease. A similar situation obtains in carci-noma of the rectum where the skin {{reactivity of}} patients to the antigen 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene is reduced in direct proportion to the clinical stage of the disease (Bone and Camplejohn, 1973). It thus seemed of interest to evaluate further the lymphocyte reacti-vity, in vivo, of patients with these types of malignant neoplasia. To this end the human to mouse normal lymphocyte transfer (NLT) reaction (Rees and Symes, 1973) has been employed...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes {{serotype}} M 1 is {{a frequent}} cause of severe infections in humans. Some M 1 isolates are pathogenic in mice and used in studies on infection pathogenesis. We observed marked differences in murine infections caused by M 1 strain SF 370, 5448, 5448 AP or AP 1 which prompted us to sequence the whole genome of isolates 5448 and AP 1 for comparative analysis. Strain 5448 is known to acquire inactivating mutations in the CovRS two-component system during mouse infection, producing hypervirulent progeny such as 5448 AP. Isolates AP 1 and 5448 AP, more than 5448, caused disseminating infections that became systemic and lethal. SF 370 was not pathogenic. Phages caused gross genetic differences and increased the gene content of AP 1 by 8 % as compared to 5448 and SF 370. Each of six examined M 1 genomes contained two CRISPR-Cas systems. Phage insertion destroyed a type II CRISPR-Cas system in AP 1 and other strains of serotypes M 1, M 3, M 6 and M 24, but not in M 1 strains 5448, SF 370, MGAS 5005, A 20 or M 1 476. A resulting impaired defence against invading genetic elements could {{have led to the}} wealth of phages in AP 1. AP 1 lacks genetic features of the MGAS 5005 -like clonal complex including the <b>streptodornase</b> that drives selection for hypervirulent clones with inactivated CovRS system. Still, inactivating mutations in covS were a common genetic feature of AP 1 and the MGAS 5005 -like isolate 5448 AP. Abolished expression of the cysteine proteinase SpeB, due to CovRS inactivation could be a common cause for hypervirulence of the two isolates. Moreover, an additional protein H-coding gene and a mutation in the regulator gene rofA distinguished AP 1 form other M 1 isolates.

40|$|Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a Gram-positive {{bacterial}} pathogen responsible for life-threatening, invasive human diseases, including necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. In the last 30 years, a global {{increase in the}} rates of severe and fatal forms of GAS infection has been noted. Coinciding with this epidemiological trend has been a pandemic spread of particularly hypervirulent GAS, notably a clone of the M 1 T 1 serotype. Studies investigating this serotype highlight the unique genetic makeup of M 1 T 1 GAS and its interactions with the host innate immune response as key elements coordinating the virulence of this serotype. Phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer and selective pressure exerted by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) for mutations in the control of virulence regulator operon (covRS) bestow M 1 T 1 GAS with enhanced pathogenic capacity. However, isolates of virulent GAS also occur in genetic backgrounds lacking phageencoded factors, such as sda 1, and other M 1 T 1 -specific core genomic elements necessary for covRS mutation. In this study, high-throughput next-generation sequencing was utilised to generate a draft genome sequence of NS 88. 2, an emm 98. 1 GAS isolate exhibiting a hypervirulent and PMN resistant phenotype. The multi-locus sequence type (MLST) was determined from the NS 88. 2 draft genome sequence, which was compared to fully sequenced GAS strains by whole genome BLAST alignment. NS 88. 2 {{was found to have}} a MLST sequence type of 205, and regions of nucleotide sequence divergence between NS 88. 2 and other GAS included the multiple gene regulator (MGA) and fibronectin, collagen and T-antigen (FCT) loci. The NS 88. 2 MGA locus showed low sequence similarity to GAS of other emm-types, and the FCT locus corresponded to an FCT type 3. A ~ 30 kb region containing putative prophagelike elements constituted the majority of NS 88. 2 novel sequence data, however interrogation of these elements did not reveal novel genes with obvious roles in modulating PMN responses. Bioinformatic prediction of genes encoding cell surface and secreted proteins was conducted, and identified 10 putative cell surface proteins and 190 putative proteins with secretion signal peptides. The addition of this genome draft to public databases will facilitate other studies of GAS genome biology, and further in-depth analyses of the NS 88. 2 isolate described here. The phage-encoded extracellular DNase <b>streptodornase</b> 1 (Sda 1) has previously been shown as essential for M 1 T 1 GAS acquisition of covRS mutations. Mutations of covRS in M 1 T 1 GAS bestow hypervirulent and PMN resistant qualities. These phenotypes are also observed in the NS 88. 2 isolate, which encodes a truncated, non-functional covS gene, but not the sda 1 gene. In this study, NS 88. 2 and derivative strains with intact covS (NS 88. 2 rep) or reverse complemented inactive covS (NS 88. 2 covS) were examined to determine potential novel mechanisms by which these strains interact with the innate immune response. Phenotypic comparison of NS 88. 2, NS 88. 2 rep and NS 88. 2 covS to M 1 T 1 GAS demonstrated that similar to M 1 T 1 GAS, mutation of covS impairs the ability of NS 88. 2 and NS 88. 2 covS to adhere to HEp- 2 cells in vitro, murine skin in vivo, and to biofilm production relative to NS 88. 2 rep. The ability of NS 88. 2 strains to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was determined, and in congruence with previously described genome data describing the absence of sda 1, these strains showed significantly reduced ability to degrade NETs over virulent M 1 T 1 GAS. In extension to the NS 88. 2 genomic sequence draft, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches utilising 2 D-PAGE and transcriptional microarray analyses were undertaken. Proteomics revealed that covS-mutation lead to increased amounts of streptococcal collagen-like protein A (SclA), general stress protein 24 (Gls 24) and other known or potential virulence factors in culture supernatants. Analysis of the NS 88. 2 transcriptome demonstrated that sclA was upregulated by covS mutation, and that gls 24 was highly upregulated in response to incubation in whole blood. NS 88. 2 isogenic deletion mutants of sclA and gls 24 exhibited significantly reduced ability to proliferate in whole blood, and reduced ability to resist killing by purified PMNs. This study describes genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterisation of a non-M 1 T 1 GAS isolate, and identification of a novel role for two GAS virulence determinants in modulating interactions with PMNs. Infection of PMNs with M 1 T 1 GAS rapidly triggers an apoptotic cell death program, however the impact of differentially PMN-resistant GAS strains on PMN cell death responses is unclear. In this study, the interactions of PMNs with PMN-resistant (NS 88. 2) and PMN-sensitive (NS 88. 2 rep) GAS were characterised to determine the effect on PMN cell death modality. In vitro infection of purified PMNs demonstrated that PMNs phagocytosed significantly less virulent NS 88. 2 than avirulent NS 88. 2 rep and subsequently generated less reactive oxygen species. PMNs that had phagocytosed NS 88. 2 rep also underwent a higher degree of mitochondrial membrane depolarisation than NS 88. 2. Scanning electron microscopy of NS 88. 2 rep infected PMNs indicated morphological signs of apoptotic cell death, which was supported by biochemical evidence of nuclear DNA fragmentation and caspase- 3 activation. Conversely, apoptotic markers were absent in NS 88. 2 infected PMNs, which displayed ultrastructural markers of oncotic cell death and loss of plasma membrane integrity. Intradermal infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice determined that phagocytosis of NS 88. 2 was impaired in vivo, which contributed to the survival and virulence of this strain. Immunohistological analysis of murine dermal tissue showed that infection by NS 88. 2 rep lead to migration of murine PMNs, and cells associated with infection stained strongly for apoptotic markers associated with a pro-resolution of inflammation phenotype. Murine dermal tissue infected with NS 88. 2 also exhibited murine PMN influx, however was absent for apoptotic markers and exhibited adverse histopathologies. This study indicates that the manner of PMN cell death program induced by GAS infection may enhance GAS virulence and affect disease pathologies. The work described here illustrates interactions between the human innate immune response and GAS in a non-M 1 T 1 genetic background. These findings emphasise heterologous mechanisms by which GAS of different serotypes resist killing by PMNs, and how PMN cell death responses are shaped by virulent and avirulent GAS. A deepened understanding of both host and GAS cellular and molecular interactions during infection holds high potential to identify novel targets that can be exploited for the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for GAS diseases...|$|E
