The {{intention was to}} release a free new song every Friday {{for a few months}} to promote his album, and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label, GOOD Music, and other artists he usually collaborated with. A remix of [...] "Power" [...] was the very first GOOD Friday released, and in an interview with Hot 97, West said that the remix was to feature his good friend and rapper Jay-Z. It was originally intended to be released on August 13, 2010, but was premiered on August 20, 2010 on Hot 97 by Funkmaster Flex. The song also features vocals and production from Swizz Beatz and all new verses provided by West.

This is achieved by twisting the hands and shoulders as the hands are placed on the ground. The two hands are generally placed down one after the other, so that the first hand is twisted by 90 degrees and the second hand by almost 180 degrees from the direction of travel. This creates a handstand position facing the opposite direction the gymnast started in, which they then <b>snap</b> their <b>hips</b> down quickly to create backwards momentum.|$|R

40|$|Background:Coxa saltans {{refers to}} a {{constellation}} of diagnoses that cause <b>snapping</b> of the <b>hip</b> and is {{a major cause of}} anterior hip pain in dancers. When the internal type is accompanied by weakness or pain, it is referred to as iliopsoas syndrome. Iliopsoas syndrome is the result of repetitive active hip flexion in abduction and can be confused with other hip pathology, most commonly of labral etiology. Purpose: To report the incidence, clinical findings, treatment protocol, and results of treatment for iliopsoas syndrome in a population of dancers. Study Design: Retrospective case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective database review of 653 consecutive patients evaluated for musculoskeletal complaints over a 3 -year period was completed. The diagnosis of iliopsoas syndrome was made based on anterior hip or groin pain, weakness with resisted hip flexion in abduction, or symptomatic clicking or snapping with a positive iliopsoas test. Patients identified with iliopsoas syndrome were further stratified according to age at time of onset, insidious versus acute onset, duration of symptoms, side of injury, presence of rest pain, pain with activities of daily living, and associated lower back pain. All patients diagnosed with iliopsoas syndrome underwent physical therapy, including hip flexor stretching and strengthening, pelvic mobilization, and modification of dance technique or exposure as required. Results: A total of 49 dancers were diagnosed and treated for iliopsoas syndrome. Within this injured population of 653 patients...|$|R

40|$|Internal <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} produced by the iliopsoas tendon snapping over the iliopectineal eminence or the femoral head.

40|$|<b>Snapping</b> <b>hip</b> {{syndrome}} is an audible or palpable snap in a hip joint during movement {{which may be}} accompanied by pain or locking. It is typically seen in young athletes performing activities requiring repeated extreme movements of the hip. It may also follow a physical trauma, intramuscular injections or surgeries. There are two main forms of snapping hip: extra- or intra-articular. Extra-articular <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> is elicited by an abnormal movement of specific tendons and {{is divided into two}} forms: internal and external. The internal form of <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> {{syndrome is}} attributed to an abrupt movement of an iliopsoas tendon against an iliopectineal eminence. Radiograph results in patients with this form of snapping tend to be normal. Dynamic ultrasound is the gold standard diagnostic technique in both forms of extra-articular <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> syndrome. The objective of the following text is to describe a step-by-step dynamic ultrasonography examination in internal extra-articular <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> syndrome in accordance to the proposed checklist protocol. To evaluate abrupt movement of an involved tendon, the patient needs to perform specific provocation tests during the examination. With its real-time imaging capabilities, dynamic ultrasonography detects the exact mechanism of the abnormal tendon friction during hip movement in a noninvasive way. It also allows for a diagnosis of additional hip tissue changes which may be causing the pain...|$|E

40|$|The term <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> (coxa saltans) {{refers to}} an au-dible but usually painless snap that is usually {{localized}} to the lateral aspect of the hip and results from sliding of the iliotibial tract over the greater trochanter 4.

Four patients for whom loosening or subluxation of a prosthesis was diagnosed after a total hip replacement were found to have a <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> instead. Operative resection of the fibrotically thickened posterior part of the iliotibial tract, at the insertion of the gluteus maximus, relieved the symptoms in all of the patients. Three patients had a de-creased angle of the femoral neck, and one had an especially prominent greater trochanter.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Snapping</b> <b>hip,</b> or coxa saltans, {{is defined}} as a {{clinical}} condition where a usually painful, audible snap occurs during hip flexion and extension. Its causes can be divided into external, internal or intra-articular origin. Accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite to successful treatment. We report a rare cause of <b>snapping</b> <b>hip</b> which is different from any previously reported cases. Case presentation A 23 -year-old man presented to us with right hip pain of more than 10 years duration. Atrophy of the right gluteus maximus with snapping and tenderness were also noted. The imaging study revealed a focal intramuscular lesion in the lateral portion of the right gluteus maximus muscle.
