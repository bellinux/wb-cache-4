It was noted that the surfactant adsorption was slightly higher 0.96  mg/g at pH value lower than the PZC pH. However, the surfactant adsorption was reduced significantly with the incorporation of the alkalis. Sodium tetraborate had a marked effect by decreasing the surfactant adsorption considerably (0.28  mg/g) onto Berea sandstone as compared to <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate</b> (0.36  mg/g). This pronounced effect may be attributed to the lowering of the ionic strength and high salinity tolerance of sodium tetraborate as compared to <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate.</b> Both alkalis decreased the positive charge of the surface of Berea sandstone due to an increase in the pH. Increasing NaCl concentration also elevated the surfactant adsorption onto Berea sandstone until 2 wt.% concentration.

30|$|The use of alkali {{has proven}} to reduce the {{adsorption}} of anionic surfactants (Hirasaki et al. 2008). Alkali increases the pH and decreases the number of positive sites available for the adsorption on the surface. Sodium carbonate is a conventional alkali used to achieve a low interfacial tension (IFT) by generating in situ surfactants by reacting with acidic compound present in the crude oil. It can also act as a sacrificial agent resulting in the decreased adsorption because it consumes the multivalent cations which would otherwise precipitate with surfactants and cause plugging in rock pores thereby reducing permeability (Grigg et al. 2004; Hirasaki et al. 2008). Another alkali, sodium tetraborate which {{is also known as}} Borax is a novel alkali which can isolate multivalent cations by coordination rather than precipitation. Sodium tetraborate has a high salinity tolerance due to comparatively less ionic strength as compared to <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate</b> (Lv et al. 2011).|$|E

However, the presence of alkali in the flooding systems also caused several problems. Strong alkali such as NaOH and NaSiO 4 could cause permeability reduction and formation damage (Bagci et al. 2000). Scaling formation is another disadvantage of flood using the conventional alkalis, which often leads to the shortening of pump detection period (Krumrine et al. 1985; Cheng et al. 2008). A new alkali, <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate,</b> was reported that no scaling formed, but it could decrease the viscosity of polymer (Flaaten et al. 2010; Hou et al. 2005), and was not a good option for brines with high bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations (Gupta et al. 2009).

Boron removal from liquid silicon by sodium-silicate slags is experimentally studied and it is indicated that B can be rapidly removed within short reaction times. The B removal rate is higher at higher temperatures and higher Na 2 O concentrations in the slag. Based on the experimental results and thermodynamic calculations, it is proposed that B removal from silicon phase takes place through its oxidation at the slag/Si interfacial area by Na 2 O and that the oxidized B is further gasified from the slag through the formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate</b> (Na 2 B 2 O 4) at the slag/gas interfacial area. The overall rate of B removal is mainly controlled by these two chemical reactions. However, it is further proposed that the B removal rate from silicon depends on the mass transport of Na in the system. Sodium is transferred from slag to the molten silicon through the silicothermic reduction of Na 2 O at the slag/Si interface and it simultaneously evaporates at the Si/gas interfacial area. This causes a Na concentration rise in silicon and its further decline after reaching a maximum.

The results obtained in this study indicated that even a higher temperature heating at 400 oC under 10 bar hydrogen pressure was insufficient for magnesium hydride formation. Heating and grinding time were selected as the most effective parameters by which a full-factorial experimental design methodology was implemented.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) over efficient metal catalysts is a promising approach to hydrogen storage. An alkali such as NaOH is often added to stabilise the system in practical applications. The concentration of the NaBH 4 solution should {{be as high as}} possible to improve energy density of the system. However, the byproduct <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate</b> (NaB 02) would become saturated and precipitate from the solution when the concentration of sodium borohydride is over a limit, resulting in piping blockage and the decrease of the catalyst efficiency. The theme of this thesis was to investigate the maximum NaB concentration. Below the maximum concentration, the precipitation of the by-product will not occur, and above the maximum concentration, the by-product tends to precipitate from the solution. Hydrogen generation rate was then investigated up to high concentration. The maximum concentration was studied using a thermodynamic approach. The relationship between the solubility and the temperature was derived based on the equality of the chemical potential of the solute in solution and in its solid state. The solubility data of NaBH 4 and NaB 02 were obtained by analysing the phase diagrams of NaBH 4 -NaOHH 20 and NaB 02 -NaOH-H 20 respectively. The model parameters were then determined by regression of the solubility data and the temperature. Activity coefficients of NaBH 4 and NaB 02 were needed during the regression and these were achieved by hydration analysis of the phase diagrams. The maximum concentration of NaBH 4 was obtained by taking the maximum between the water in saturated NaBH 4 solution and the sum of the water in saturated NaB 02 solution and the water consumed for hydrolysis. The maximum concentration ofNaBH 4 is mainly determined by the solubility of NaB 02. The modelling of the maximum concentration was then validated experimentally. The rate of hydrogen generation from NaBH 4 hydrolysis was then investigated over carbon supported ruthenium catalyst over a wide range of concentrations. The intrinsic hydrolysis rate is zero-order to NaBH 4 concentration, and has a linear relationship with the basicity of the solution (-ln[OH]). The overall kinetics was modelled by building diffusion and heat effect into the intrinsic rate expression. Experimental results agree well with model prediction...|$|E
30|$|Polymer {{flooding}} {{has been}} employed successfully in Daqing Oilfield in China for decades; it {{contributed to the}} oil recovery of more than 10  % of original oil in place (OOIP) after water flooding (Wang et al. 2009). Alkaline–surfactant–polymer (ASP) flooding can effectively reduce oil residual saturation to reduce interfacial tension (IFT) and the mobility ratio between the water phase and oil phase (Clark et al. 1988; Meyers et al. 1992; Vargo et al. 1999). Alkali is added in ASP flooding to decrease the quantity of the surfactant through competitive adsorption with the surfactant and reaction with petroleum acids in crude oil to generate a new surfactant (Pope 2007; Rivas et al. 1997). However, the use of alkali has introduced problems in the injection of the ASP solution These problems include the deposition of alkali scales in the reservoir and bottom hole (Hou et al. 2005; Bataweel and Nasr-El-Din 2011; Jing et al. 2013), difficulty of treating the produced water (Deng et al. 2002), and reduction of the viscosity of the combined ASP slug (Wang et al. 2006; Nasr–El–Din H.A. et al. Nasr-El-Din et al. 1992). Many methods were introduced to solve these problems. Elraies (2012) proposed a new polymeric surfactant and {{conducted a series of}} experiments to evaluate this surfactant in the absence and presence of alkali. Some studies (Maolei and Yunhong 2012; Flaaten et al. 2008; Berger and Lee 2006 replaced strong alkalis with weak alkalis, such as sodium carbonate, <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate,</b> and organic alkaline, to reduce their effect on the viscosity of the ASP slug. Alkali-free SP flooding avoids the drawbacks associated with alkali. Surfactants with concentrations higher than the critical micelle concentration (CMC) can achieve ultra-low IFT. However, such surfactants are expensive. The use of a hydrophilic surfactant mixed with a relatively lipophilic surfactant or a new surfactant was also investigated (Rosen et al. 2005; Aoudia et al. 2006; Cui et al. 2012). However, studies on SP flooding only focused on the screening and evaluation of the polymer and surfactant and their interaction. Reduction in mobility ratio and IFT is influenced by reservoir brine salinity, reservoir temperature, concentration of chemical ingredients and oil components, and others (Gaonkar 1992; Ferdous et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2008; Gong et al. 2009; Cao et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012). Displacement performance is affected by the interaction of the physical properties of the reservoir and those of the fluid. The primary influencing factors must be identified. SP flooding can enhance recovery because of its capability to control viscous fingering and reduce IFT. In formulas involving the capillary number, ultra-low IFT between the binary system and oil drop in a homogenous core yields the lowest residual oil saturation and the highest oil recovery. In a heterogeneous core with high permeability, sweep efficiency has a larger influence on oil recovery than displacement efficiency. Highest oil recovery can be achieved under optimum IFT and not under the lowest IFT of the binary system. However, this concept (Wang et al. 2010) is based on light oil reservoir with high permeability and low temperature. Dagang Oilfield is a reservoir with medium–low permeability characterized by high temperature, significant heterogeneity, and high brine salinity. These rough conditions bring about a significant challenge in SP flooding and demand different IFTs and viscosities of the SP system.|$|E
40|$|Studying {{chemical}} {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR) in a high-temperature/high-salinity (HT/HS) reservoir will help expand {{the application of}} chemical EOR to more challenging environments. Until recently, chemical EOR was not recommended at reservoirs that contain high concentrations of divalent cations without the need to recondition the reservoir by flooding it with less saline/ less hardness brines. This strategy was found ineffective in preparing the reservoir for chemical flooding. Surfactants used for chemical flooding operating in high temperatures tend to precipitate when exposed to high concentrations of divalent cations and will partition to the oil phase at high salinities. In this study amphoteric surfactant was used to replace the traditionally used anionic surfactants. Amphoteric surfactants show higher multivalent cations tolerance with better thermal stability. A modified amphoteric surfactant with lower adsorption properties was evaluated for oil recovery. Organic alkali was used to eliminate the water softening process when preparing the chemical solution and reduce potential scale problems caused by precipitation due to incompatibility between chemical slug containing alkali and formation brine. Using organic alkali helped in minimizing softening required when preparing an alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) solution using seawater. Solution prepared with organic alkali showed the least injectivity decline when compared to traditional alkalis (NaOH and Na 2 CO 3) and <b>sodium</b> <b>metaborate.</b> Adding organic alkali helped further reduce IFT values when added to surfactant solution. Amphoteric surfactant was found to produce low IFT values at low concentrations and can operate at high salinity / high hardness conditions. When mixed with polymer it improved the viscosity of the surfactant-polymer (SP) solution when prepared in high salinity mixing water (6 % NaCl). When prepared in seawater and tested in reservoir temperature (95 ?C) no reduction in viscosity was found. Unlike the anionic surfactant that causes reduction in viscosity of the SP solution at reservoir temperature. This will not require increasing the polymer concentration in the chemical slug. Unlike the case when anionic surfactant was used and more polymer need {{to be added to}} compensate the reduction in viscosity. Berea sandstone cores show lower recovery compared to dolomite cores. It was also found that Berea cores were more sensitive to polymer concentration and type and injectivity decline can be a serious issue during chemical and polymer injection. Dolomite did not show injectivity decline during chemical and polymer flooding and was not sensitive to the polymer concentration when a polymer with low molecular weight was used. CT scan was employed to study the displacement of oil during ASP, SP, polymer and surfactant flooding. The formation and propagation oil bank was observed during these core flood experiments. ASP and SP flooding showed the highest recovery, and formation and propagation of oil bank was clearer in these experiments compared to surfactant flooding. It was found that in Berea sandstone with a permeability range of 50 to 80 md that the recovery and fluid flow was through some dominating and some smaller channels. This explained the deviation from piston-like displacement, where a sharp change in saturation in part of the flood related to the dominated channels and tapered front with late arrival when oil is recovered from the smaller channels. It was concluded that the recovery in the case of sandstone was dominated by the fluid flow and chemical propagation in the porous media not by the effectiveness of the chemical slug to lower the IFT between the displacing fluid and oil...|$|E
