50|$|For {{most people}} with acute cholecystitis, the {{treatment}} of choice is surgical removal of the gallbladder, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using several small incisions located at various points across the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared to open cholecystectomy (using a large incision in the right upper abdomen under the rib cage). People undergoing laparoscopic <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> less incisional pain postoperatively as well as having fewer long term complications and less disability following the surgery.

5000|$|Surgical {{margin in}} a <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> defines the visible margin or free edge of [...] "normal" [...] tissue {{seen by the}} surgeon with the naked eye. Surgical margin as read in a {{pathology}} report defines the histological measurement of normal or unaffected tissue surrounding the visible tumor under a microscope on a glass mounted histology section. [...] A [...] "narrow" [...] surgical margin implies that the tumor exists {{very close to the}} surgical margin, and a [...] "wide" [...] surgical margin implies the tumor exists far from the cut edge or the surgical margin. Narrow surgical margin using the bread loafing technique suggests that residual cancer might be left due to false negative error. A surgeon often will perform a second surgery if a narrow surgical margin is noted on a pathology report.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To answer {{two related}} questions: (1) Do managed care {{organizations}} (MCOs) in New York State (NYS) consider quality when they choose cardiac surgeons? (2) Do they use information about risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR) {{provided in the}} New York State Cardiac <b>Surgery</b> <b>Reports?</b> DATA SOURCES: (1) Telephone interviews with and contracting data from the majority of MCOs licensed in NYS; (2) RAMR, quality outlier designation, and procedure volume for all cardiac surgeons, {{as reported in the}} Cardiac <b>Surgery</b> <b>Reports.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Interview data were analyzed in conjunction with patterns revealed by contracting data. Null hypotheses that MCOs' contracting choices were random with respect to the information published in the Cardiac <b>Surgery</b> <b>Reports</b> were tested. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty percent of MCOs ranked the quality of surgeons as most important in their contracting considerations. Although 64 percent of MCOs indicated some knowledge of the NYS Cardiac <b>Surgery</b> <b>Reports,</b> only 20 percent indicated that the reports were a major factor in their contracting decision. Analyses of actual contracting patterns show that in aggregate, the hypothesis of random choice could be rejected with respect to high-quality outlier status and high procedure volume but not for RAMR or poor-quality outlier status. The panel composition of the majority of MCOs (80. 2 percent) was within two standard deviations of the expected mean under the null hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a professed preference for high-quality surgeons, the use of publicly available quality reports by MCOs is currently low, and contracting practices for the majority of MCOs do not indicate a systematic selection either for or against surgeons based on their reported mortality scores. This study suggests that policy initiatives to increase the effective use of report cards should be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> cards {{have been}} {{credited}} with fostering reductions in patient mortality, {{but there has been}} substantial disagreement over the source of the reduction. This dissertation examines the motivations behind and evidence for potential responses to report cards in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania during 1988 – 2002, using as a quasi-experimental control Florida, a state with active oversight of cardiac services and a history of publishing consumer guides for health services, but without statewide cardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> cards. Hospital discharge data were augmented with surgeon demographic information and report card ratings, and a range of econometric models was estimated to test whether and why report card publication was associated with lower mortality. Relative to Florida, risk-adjusted mortality dropped sharply in New York and New Jersey around the time of initial report card publication, but more gradually in Pennsylvania. Report card publication was associated with an increase in the propensity for low-risk candidates to receive CABG but there was no change for high-risk candidates. Report cards also may have accelerated surgeon exit, particularly for low volume surgeons and those at hospitals with negative ratings. Exit could not account for lower mortality, however; while in the report card states exiting surgeons had higher mortality rates than surgeons continuing to practice, {{the difference between the two}} was no smaller in Florida. The measured effects of report cards on referrals patterns were negligible. In contrast, there was strong evidence that referral patterns were already correlated with surgeon ratings prior to publication. Although other explanations may have played a role, report card publication appears to have reduced mortality most likely by stimulating genuine quality improvement among providers. ...|$|E

40|$|Health care {{report cards}} - public {{disclosure}} of patient health outcomes {{at the level}} of the individual physician and/or hospital - may address important informational asymmetries in markets for health care, but they may also give doctors and hospitals incentives to decline to treat more difficult, severely ill patients. Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity, quality, and appropriateness of medical treatment that they induce. Using national data on Medicare patients at risk for cardiac surgery, we find that cardiac <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> cards in New York and Pennsylvania led both to selection behavior by providers and to improved matching of patients with hospitals. On net, this led to higher levels of resource use and to worse health outcomes, particularly for sicker patients.

Moreover, before surgery, the probability of postoperative de novo dyspareunia should be discussed with the patient.|$|E

40|$|Abstract】Objective: Detection of {{abdominal}} {{injury is}} a very important component in trauma management, so a precise assessment of liver and spleen injuries including their severity degree is necessary. There is a good case to believe that in emergency situations the radiologists’ performance may profit from a systematic approach using established scoring systems. Score systems as the organ injury scale (OIS) drawn up by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma are a valuable guidance for objective trauma assessment. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate retrospectively whether a structured approach using the OIS may help improve trauma assessment. Methods: Fifty-three patients, 38 male and 15 female who underwent CT and laparotomy after abdominal trauma were included in this study. The laparotomy was performed by experienced surgeons with a minimum experience of 6 years. While the original CT reports were written by different radiologists with a minimum experience of 3 years, and then a radiologist with experience of 4 years reviewed the same original CT pictures, resulting in the structured report. Both the original and structured CT results on liver and spleen injuries were transferred into OIS grades. Finally, the initial and structured CT results were compared with the intraoperative findings gathered from the <b>surgery</b> <b>report.</b> Results: Regarding the original CT report we found a mean divergence of 0. 68 ± 0. 8 (r= 0. 45) to the OIS finding in the <b>surgery</b> <b>report</b> for liver injuries (0. 69 ± 1. 17 for spleen injuries; r= 0. 69). In comparison with the structured approach, where we detected a divergence of 0. 8 ± 0. 68; r= 0. 63 (0. 47 ± 0. 77 for spleen injuries; r= 0. 91), there was no significant difference. However we detected a lower rate of over-diagnosis in structured approaches. Conclusion: Our study shows that a structured approach to triage abdominal trauma using an imaging check- list does not lead to a significantly higher detection rate, but a nonsignificant trend to reduce the rate of over-diagnoses, thus being more precise in grading the severity grade. Concerning the bias by retrospective study design, further prospective investigations are needed to evaluate the impact of trauma scores on the workflow in emergency department procedure as structured reporting systems are a valuable guidance in other radiological disciplines...|$|E
