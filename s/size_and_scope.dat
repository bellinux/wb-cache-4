5|$|Mother 2 was {{designed}} to fit within an eight megabit limit, but was expanded in <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told Weekly Famitsu that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game {{and that it was}} the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. Mother 2 would release in North America about a year later.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} paid {{the salaries of}} the governor, legislature, and judicial council, but did not provide funds for any additional governmental offices.

As the population increased, and revenues grew, so did the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the government with new offices being created at different times. The territory's primary source of revenue was from the sale of federal lands; the territory collected 3% of the proceeds of each sale. Property tax and trading ventures with the Native American tribes also provided lesser revenues.|$|E

He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> {{of the occupation}} declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951. He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.|$|E

5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope,</b> he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|The final straw was Henry's {{decision}} {{to give his}} youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November. Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent. Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King William of Scotland and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois—all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won. Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and Angoulême. In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, {{although the majority of}} the duchy remained openly loyal, there {{appears to have been a}} wider undercurrent of discontent. Only Anjou proved relatively secure. Despite the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles in strategic areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that {{because they were not}} worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

The results of a survey conducted in Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) in early 2012 showed that program evaluation was not an established process {{in the majority of}} schools. It was at best a stand-alone project focusing on a single course or a particular component of it with no structured follow-up (2). Hence, we decided to promote and organize course evaluation practices in our university by development of general guidelines. TUMS has eleven affiliated schools of various <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of activities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{vocabulary of concepts}} and a corresponding graphical notation called Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) to describe the conceptual architecture of large and complex software systems. The main objective {{of this approach is}} to improve knowledge exchange, at the architectural level, between the participants of software development projects using a semiformal graphical notation. The focus of FMC is not to represent code structures but rather to describe system concepts and amhitectural rationale. FMC is not bound to a specific programming paradigm and thus enables communication about any type of software systems. We present both a metamodel and a graphical notation suitablefor the intended use. Furthermore, we will summarize our results achieved in applying FMC to software projects of different <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>scopes...</b>|$|R
