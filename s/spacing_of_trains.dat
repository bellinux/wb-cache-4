40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for rail travel in this country which is {{difficult}} to satisfy. The result is increased congestion on Britain’s railways. One feature of rail infrastructure congestion is a direct link between capacity utilisation and reactionary delay. The latter is the secondary delay that an already late train causes to a following train. This thesis re-examines the relationship between capacity utilisation and performance (as expressed by the level of reactionary delay). It compares {{the effectiveness of the}} standard measure of capacity utilisation in Britain (the Capacity Utilisation Index or CUI) with amongst others a measure developed in the Netherlands (the Heterogeneity measure or HET) which uses a radically different approach. The analysis presented in this thesis finds that HET which measures how capacity is used through the <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains,</b> is a more effective predictor of the levels of reactionary delay than CUI which simply measures how much capacity is used. In both cases though, an exponential relationship between capacity utilisation and reactionary delay is preferred, reinforcing the work of previous researchers. In 2002 a congestion charge, called The Capacity Charge, was introduced in Britain. The idea was to encourage the Infrastructure Owner (now known as Network Rail) to accommodate more traffic whilst working with train operators to optimise capacity utilisation on the network. The Capacity Charge is based on the relationship between CUI and reactionary delay. However, this thesis shows that HET based tariffs would charge more for congestion than CUI based tariffs. In addition there is a greater differential between peak and off-peak charges. One conclusion is that CUI undercharges for congestion due to its failure to account for the impact of train ‘bunching’. ...|$|E

The mean discrepancy in the paper is calculated not only by the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> multidimensional observations but also by the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sets <b>of</b> fixed size. It was shown that mean discrepancy may be represented as the sum of three component. The first one is irremovable “noise”, the second component is the mean squared deviation of mean regression function from conditional means of dependent variable in points <b>of</b> independent variables <b>space,</b> the third component is instability term that is the variance of regression functions on the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sets. It was shown that the using of simplest voting procedure by the initial set of regression methods allows to receive new regression model with instability component less than average instability component of the initial set. The large scale experiments with Monte-Carlo simulated data demonstrated that voting procedures really allow to improve regression performance and that the cause of such improvement is the decrease <b>of</b> instability <b>of</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R

In deformable model segmentation, a driving consideration is the geometry to image match, {{the degree to}} which the target image conforms to some template within the object boundary regions. The template should account for variation over a training set and yet be specific enough to drive an optimization to a desirable result. Using clustering, a template can be built that is optimal over the training data in the metric used, such as normalized correlation. We present a method that first determines local crossboundary image profile types in the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data and then builds a template of optimal types.

40|$|Boosting is {{a general}} method {{that can be applied}} on any {{learning}} algorithm to improve its performance. Throughout the evolution of boosting-based algorithms, the term “weak leaner” has always been mentioned. Literally it refers to weak learning algorithms that perform just slightly better than random guess. Schapire R. E. (1990) showed that these so-called weak learners can be efficiently combined or “boosted” to build a strong accurate classifier. This boosting algorithm applies weak learning algorithms multiple times to instance space with different distribution, and finally construct a strong hypothesis from numerous weak hypotheses Freund, Y. et al., (1997) first introduced theoretically the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) method which significantly reduces the error of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers with the condition of that: “better than random guess”. In AdaBoost algorithms, distribution over instance <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> set are adjusted adaptively to the errors of weak hypotheses. This helps to move the weak learner towards the “harder” part <b>of</b> classification <b>space</b> more efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Does the {{productive}} {{use of language}} stem from the manipulation of mental variables (e. g. "noun", "any consonant") ? If linguistic constraints appeal to variables, rather than instances (e. g. "dog", "m"), then they should generalize to any representable novel instance, including instances that fall beyond the phonological <b>space</b> <b>of</b> a language. We test this prediction by investigating a constraint {{on the structure of}} Hebrew roots. Hebrew frequently exhibits geminates (e. g. ss) in its roots, but it strictly constraints their location: geminates are frequent {{at the end of the}} root (e. g. mss), but rare at its beginning (e. g. ssm). Symbolic accounts capture the ban on root-initial geminates as *XXY, where X and Y are variables that stand for any two distinct consonants. If the constraint on root structure appeals to the identity of abstract variables, then speakers should be able to extend it to root geminates with foreign phonemes, including phonemes with foreign feature values. We present findings from three experiments supporting this prediction. These results suggest that a complete account of linguistic processing must incorporate mechanisms for generalization outside the representational <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> items.

Combining {{multiple}} classifiers {{can give}} substantial improvement in prediction performance of learning algorithms {{especially in the}} presence of noninformative features in the data sets. This technique can also be used for estimating class membership probabilities. We propose an ensemble of k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) classifiers for class membership probability estimation {{in the presence of}} non-informative features in the data. This is done in two steps. Firstly, we select classifiers based upon their individual performance from a set of base kNN models, each generated on a bootstrap sample using a random feature set from the feature <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data. Secondly, a step wise selection is used on the selected learners, and those models are added to the ensemble that maximize its predictive performance. We use bench mark data sets with some added non-informative features for the evaluation of our method. Experimental comparison of the proposed method with usual kNN, bagged kNN, random kNN and random forest shows that it leads to high predictive performance in terms of minimum Brier score on most of the data sets.

40|$|Distinct {{forms of}} memory can be {{highlighted}} using different training protocols. In Drosophila olfactory aversive learning, one conditioning session triggers memory formation independently of protein synthesis, while five spaced conditioning sessions {{lead to the}} formation of long-term memory (LTM), a long-lasting memory dependent on de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, one session of odour-sugar association appeared sufficient for the fly to form LTM. We designed and tuned an apparatus that facilitates repeated discriminative conditioning by alternate presentations of two odours, one being associated with sugar, as well as a new paradigm to test sugar responsiveness (SR). Our results show that both SR and short-term memory (STM) scores increase with starvation length before conditioning. The protein dependency of appetitive LTM is independent of the repetition and the <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sessions, on the starvation duration and on the strength of the unconditioned stimulus. In contrast to a recent report, our test measures an abnormal SR of radish mutant flies, which might initiate their STM and LTM phenotypes.
