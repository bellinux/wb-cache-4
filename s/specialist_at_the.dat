40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} likelihood of accounting restatements is associated with Big 4 industry auditor <b>specialists,</b> measured <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> partner level and the audit firm level. We focus on a sample of listed firms in Taiwan, where audit reports must be audited and signed by the two signing auditors {{as well as by}} an audit firm. Extending previous studies, we classify industry specialists into three groups: (a) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> both <b>the</b> individual partner level (i. e., the lead signing auditors) and the firm level; (b) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual partner level but not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> firm level; and (c) auditors that are industry <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> firm level but not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual partner level. The results reveal that clients of signing auditor specialists, either alone or in conjunction with firm-level specialists, are less likely to make accounting restatements relative to those of other auditors. We find no evidence that firm-level auditor specialists alone are associated with a smaller likelihood of accounting restatements. However, a firm-level industry expert does matter where the lead auditor is an expert. The results suggest that differential likelihood of accounting restatements due to Big 4 industry expertise is primarily attributable to the signing partner specialists rather than to auditor <b>specialists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> firm level. We also find that differential restatement likelihood due to signing auditors' expertise is driven by the lead auditor's expertise, rather than by the concurring auditor's expertise...|$|R

2500|$|Bernard Marx – an Alpha-Plus sleep-learning <b>specialist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Bernard is a misfit. He {{is unusually}} short for an Alpha; an alleged {{accident}} with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting {{has left him}} slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of soma. Bernard {{is in love with}} Lenina but he doesn't like her sleeping with other men, even though [...] "everyone belongs to everyone else". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island for his non-conformist behaviour.|$|E
