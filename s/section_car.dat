50|$|Fairmont {{has been}} home to Fairmont Railway Motors, Inc, now part of Harsco Corporation, for a century. The company pioneered {{motorized}} railway <b>section</b> <b>cars,</b> later road-rail technologies as well as track maintenance machinery that revolutionized and mechanized rail track engineering. Its 100th anniversary celebration {{was held in the}} summer of 2009.|$|R
50|$|Motor <b>section</b> <b>cars</b> {{began to}} appear in the very early 1900s, or a few years earlier. They quickly {{replaced}} most of the handcars. Those handcars that were not scrapped during World War I, were probably scrapped during World War II. It is not clear how many handcars survived. They can be found in railroad museums and some are in private hands.|$|R
5000|$|On September 27, 1945 another {{interurban}} segment, the 28-mile Milwaukee-Port Washington line, {{was sold}} to KMCL for $142,000 (a $37,500 down payment, a $2,000 annual payment and a $3,900 annual land rental.) More rolling stock was included: cars 1139, 1140 and 1141, plus duplex trains 1186-1187, 1196-1197 and 1198-1199 plus line-car D-3 (ex D-23), M-1, 202, F250, F251 and F252, and <b>section</b> <b>cars</b> 40638 and 44037.|$|R
50|$|ASSCO {{was founded}} in November 1999, {{after a series of}} {{informal}} meetings, by a group of motor <b>section</b> <b>car</b> owners who were running in South Australia.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Society of <b>Section</b> <b>Car</b> Operators (ASSCO), is an {{accredited}} railway operator {{that seeks}} access to railways for its members. It is a non-profit organisation, registered under the Associations Incorporations Act (SA).|$|E
50|$|The Society also hosted {{what were}} {{believed}} to be amongst the first organised motor <b>section</b> <b>car</b> excursions in the country. These ran between 1994 and 1998, in association with a live band at Eurelia.|$|E
50|$|The first railway {{to agree}} to host an ASSCO meet was NRG Flinders Operating Services Pty Ltd, {{operator}} of the Leigh Creek line, between Port Augusta and Copley. This was the longest run for <b>section</b> <b>cars</b> at the time, some 250 km. The event was run over the June Long Weekend, 2001. This line carried one coal train each way each day, meaning the trip crossed trains both days.|$|R
50|$|Both the NCSR and WCSR {{operated}} large combination grip cars, with an {{open front}} and closed back <b>sections.</b> These <b>cars</b> also could pull trailers.|$|R
50|$|They {{also have}} a {{significant}} used <b>car</b> review <b>section,</b> used <b>car</b> facts and figures resource and used cars for sale, {{both of which are}} regularly cited in the media.|$|R

50|$|Fairmont {{products}} are exported around the world, although the dominant product, railroad speeders, is now {{mainly in the}} hands of railway enthusiasts who operate them for fun, such as the North American Railcar Operators Association and the Australian Society of <b>Section</b> <b>Car</b> Operators, Inc.|$|E
50|$|Other {{heritage}} {{operations have}} included the Lions Club of YP Rail (Wallaroo-Kadina), Limestone Coast Railway (on the Mount Gambier railway line from Mount Gambier railway station), Cobdogla Steam Friends, Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society (Peterborough-Eurelia) and the Australian Society of <b>Section</b> <b>Car</b> Operators, Inc. (accreditation in SA surrendered in 2010).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the speed}} limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) along the urban freeway section and 100 km/h (62 mph) along the {{interurban}} <b>section,</b> <b>car's</b> average top speed is lower due to traffic congestion as it serves as an arterial corridor to access Barcelona by road, and even average top speed may reach 20 km/h (12 mph) during rush hour. Additional restrictions for heavy goods vehicles are applied on the section situated between Montjuïc-Morrot and Rambla de Prim near Sant Adrià de Besòs, whereby weight limits is posted 12 tonnes and all vehicles over 12 meters long are banned from that section.|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, many speeders were {{replaced}} with trucks (usually pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles) using flanged wheels {{that could be}} lowered for on-rail (called road-rail vehicles or hi-rails for highway-railroad). Speeders are collected by hobbyists, who refurbish them for excursions organized by the North American Railcar Operators Association in the U.S. and Canada and the Australian Society of <b>Section</b> <b>Car</b> Operators, Inc. in Australia.|$|E

5000|$|The Wabash Combination Depot, {{now known}} as the Wabash Depot Museum, is an {{historic}} train station located in Moravia, Iowa, United States. It is believed {{to be one of the}} two standard-plan wooden Wabash combination freight and passenger depots that remain in Iowa. Completed in 1903, it served the Wabash Railroad. The Queen Anne style building is an example of the rural combination station plan. The plan combined all railroad services from passengers to freight in one building. [...] The museum features railroad artifacts, an operational model train layout and a restored railroad <b>section</b> <b>car.</b> The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as a part of the Advent & Development of Railroads in Iowa MPS.|$|E

50|$|On a payday morning, when {{construction}} {{was at a}} point between present day Lostant and Tonica, the men assembled to begin the day's work to discover that their Foreman and two crewmen were absent. Soon a <b>section</b> <b>car</b> approached the camp, with the missing crewmen in custody of the Foreman and Paymaster, having bound them as prisoners. The later pair had devised a plan to flee with the payroll, leaving the entire crew at loss, but somehow drew suspicion and were captured in the act. As punishment for their intended deed, and in plain view of all the camp, the two bound men were thrown to the crossties and were beheaded with an axe. The axemen delivered the payroll, took their fair earnings for the period, and fled.|$|E

50|$|The cars {{experienced}} {{a very positive}} public reaction, and so construction continued with {{a new series of}} saloon carriages. These would become the 700, 750 and 780 class cars, with modified window spacings and slightly shorter bodies. These cars had a central aisle with seats either side and toilets in the centre (dividing the smoking and non-smoking <b>sections).</b> <b>Cars</b> 700-715 were exclusively second class, for 56 passengers across 14 bays of four seats; 750-753 were composite first (22) and second (24); and 780-783 were exclusively first class, with two seats {{on one side of the}} aisle and four on the other, for a total capacity of 38 passengers.|$|R
50|$|They were {{fitted with}} the 328cc Excelsior Talisman engine like the older SE328, {{and the four}} speed and reverse type VR gearbox, and were {{available}} as both soft and hardtops. The chassis plate, mounted on the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder, was the printed SE328 type but with 'T60' stamped in the chassis number block along with the chassis number. Chassis numbers run from 1 to approximately 1800. The first 600 cars (approximately) had a bench seat with an umbrella-type pull handbrake and aluminium reinforcement sections in the punt body <b>section.</b> <b>Cars</b> thereafter had steel punt chassis sections, bucket seats and a floor-mounted handbrake lever.|$|R
50|$|The TG was the {{standard}} 'touring' model, while the SD - {{powered by the}} 1496cc engine, now fitted with a large-port cylinder head - satisfied {{the needs of the}} sporting motorist. Also available in this year was the TH, which had the gearbox and rear axle ratios of the 'touring' TG, but the sub-1500cc engine of the SD. The TG and SD models were available until 1929. The TG and (very rare) TH models can be recognised by their taller radiators, with a noticeably deeper top <b>section.</b> <b>Cars</b> from the 1928 and 1929 model years also sported higher-set lamps, in accordance with the fashion of the time.|$|R
