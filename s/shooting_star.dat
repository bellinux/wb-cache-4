5|$|The <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> has received a mixed critical reception and {{has been one of}} the most controversial instalments in the series due to the anti-Semitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put {{together}} two Tintin plays. The first, Tintin in the Indies, appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, Mr Boullock's Disappearance, was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, Le Soir serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, The <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star,</b> followed by publication {{as a single}} volume by Casterman. In keeping with Le Soirs editorial standpoint, The <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.|$|E

They defended the title against the Dudleys and the Basham Brothers on several {{occasions}} before losing the championship to René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki on September 9, due to Kidman leaving London to fight by himself. Kidman's heel turn led to a feud between the two, which culminated at No Mercy where Kidman defeated London with a <b>shooting</b> <b>star</b> press. After the match, London was bleeding from the mouth and being stretchered when Kidman pulled {{him back into the}} ring with the stretcher and delivered another <b>shooting</b> <b>star</b> press to London's injured ribs.

Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star,</b> but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1944, Republic {{received}} {{an order for}} three prototypes of the new XP-84—Model AP-23. Since the design promised superior performance to the Lockheed-built P-80 <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name Thunderjet was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 Thunderbolt while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On 4 January 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 service test YP-84As and 75 production P-84Bs (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B).|$|E
5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E
5|$|After the Pearl Harbor attack, Taylor was {{assigned}} to the 44th Fighter Squadron, and went to the South Pacific at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal.

This brought his total number of career kills to six, making him a flying ace. Officially however, Taylor is still only credited with two aerial victories on December 7, 1941 and one on January 27, 1943. At Guadalcanal, he was injured during an air raid and was sent back to the United States in 1943. In the U.S., he trained pilots in preparation of combat in Europe and was then assigned to the 12th Pursuit Squadron.
