The proposed method enhances bandwidth utilization besides ensuring three layered security to the message. The underlying principle of this method involves decomposition of each image-pixel into two blocks. One block is called Parity Reflecting Block (PRB) whereas other is known as Pixel <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Block</b> (PAB). The information about hidden bit is reflected by parity condition in the Parity Reflecting <b>Block.</b> The Pixel <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Block</b> is used to perform local pixel adjustment {{in order to reduce}} the degradation effect in the cover image produced as a result of alteration in the moderate bit.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> method that is related to {{geometric}} <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> and {{to the concept of}} a terrain Digital Radiometric Model (DRM) as a complement to the terrain digital elevation and surface models. A DRM, in our concept, is a function that for each ground point returns a reflectance value and a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). In a similar way to the terrain geometric reconstruction procedure, given an image block of some terrain area, we split the DRM generation in two phases: radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> and DRM generation. In the paper we concentrate on the radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> step, but we also describe a preliminary DRM generator. In the <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> step, after a radiometric pre-calibraton step, local atmosphere radiative transfer parameters, and ground reflectances and BRDFs at the radiometric tie points are estimated. This radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> is based on atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) models, pre-selected BRDF models and radiometric ground control points. The proposed concept is implemented and applied in an experimental campaign, and the obtained results are presented. The DRM and orthophoto mosaics are generated showing no radiometric differences at the seam lines...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the control issues of the quasi-Z-source derived {{push-pull}} converter with integrated magnetic elements. The proposed converter is intended for applications that require a high gain of the input voltage and galvanic isolation, i. e. power conditioning systems for renewable energy sources, such as variable speed wind turbines with direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generators. Magnitude and frequency of the output voltage of such turbines are variable due to intermittent nature of the wind power. Despite number of advantages converter has complicated dynamic behavior. Simulations showed change of stability margin depending on current operation point of the wind turbine and output load. Closed loop control system should provide fast response and stable operation in the wide range of wind speeds. Simulations showed that the conventional PI-controller with saturation cannot satisfy those requirements. Nonlinear PI-controller was derived by adding <b>adjustment</b> <b>block</b> to the conventional PI-controller. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>block</b> is drastically changing proportional and integral gains of the controller according to sign of the output voltage error.

It takes full advantage of SAR image geometric information, feature information, gray-related information and external auxiliary terrain information for SAR image matching. And then Image Tie Points (ITPs) of <b>Block</b> <b>Adjustment</b> can be achieved automatically. The main parts of extracting ITPs automatically include: First, SAR images were rectified geometrically based on the geometric information and external auxiliary terrain information (existed DEM) before match. Second, ground grid points with a certain interval can be get in the block area and approximate ITPs were acquired based on external auxiliary terrain information. Then match reference point was extracted for homologous image blocks with Harris feature detection operator and ITPs were obtained with pyramid matching based on gray-related information.

40|$|Lunar {{topographic}} {{information is}} essential for lunar scientific investigations and exploration missions. Lunar orbiter imagery and laser altimeter data are two major data sources for lunar topographic modeling. Most previous studies have processed the imagery and laser altimeter data separately for lunar topographic modeling, and there are usually inconsistencies between the derived lunar topographic models. This paper presents a novel combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> approach to integrate multiple strips of the Chinese Chang'E- 2 imagery and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data for precision lunar topographic modeling. The participants of the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> include the orientation parameters of the Chang'E- 2 images, the intra-strip tie points derived from the Chang'E- 2 stereo images of the same orbit, the inter-strip tie points derived from the overlapping area of two neighbor Chang'E- 2 image strips, and the LOLA points. Two constraints are incorporated into the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> including a local surface constraint and an orbit height constraint, which are specifically designed to remedy the large inconsistencies between the Chang'E- 2 and LOLA data sets. The output of the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the improved orientation parameters of the Chang'E- 2 images and ground coordinates of the LOLA points, from which precision lunar topographic models can be generated. The performance of the developed approach was evaluated using the Chang'E- 2 imagery and LOLA data in the Sinus Iridum area and the Apollo 15 landing area. The experimental results revealed that the mean absolute image residuals between the Chang'E- 2 image strips were drastically reduced from tens of pixels before the adjustment to sub-pixel level after adjustment. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with 20 m resolution were generated using the Chang'E- 2 imagery after the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Comparison of the Chang'E- 2 DEM with the LOLA DEM showed a good level of consistency. The developed combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> approach is of significance for the full comparative and synergistic use of lunar topographic data sets from different sensors and different missions.

40|$|The {{satellite}} image with high resolution has been commercially available since early 21 st century, and {{the generation of}} digital elevation model and Ortho-image with lower costs and shorter period from these high-resolution images has become practical. But at first one must calculate the parameters of these high-resolution images. Recently, A new strict geometric model, based on affine transformation, for RSIHR was proposed. In the new model, there are eight affine coefficients and one slantwise angle for each image. However, in order to calculate the nine parameters, more than five control points are needed. Therefore, many control points {{should be used in}} a block for the new model. It is difficult to acquire many control points in a <b>block,</b> and <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> with the new model based few control points is necessary for computing the parameters of every image in the block.

40|$|The paper reviews {{at first}} {{some aspects of}} the {{generalised}} Procrustes analysis (GP) and outlines the analogies with the <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> by independent models. On this basis, an innovative solution of the <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> problem by Procrustes algorithms and the related computer program implementation are presented and discussed. The main advantage of the new proposed method is that it avoids the conventional least squares solution. For this reason, linearisation algorithms and the knowledge of a priori approximate values for the unknown parameters are not required. Once the model coordinates of the tie points are available and at least three control points are known, the Procrustes algorithms can directly provide, without further information, the tie point ground coordinates and the exterior orientation parameters. Furthermore, some numerical <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> solutions obtained by the new method in different areas of North Italy are compared to the conventional solution. The very simple data input process, the less memory requirements, the low computing time and the same level of accuracy that characterise the new algorithm with respect to a conventional one are verified with these tests. A <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> of 11 models, with 44 tie points and 14 control points, takes just a few seconds on an Intel PIII 400 MHz computer, and the total data memory required is less than twice the allocated space for the input data.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the failure of the European Community and subsequently of the European Union to develop a full common air-transport policy. The main issues on which the present study focuses are the reciprocal influences, interactions and confrontations of national and EC air-transport policy interests. It is demonstrated that they obstructed the process of the air-transport market liberalization and inhibited the development of an integrated EC air-transport policy.
