5|$|Stivetts {{was again}} {{reserved}} by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000. Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed that he had never felt better in his life and his outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E
5|$|The Indians {{played in}} the 1948 World Series and were helped by Lemon's two {{pitching}} wins as they won the club's first championship since 1920. In the early 1950s, Cleveland had a <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation which included Lemon, Bob Feller, Mike Garcia and Early Wynn. During the 1954 season, Lemon had a career-best 23–7 win–loss record and the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the American League (AL) pennant. He was an All-Star for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948–1956.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{opened their}} {{season with a}} three-game series in Arlington, Texas against the Rangers. On opening day, {{although}} they took a 6–0 lead (thanks {{in part to a}} grand slam by Jimmy Rollins, his 200th career home run), but Cliff Lee gave up seven runs in the next two innings. The Phillies tied the game in the fourth inning, and over the next several innings Marlon Byrd and Cody Asche homered. Texas scored two more runs, but the Phillies won 14–10. Despite the 14 opening-day runs, Ryne Sandberg changed the lineup for the Phillies' second game (against left-handed Martin Perez) by replacing three left-handed hitters with right-handed hitters (perhaps to maximize the Phillies' platoon advantage). A. J. Burnett started, pitching six innings and giving up one run. The game was scoreless until the sixth inning before the Rangers won, 3–2, on a walk-off single by Adrián Beltré {{in the bottom of the}} ninth. Although Kyle Kendrick allowed one run in seven innings in the series' final game, Jonathan Papelbon gave up three runs in the ninth inning (including a walk-off walk to Shin-Soo Choo) to blow the save. The Phillies lost two of their first three games, despite strong <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> in the last two.|$|E
25|$|The Yankees began {{retooling}} the team, {{when they}} acquired first baseman/outfielder Nick Swisher, along with relief prospect Kanekoa Texeira, from the Chicago White Sox for infielder Wilson Betemit, relief prospect Jhonny Núñez and <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> prospect Jeff Marquez.|$|E
25|$|As of August 27, with Carlos Martinez, 24 (born on Sep. 21), Alex Reyes, 21 (born on Aug. 29), and Luke Weaver, 23, (born on Aug. 21) {{all in the}} rotation, the Cardinals {{have three}} of the most {{exciting}} young <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> talents in baseball.|$|E

25|$|The Astros also {{announced}} their <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation. As usual Roy Oswalt {{was given the}} ball on opening day.

25|$|For the 2011 season, Halladay {{was joined}} by Cliff Lee, who before the 2010 season had been traded away from the Phillies shortly before Halladay joined. The {{resulting}} <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> lineup of Halladay, Lee, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt and Joe Blanton had commentators dub {{it one of the}} best rotations ever assembled.

25|$|When {{the series}} {{shifted to the}} Motor City, the Tigers took command. In Game 3, a two-out rally {{in the second inning}} led to four runs and the yanking of Padre starter Tim Lollar after one and two-thirds innings. The Padres, plagued by poor <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> {{throughout}} the series, never recovered and lost 5–2. Eric Show continued the parade of bad outings in Game 4, getting bounced after two and two-thirds innings after giving up home runs to Series MVP Trammell in his first two at-bats. Trammell's homers held up with the help of another Morris complete game, and the Tigers held a commanding lead.|$|E
25|$|The Cubs {{rebuilt the}} <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> staff {{through a series}} of trades by Dallas Green after a disappointing 1983 season where they went 71-91. Green had been brought to the Cubs by the Tribune company which {{purchased}} the team in 1981. Before the season started, Green dealt Carmelo Martínez, Craig Lefferts, and Fritzie Connally to acquire right-hander Scott Sanderson. On May 25, the Cubs traded Bill Buckner to the Boston Red Sox for righty Dennis Eckersley and Mike Brumley. Finally on June 13, Mel Hall, Joe Carter, Don Schulze, and Darryl Banks were sent to the Cleveland Indians for starter Rick Sutcliffe, George Frazier, and Ron Hassey. The acquisition of these three starters solidified the rotation for the year.|$|E
25|$|The Mariners {{began the}} 2005–2006 {{off-season}} by signing star Japanese catcher Kenji Johjima to a 3-year deal and left-handed starter Jarrod Washburn (formerly of division rival Los Angeles) to a 4-year deal. Designated hitter Carl Everett and outfielder Matt Lawton also joined the team, although both would finish the season out of baseball. The Mariners entered the All-Star Break 2.5 games out of {{first place in}} the AL West with a 43–46 record. Despite remaining in contention within the AL West through July, a disastrous 0–11 road trip in mid-August signaled the end of the Mariners' playoff hopes, leaving them in last place, where they would finish the season. Pitcher Jamie Moyer was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for a pair of minor league prospects, and weeks later bench coach Ron Hassey and administrative coach Dan Rohn—whom many viewed as a prime candidate to replace Hargrove as manager—were removed from their positions with the team. At season's end, the Mariners had only narrowly avoided losing 90 games for the third consecutive year. While the team entered the 2006–2007 off-season with some young talent in key positions, many questions remained as to the consistency of their offense and, more importantly, the strength of their <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> staff.|$|E
50|$|On June 30, 2012, Perez {{made his}} first major league <b>start,</b> <b>pitching</b> 5 and a third innings and {{striking}} out five while only giving up two runs in a 7-2 win over the Oakland A's.|$|R

25|$|In 2012, the Braves {{began their}} 138th season after an {{upsetting}} {{end to the}} 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman Chipper Jones would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher Derek Lowe, shortstop Alex González, and outfielder Nate McLouth. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder Michael Bourn, along with shortstops Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to Brandon Beachy), manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher Kris Medlen to the <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation. The Braves {{went on to win}} every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the Washington Nationals in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series.|$|E
25|$|Toronto {{opened a}} 10-game homestand against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on May 18. Roberto Osuna earned his first career {{win in the}} Blue Jays 10–6 victory. The Blue Jays would get strong <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> but lose the next two games in the series, each by a single run. In the final game, R.A. Dickey pitched his first {{complete}} game victory at home as a Blue Jay, winning 8–4. The Seattle Mariners then came to Toronto for a 3-game set. The Blue Jays pitching continued to improve, but their offence was shut down by Felix Hernandez and James Paxton {{in the first two}} games, losing 4–3 and 3–2. Toronto would win the final game of the series, 8–2, aided by another strong pitching performance by Aaron Sanchez. Closing the homestand, the Blue Jays took on the Chicago White Sox. Drew Hutchison pitched his second career complete game shutout in {{the first game of the}} series, winning 6–0. In the second game, the Blue Jays received excellent offensive performances from Jose Bautista and Josh Donaldson, winning 10–9. Bautista had 3 doubles and 5 RBI, while Donaldson went 4–4 with 5 runs scored and two home runs, one of which was a walk-off, 3-run home run. The Jays would lose the finale of the series 5–3 in the tenth inning. Josh Donaldson hit a ninth inning home run to tie the game and send it to extras, bringing him to three straight games with at least one home run.|$|E
25|$|The Jays {{returned}} {{home after a}} 3–3 road trip {{to take on the}} Houston Astros {{for the first time since}} suffering a four-game sweep against them in May. In the first game, Aaron Sanchez established a new career high with 8 innings pitched and did not walk a batter for the first time as a starter. The Blue Jays won the game by a score of 6–2. Aided by another strong <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> performance from Drew Hutchison, the Blue Jays earned their first four-game winning streak of 2015 by beating the Astros 7–2 in the second game of the series. In the final game of the series, Chris Colabello extended his hitting streak to 17 games in the bottom of the ninth inning, when he singled and drove in Jose Reyes and Jose Bautista to give the Blue Jays a walk-off victory, 7–6, and their second sweep of the season. The Miami Marlins made their first trip to Toronto since the 2012 trade between the two clubs that exchanged 12 players. In the first game, the Blue Jays knocked Marlins' starter Brad Hand out in the first inning, en route to an 11–3 win. In the second game of the series, Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run walk-off home run to extend the Blue Jays' winning streak to 7 games. Chris Colabello failed to record a hit, ending his 18-game hitting streak. Toronto would complete the sweep on June 10, aided by 4 home runs, and capped a 6–0 homestand by winning 7–2. Scott Copeland made his first major league start and took the win, pitching 7 innings and yielding only 1 run.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine if different strategies used to practice sightsing-ing would aid nonmusic students in accurately performing such a task; if improvement in sightsinging would transfer to improved pitch accuracy while singing a familiar children's song; and if teacher-selected <b>starting</b> <b>pitches</b> and tessituras would raise the tessitura of sub-sequent performances by subjects. Pretest and posttest data compared among the five groups of elementary education majors (N = 91) the accuracy of notes and intervals sung and sub-ject-selected <b>starting</b> <b>pitches</b> on a familiar children's song and four composed sightsinging exercises. Results indicated that improvement in sightsinging occurred in all experimental groups, with posttest scores of subjects using solfge coupled with Curwen hand signs and those using solfege alone scoring significantly better (p 5) on the accuracy of singing a familiar song on the posttest, with an average gain of 6. 4 %, indicating that improvement of vocal accuracy while sightsinging did not transfer into recreational singing. Classwork in a higher tessitura than that selected by all subjects on the pretest had no effect on shifting <b>starting</b> <b>pitches</b> upward during the singing of afamiliar song on the posttest...|$|R

After one season, he joined the U.S. Army and served for three years. Following his military discharge, Garcia returned to baseball. He was promoted to the MLB in 1948. He played 12 of his 14 major league seasons for the Cleveland Indians. From 1949 to 1954, Garcia joined Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, and Bob Feller on the Indians' [...] "Big Four" [...] pitching staff. Historians consider the [...] "Big Four" [...] {{to be one of the}} greatest <b>starting</b> <b>pitching</b> rotations in baseball history.

500|$|Feller {{joined the}} Indians {{and made his}} Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief {{appearance}} against the Washington Senators. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the St. Louis Browns. Indians manager Steve O'Neill had Denny Galehouse warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 strikeouts in earning his first career win. His strikeout total was the highest for a (<b>starting)</b> <b>pitching</b> debut. Two weeks later, he struck out 17 batters, tying a single-game strikeout record previously set by Dizzy Dean, in a win over the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished {{the season with a}} 5–3 record, having appeared in 14 games; he had 47 walks and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings. Feller's fame reached such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him.
