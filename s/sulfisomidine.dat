40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the influences of sulfonamides on the function of pseudoeosinophils of the rabbit bone-marrow, the bone marrow tissue culture (cover-slip method) was conducted. Sulfonamides {{were added to the}} tissue culture medium at various concentrations, the effects of these drugs on the wandering velocity and carbon-particle phagocytosis of pseudoeosinophils were observed; and the following results were obtained. 1. Sulfonamides such as sulfanilamide, sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, <b>sulfisomidine</b> and carbutamide, at the concentration equivalent to the therapeutic blood level (1 - 20 mg/dl), slightly suppressed the wandering velocity and carbon-particle phagocytosis of pseudoeosinophils. 2. These sulfonamides showed a greater inhibitory action on the wandering velocity and carbon-particle phagocytosis of pseudoeosinophils at the concentration of more than 20 mg/dl...|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the influences of sulfonamides on the erythropoietic function of bone marrow, the cell suspension culture of the rabbit bone marrow was conducted. Sulfonamides were added previously to the fluid medium of the bone-marrow tissue culture at various concentrations, {{and the effects of}} these drugs on the increasing rate of hemoglobin, erythrocytes and reticulocytes were studied; and the following results were obtained. 1. Sulfonamides such as sulfanilamide, sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, <b>sulfisomidine</b> and carbutamide, at the concentration equivalent to the therapeutic blood level (1 - 20 mg/dl), exerted a slight inhibitory action on the increasing rate of erythrocytes and reticulocytes but almost no effect on the increase of hemoglobin. 2.

40|$|The {{majority}} (85 %) of shigella {{isolated in}} 1980 and 1981 in Korea were Shigella flexneri, {{the others were}} Sh. sonnei (14 %) with {{only a small number}} of Sh. dysenteriae. Only 14 of the 459 strains of shigella isolated were susceptible to all 12 drugs tested, and 445 were resistant to three or more drugs. Strains multiply resistant to the six drugs, chloramphenicol (Cm), tetracycline (Tc), streptomycin (Sm), <b>sulfisomidine</b> (Su), ampicillin (Ap) and trimethoprim (Tp) were most frequently encountered, followed by those resistant to Cm, Tc, Sm, Su and Tp. The complete patterns of resistance to drugs except nalidixic acid and rifampin in approximately 73 % of drug-resistant strains were co-transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation, indicating that the resistance was R plasmid-mediated. Randomly selected R plasmids conferring various patterns of resistance markers were tested for the incompatibility groups, and almost all of them were classified into Inc FII. Two of three R plasmids conferring resistance to Cm, Tc, Sm and Su were classified into Inc B and one to Inc FII. Two R types with resistance markers of Cm, Tc, Sm and Ap were not classified with our standard plasmids used...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 949 strains of Salmonella typhi {{isolated}} in Korea from 1968 to 1975 were tested for drug resistance {{and distribution of}} R plasmids. Resistance was mostly restricted to streptomycin (SM) and <b>sulfisomidine</b> (SA), singly or in combination, at a low degree. A small number of strains (1. 5 %) were resistant to four or more drugs: chloramphenicol (CM), tetracycline (TC), SM, SA, ampicillin (AP), and kanamycin (KM). No strain was resistant to nalidixic acid or to a 1 : 20 mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Nor was there any strain singly resistant to CM, TC, AP, or KM. Transfer experiments of multiple-drug resistance to Escherichia coli ML 1410 showed that all the strains resistant to four or more drugs carried R plasmids, whereas those weakly resistant to three or less drugs did not. The quadruply resistant strains carried one R plasmid determining CM, TC, SM, and SA resistance, and sextuply resistant ones carried two plasmids, one determining CM, TC, SM, and SA resistance and the other determining AP and KM resistance. One strain carrying a plasmid determining AP and KM resistance was also found. The transfer frequency of CM, TC, SM, and SA resistance was much {{higher than that of}} AP and KM resistance. The resistance of S. typhi was more efficiently transferred to E. coli at 25 °C than at 37 °C...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of 22 sulfonamides in pork, including sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfamera-zinesulfadoxine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamoxole, sulfaphenazole, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim and <b>sulfisomidine,</b> with matrix solid phase dispersion and high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %. The limits of quantitation were 5 ~ 10 μg/kg. Conclusion The advantages of this method are fast, efficient, less organic reagent and low cost. It is suitable for the determination of sulfonamides residues in pork...|$|E
40|$|In this study, two new, {{sensitive}} and selective LC {{methods have been}} developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of several sulfonamides, {{in the presence of}} putrescine as internal standard, after precolumn derivatization with fluorescamine. In the first method, the derivatives of eight sulfonamides (sulfaguinidine, sulfanilamide, <b>sulfisomidine,</b> sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfamethoxazole) were separated on a reversed-phase column, Inertsil ODS- 3 (250 x 4 mm I. D., 5 μm) using a 20 min gradient elution with a binary system of methanol– 0. 05 mol L- 1 acetate buffer (pH 3. 4) and fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 406 and 496 nm respectively. Fluorescamine was chosen as the derivatization reagent. The following conditions that influence the pre-column derivatization of sulfonamides, such as: reaction medium pH-value, fluorescamine concentration and reaction time were examined by varying one parameter at a time, while keeping the others constant. Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 1. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The within- and between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 4 % and 1. 0 to 3. 8 % respectively. The method was applied to the determination of sulfonamides in human serum and urine and in poultry muscle and eggs, after solid-phase extraction and subsequent derivatization of the extracts. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for the determination of sulfonamides in foods of animal origin. The detection limits varied from 0. 25 to 0. 30 μg L- 1 in serum, 0. 10 to 0. 25 μg L- 1 in urine samples, 1. 0 το 8. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle and 1. 0 to 5. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg samples and were much lower than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). In the second method, the derivatives of twelve sulfonamides (sulfaguinidine, sulfanilamide, <b>sulfisomidine,</b> sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) were separated on a monolithic silica column, Chromolith Performance RP- 18 (100 x 4. 6 mm) using the same binary system (methanol- 0. 05 mol L- 1 acetate buffer pH 3. 4) as above, but with different gradient elution programme. In order to maximize the reaction yield and the sensitivity of the method, the critical derivatization parameters (medium pH, fluorescamine concentration and reaction time) were studied using the univariate approach and optimized. Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 3. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The withinand between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 6 to 3. 2 % and 0. 9 to 3. 3 % respectively. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated, according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, for the determination of sulfonamides in poultry muscle and eggs following solid-phase extraction. The method was also applied in human serum and urine. The detection limits varied from 2. 0 to 17. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle, 2. 0 to 15. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg, 0. 30 to 5. 0 μg L- 1 in human serum and 0. 25 to 2. 5 μg L- 1 in urine samples. In terms of sensitivity, the conventional column, Inertsil ODS- 3, offers lower detection limits for all sulfonamides. On the other hand, correlation coefficients are higher with the monolithic column, indicating better linearity. Seperation efficiency is also superior with the monolithic column, which enables analytical runs under lower back pressure at shorter time. Both analytical procedures were new, fast, simple, selective and highly sensitive. Additionally, the combined use of a monolithic column with fluorescence detection in order to determine sulfonamides by pre-column derivatization with fluorescamine, in human biological fluids, poultry muscle and egg samples, was applied {{here for the first time}} in the literature. ...|$|E
