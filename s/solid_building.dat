A dedicated building was constructed from 1904 to 1912 at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, Iosif Hatzidakis and Stefanos Xanthoudidis. After three destructive earthquakes in 1926, 1930, and 1935, the museum nearly collapsed. The director of the Heraklion Museum was then Spyridon Marinatos, who made great efforts to find funds and persuade the locals and the central government alike that a new <b>solid</b> <b>building</b> was needed. In 1935, Marinatos succeeded in engaging Patroklos Karantinos to build a sturdy structure that has withstood both natural disasters and the bombing that accompanied the German invasion in 1941. Although the museum was damaged during World War II, the collection survived intact and again became accessible {{to the public in}} 1952. A new wing was added in 1964.|$|E
500|$|The Ritz {{became popular}} with film stars and {{executives}} when staying in London, although the hotel has kept {{most of the}} names of many of its luminaries a secret in its records. Douglas Fairbanks was known though to frequent the Ritz in the 1920s, and director Alexander Korda's talent scout held a table at the Ritz in the 1930s. Noël Coward, also a regular diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s, met with Michael Arlen in the restaurant in 1924 to discuss the urgent problem of generating the funding for his new play, The Vortex. Arlen gave Coward a cheque for $250 without question, and The Vortex would go on to be his first major success. Coward's song, [...] "Children of the Ritz", which featured in the 1932 revue Words and Music was penned while Coward was lunching in the Ritz with Beverley Nichols. Numerous authors began to meet at the Ritz during the same period, and it began to creep into literature itself. In Michael Arlen's 1922 novel Piracy, the hotel was described as a [...] "very stout and <b>solid</b> <b>building</b> in the manner of the old Bastille, originally conceived no doubt with a fearful eye on class prejudice", and R. Firbank had a running gag in his novels about there being [...] "fleas in the Ritz". Later, the hotel appears in Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time. The narrator Nicholas Jenkins meets poet Mark Members at the Ritz, and the golden nymph in the Palm Court of the hotel is mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|Ewan Christian {{has rarely}} been {{regarded}} as a great genius in the architectural world and his work has been much criticised since his death as being generally dull and lifeless and that it often lacks elegance and grace. The Pevsner Architectural Guides of The Buildings of England series contain some particularly severe criticisms {{of many of his}} works, especially his church restorations, as at St Peter's in Shelford, Nottinghamshire, where the entry refers to a ruthless restoration by [...] "the callous Mr Christian" [...] while that for St Mary's, Aldingbourne in West Sussex refers to Christian's [...] "horrible restoration" [...] of 1867 leaving the exterior [...] "maimed and valueless" [...] and claimed his work on the windows to have been carried out [...] "with real hatred" [...] – a rather provocative and questionable statement. Even during his lifetime some thought his buildings to be uninspired and his church restorations insensitive – on this subject William Morris (1834–96) once wrote that Christian was [...] "a great criminal" [...] in relation to his supervision of work at St Andrew's Church, Deopham in Norfolk. Such comments have seriously and unfairly tarnished the architect's professional reputation over the years and cast doubts about his abilities as a designer. Modern architectural historians have thought Christian to be [...] "normally pedestrian in his output" [...] and have stated that [...] "little of his immense output shows imagination" [...] Christian was at least regarded as a safe pair of hands for any commission committed to him and was always seen to be reliable, competent and conscientious in his work. He was renowned for the solidity of his constructions and hated shoddy workmanship and 'sham' frontages. His concern for <b>solid</b> <b>building</b> was also an influence on his assessments for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as shown when he annoyed William Butterfield (1814–1900) by insisting that the architect thicken the walls in his design of St John's Church (1876) at Clevedon, Somerset. It should be remembered that Christian was a very prolific architect and that there would naturally be some pedestrian works among such a huge output, as there were with other prolific architects of the Victorian Period, including the most eminent and highly acclaimed of them such as William Butterfield, George Edmund Street and Sir George Gilbert Scott. Also, his buildings and restorations for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had to stay within very strict budgets and this did not permit much elaboration in his designs. Christian's employers no doubt expected him to carry out his restorations to a set standard which would include the removal of old box pews and galleries and the providing of new seating and furnishings, as in the architect's work at Christ Church, Spitalfields. He scrupulously kept within his employers' budget and was always concerned to meet the client's needs and requirements for a commission, as is clearly shown in his work for W. H. Alexander on the National Portrait Gallery, London. Christian was more than capable of producing outstanding architecture when the commission and the funding allowed him the opportunity, as at St Mark's Church in Leicester and at St Matthew's in Cheltenham and as his own house in Hampstead, London proves. Even his first church, St John the Evangelist in Hildenborough, Kent, clearly displays this quality as the historian John Julius Norwich emphasised when he urged avid devotees of churches designed by the more famous Victorian architects [...] "to take a long, close look at this extraordinary building" [...] which he thought in its open interior plan to be [...] "astonishing for the 1840s". He calls Ewan Christian [...] "a revolutionary with a touch of genius".|$|E

And, for the full honesty and straight-forwardness of the work, it is necessary that these string courses and binding plinths should not be of such proportions as would fit them for taking any important part in the hard work of the inner structure, or render them liable to be mistaken for the great cornices and plinths already explained as essential parts of the best <b>solid</b> <b>building.</b> They must be delicate, slight, and visibly incapable of severer work than that assigned to them.|$|E

60|$|When {{the waves}} hit the rock {{they were so}} near that the {{lighthouse}} appeared to receive the shock. Rushing round it on either side, the cleft billows met again to leeward, just opposite the door, where they burst upwards in a magnificent cloud of spray to a height of full thirty feet. At one time, while Ruby held on by the man-ropes {{at the door and}} looked over the edge, he could see a dark abyss with the foam shimmering pale far below; another instant, and the <b>solid</b> <b>building</b> perceptibly trembled, as a green sea hit it fair on the weather-side. A continuous roar and hiss followed as the billow swept round, filled up the dark abyss, and sent the white water gleaming up almost into the doorway. At the same moment the sprays flew by {{on either side of the}} column, so high that a few drops were thrown on the lantern. To Ruby's eye these sprays appeared to be clouds driving across the sky, so high were they above his head. A feeling of awe crept over him as his mind gradually began to realise the world of water which, as it were, overwhelmed him--water and foam roaring and flying everywhere--the heavy seas thundering on the column at his back--the sprays from behind arching almost over the lighthouse, and meeting those that burst up in front, while an eddy of wind sent a cloud swirling in at the doorway, and drenched him to the skin! It was an exhibition of the might of God in the storm such as he had never seen before, and a brief sudden exclamation of thanksgiving burst from the youth's lips, as he thought of how hopeless his case would have been had the French vessel passed the lighthouse an hour later than it did.|$|E
6000|$|His {{classification}} of human employments was rather crude, and, like {{the categories of}} more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these advanced times.

[...] He {{had nothing to say}} against the last four; but he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than his own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such close contact with [...] "business" [...] as to get often honorably decorated with marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of the woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other than an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the subject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of undertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was no spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to him that he was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best land-drainage, <b>solid</b> <b>building,</b> correct measuring, and judicious boring (for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined to give up all forms of his beloved [...] "business" [...] which required that talent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he could do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them, because he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined to charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and [...] "lived in a small way." [...] However, they did not mind it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so,' {{said the}} professor, 'we {{see that this}} Radium, which seemed at first a fantastic exception, a mad {{inversion}} of all that was most established and fundamental in the constitution of matter, is really at one {{with the rest of}} the elements. It does noticeably and forcibly what probably all the other elements are doing with an imperceptible slowness. It is like the single voice crying aloud that betrays the silent breathing multitude in the darkness. Radium is an element that is breaking up and flying to pieces. But perhaps all elements are doing that at less perceptible rates. Uranium certainly is; thorium--the stuff of this incandescent gas mantle--certainly is; actinium. I feel that we are but beginning the list. And we know now that the atom, that once we thought hard and impenetrable, and indivisible and final and--lifeless--lifeless, is really a reservoir of immense energy. That is the most wonderful thing about all this work. A little while ago we thought of the atoms as we thought of bricks, as <b>solid</b> <b>building</b> material, as substantial matter, as unit masses of lifeless stuff, and behold! these bricks are boxes, treasure boxes, boxes full of the intensest force. This little bottle contains about a pint of uranium oxide; that is to say, about fourteen ounces of the element uranium. It is worth about a pound. And in this bottle, ladies and gentlemen, in the atoms in this bottle there slumbers at least as much energy as we could get by burning a hundred and sixty tons of coal. If at a word, in one instant I could suddenly release that energy here and now it would blow us and everything about us to fragments; if I could turn it into the machinery that lights this city, it could keep Edinburgh brightly lit for a week. But at present no man knows, no man has an inkling of how this little lump of stuff can be made to hasten the release of its store. It does release it, as a burn trickles. Slowly the uranium changes into radium, the radium changes into a gas called the radium emanation, and that again to what we call radium A, and so the process goes on, giving out energy at every stage, until at last we reach the last stage of all, which is, so far as we can tell at present, lead. But we cannot hasten it.' ...|$|E
