The Congo basin {{used to be}} covered by rainforest, yet an {{expansion}} of savannah in Central Africa has extending the sandy soil area because of deforestation. The generation of oxygen by forest are contributors to the rainfall system. However, deforestation has disrupted the ecosystem services and created an eco-climate issue. The rainfall pattern in this area has been characterized as a heavy rain season and a severe dry season. The missing forest has intensified the already dichotomy climate, increasing the episodes of violent rainfall and extending the dry season. With long dry spells, the vegetation in these areas can become sparse. This results in no <b>soil</b> <b>protection</b> {{during the rainy season}} and creates more soil erosion problems.|$|E

The indicator of the water quality was structured based on the analysis of water samples collected in eight sampling points along Jiquiriçá river and determined by seven parameters. The indicator of <b>soil’s</b> <b>protection</b> was based on the analysis of maps obtained according to the weight of each steepness and land use class. Results indicate that the watershed is in a poor equilibrium condition and suggest the need for structural investments as well as changes in public polices.

40|$|Abstract:- The use {{of plants}} for <b>soil</b> erosion <b>protection</b> and slope {{stabilization}} {{has a long}} tradition. Old methods with rocks and plants, structures of timber have been used over the past centuries. Recently these old soil conservation and stabilization techniques have been rediscovered and improved. Biotechnical engineering methods {{have become part of}} geotechnical and hydraulic engineering and have helped bridge the gap between classical engineering disciplines, land use management, landscape architecture and biological sciences. In this review the different uses of plants in hydraulic and geotechnical engineering design are presented. The core of this review is a comprehensive overview of the most important biotechnical construction methods used for <b>soil</b> erosion <b>protection</b> and slope stabilization. Methods, construction procedure, and the major advantages and disadvantages of these biotechnical methods are discussed. Considerations about construction and maintenance costs conclude in this review...|$|R

50|$|CCS is a green {{solution}} that makes civil infrastructure projects more sustainable.

When used for slope applications, perforated CCS provides excellent <b>soil</b> <b>protection,</b> water drainage and growth stratum for plants. The long-term design life of advanced CCS technology means that maintenance and the associated environmental costs are significantly reduced, as are long-term economic costs.|$|E
