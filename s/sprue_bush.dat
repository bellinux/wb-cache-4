An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, Ejector plate and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core pins and six ejector pins are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core pins, ejector pins, locator ring and the <b>sprue</b> <b>bush</b> and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. Submarine gate and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|E

However, the merit of plastic products will disappear if cooling not enough. Generally speaking, cooling channel is consisted of straight-line cooling channel or cooling channel combination in a mold. This way has a demerit, which is freedom low, and caused uneven temperature distribution on the product surfaces. To resolve this problem, we proposed the block laminated method. This way is use laminated block to create a space with a particular shape in the mold. Block laminated method have some merits, for example, Cooling channel has a high freedom and easy to obtain a uniformity cooling. However, the core block will deform with the cooling channel increase and mold wall decrease, which cause the product defects. At present, for this way there is a problem, which {{is that there is}} not a proper method to evaluate surface temperature of product, deformation of mold, and design the cooling channel. So, our research objective is define an evaluation function, discuss the surface temperature distribution, mold deformation and automatic generate cooling channel. 樹脂製品は高精度･低コスト･生産性が高いため、工業製品の様々なところに使用されている．しかしながら、成形品表面の温度分布不均一と金型表面の変形が大きい場合は樹脂製品の利点を損なう恐れがある．そこで、成形品表面の均一な温度分布と金型表面の変形を少なくするために、適切な冷却構造を設計する必要がある．一般的に、金型の冷却構造は直線冷却管或いは直線冷却管を組み合わせた構造となっています．しかし、この冷却方法では温度分布の均一化に限界があり、さらに加工時間やコストの増加、複雑な金型の実現困難などの欠点がある．その問題を解決するために、ブロック積層方式が提案されている．ブロック積層方式には次の利点がある．冷却構造の自由度が高い、成形品に沿った冷却構造を持たせることで均一な冷却の実現が可能となり、強度を考慮した構造部設計ができる．しかし、理想的な冷却構造の設計手法がまだ確立されていない．本研究では、評価関数を定義し、成形品表面の温度分布とコアブロックの変形を検討し、冷却管の自動生成することを研究目標としている．九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:情工博甲第 239 号 学位授与年月日:平成 22 年 3 月 24 日 1. 0 Introduction| 2. 0 Literature Review| 3. 0 The Design Process of Cooling Channel by Genetic Algorithms Based On Evaluation Function| 4. 0 Case Studies via Numerical Analysis| 5. 0 <b>Sprue</b> <b>Bush</b> Cooling Channel Design by using Proposed Method| 6. 0 Verification Experiment| 7. 0 Conclusions|References九州工業大学平成 21 年...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{injection}} mould polymers, designing mould {{is a key}} task involving several critical decisions with direct implications to yield quality, productivity and frugality. One prominent decision among them is specifying sprue-bush conduit expansion as it significantly influences overall {{injection mould}}ing; abstruseness anguish in its design criteria deceives direct determination. Intuitively designers decide it wisely and then exasperate by optimising or manipulating processing parameters. To overwhelm that anomaly this research aims at proposing an ideal design criteria holistically for all polymeric materials also tend as a functional assessment metric towards perfection i. e., criteria to specify sprue conduit size before mould development. Accordingly, a priori analytical criterion was deduced quantitatively as expansion ratio from ubiquitous empirical relationships specifically a. k. a an exclusive expansion angle imperatively configured for injectant properties. Its computational intelligence advantage was leveraged to augment functionality of perfectly injecting into an impression gap, while synchronising both injector capacity and desired moulding features. For comprehensiveness, it was continuously sensitised over infinite scale as an explicit factor dependent on in-situ spatio-temporal injectant state perplexity with discrete slope and altitude for each polymeric character. In which congregant ranges of apparent viscosity and shear thinning index were conceived to characteristically assort most thermoplastics. Thereon results accorded aggressive conduit expansion widening for viscous incrust, while a very aggressive narrowing for shear thinning encrust; among them apparent viscosity had relative dominance. This important rationale would certainly form a priori design basis as well diagnose filling issues causing several defects. Like this the proposed generic design criteria, being simple would immensely benefit mould designers besides serve as an inexpensive preventive cliché to moulders. Its adaption ease to practice manifests a hope of injection moulding extremely alluring polymers. Therefore, we concluded that appreciating injectant׳s polymeric character to design exclusive <b>sprue</b> <b>bush</b> offers a definite a priori advantage...|$|E
40|$|A family mould {{consists}} of different shape of cavities used, while a multi cavity mould contains same shape of cavities to create injection products. The combinations {{of these features}} create a new family mould which is beneficial for the manufacturing cost and time reduction in injection moulding process. However, the main problem of the conventional family mould is the different cavity volume, led to an imbalance of melt filling behaviour. There are many successful family mould modifications which enabled a balance of melt filling such as an artificial balance runner system, runner shut-off system and variable runner system. Nevertheless, the inconsistencies of the melt filling behaviour in these family moulds are yet to be resolved especially when they are utilized in high mass production. Hence, {{the idea of an}} interchangeable turning <b>sprue</b> <b>bushing</b> (ITSB) insert was proposed in this study in order to overcome the imbalance of melt filling behaviour. The key for rotating ITSB insert was designed in three stages prior to a final ITSB design. The two chosen product geometry utilized were tensile and flexural test pieces, which were designed with the support of CAE analysis to obtain a favourable feeding system. With the incorporation of ITSB insert at the layout centre, the melt was able to shift in accordance to ITSB insert rotation. This allows filling of the tensile and flexural cavities during moulding at different times and different processing conditions, which resulted in melt filling balance behaviour. The optimization of the injection moulding process such as packing pressure, injection speed and holding time were successfully conducted through Scientific moulding analysis. The efficiency of the ITSB design and its consistency during production were successfully measured from the mass and wall thicknesses data during pilot production. In conclusion, ITSB insert was found to be a favourable optional design that can be considered for injection mould industry in order to produce multi design product...|$|R
