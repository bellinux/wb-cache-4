40|$|The {{widespread}} {{application of}} configuration optimization to industrial structures has been facing {{a number of}} difficulties. In particular, the difficulty of integrating design sensitivity analysis and geometric parameterization methods with CAD/CAE packages used at design offices has been one major obstacle. The main objective of this thesis {{is the development of}} an integrated environment suitable for optimal configuration design of industrial structures made of bar, beam, membrane and plate components. To fulfill this objective it was required to reach the secondary objectives described next. A new mathematical formulation for configuration design sensitivity analysis was developed by consistent derivation of the continuum equations, using the concept of material derivative. The expressions obtained are significantly simpler than the expressions obtained by other authors. A new configuration parameterization methodology was developed based upon the description of the geometry as it is created by a CAD system. The pre-defined parametric entities are associated to the boundary of the structural components being parameterized. New numeric algorithms have been implemented as well to allow efficient computation of the design velocity field in structures made of beam and plate components.

40|$|To {{the extent}} that {{deficiencies}} in GCM simulations of precipitation are due to persistent errors of location and timing, correcting the spatial and seasonal distribution of features would provide a physically based improvement in inter-model agreement on future changes. We use a tool {{for the analysis of}} medical images to warp the precipitation climatologies of 14 General Circulation Models (GCMs) closer to a reanalysis of observations, rather than adjusting intensities locally as in conventional bias correction techniques. These warps are then applied to the same GCMs' simulated changes in mean climate under a CO 2 quadrupling experiment. We find that the warping process not only makes GCMs' historical climatologies more closely resemble reanalysis but also reduces the disagreement between the models' response to this external forcing. Developing a tool that is tailored for the specific requirements of climate fields may provide further improvement, particularly in combination with local bias correction techniques. © 2013.

The growing capabilities of home computers, gaming consoles and mobile phones allow current games to visualise 3 D virtual worlds, photo-realistic characters and the inclusion of complex physical simulations. The growing computational power of those devices enables the usage of complex algorithms while visualising data. Therefore, opportunities arise for developers of interactive products such as digital games which introduce new, challenging and exciting elements to the next generation of highly interactive software systems. Two of those challenges, which current systems do not address adequately, are design support for creating Intelligent Virtual Agents and more believable non-player characters for immersive game-play. We start in this thesis by addressing the agent design <b>support</b> first <b>and</b> then extend the research, addressing the second challenge. The main contributions of this thesis are: - The POSH-SHARP system is a framework for the development of game agents. The platform is modular, extendable, offers multi-platform <b>support</b> <b>and</b> advanced <b>software</b> <b>development</b> features such as behaviour inspection and behaviour versioning. The framework additionally integrates an advanced information exchange mechanism supporting loose behaviour coupling. - The Agile behaviour design methodology integrates agile <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> agent design. To guide users, the approach presents a work-flow for agent design and guiding heuristics for their development. - The action selection augmentation ERGo introduces a "white-box" solution to altering existing agent frameworks, making their agents less deterministic. It augments selected behaviours with a bio-mimetic memory to track and adjust their activation over time. With the new approach to agent design, the development of "deepagent" behaviour for digital adversaries <b>and</b> advanced tools <b>supporting</b> their design is given. Such mechanisms should enable developers to build robust non-player characters that act more human-like in an efficient and robust manner. Within this thesis, different strategies are identified to support the design of agents in a more robust manner and to guide developers. These discussed mechanisms are then evolved to develop and design Intelligent Virtual Agents.

40|$|Introduction: Electronic health {{records from}} primary care, are now {{aggregated}} {{in a number}} of large datasets from primary care settings, containing both coded data and free-text. Secondary users can easily undertake analyses using coded data. However although the balance of information between these codes and free text is variable, they rarely use the information contained in doctors’ free-text notes - because of their ‘messy’ nature and the costs of ensuring anonymity. Our epidemiological studies within the Patient Records Enhancement Project has demonstrated that free text contains important information, that is often ignored. Method: Human computer interaction (HCI) studies, using qualitative approaches, can help us understand the reasons for variability in the balance of coded and free text data. We undertook field studies in six GP surgeries which included observations of record use across the surgery, video analysis of real patient consultations and interviews with a range of surgery staff. We also undertook ‘simulated’ consultations, with two medical actors playing the part of the patient, allowing us to standarise the patient across doctors and software systems. Results: Preliminary results suggest several reasons for variation in data recording. Doctors create notes in order to best manage patients with little consideration for use by others, and reported limited awareness of secondary uses of the information. Doctors often record and “read” a picture painted by the overall record of a consultation or record symptoms and signs in free text notes, and choose not to code a definite diagnosis. If coding, they often choose a more general non specific code, even when they have inferred and acted on a clear diagnosis. These approaches reflect processes of progressing from differential to definite diagnosis, and the surgery’s administrative and consultation processes. Conclusion: Our findings may explain apparent delays in diagnosis often observed in epidemiological analyses. The picture portrayed within records may not be at all clear to researchers relying on coded data. Our results have implications for secondary users of data and assessment of data for quality of care.

40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleWe {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the newest generation multi-model ensemble (MME) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5). We compare the ensemble to the previous generation models (CMIP 3) as well as several single model ensembles (SMEs), which are constructed by varying components of single models. These SMEs range from ensembles where parameter uncertainties are sampled (perturbed physics ensembles) through to an ensemble where a number of the physical schemes are switched (multi-physics ensemble). We focus on assessing reliability against present-day climatology with rank histograms, but also {{investigate the}} effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of the fields of variables which makes the statistical test of reliability more rigorous, and consider the distances between the observation and ensemble members. We find that the features of the CMIP 5 rank histograms, of general reliability on broad scales, are consistent with those of CMIP 3, suggesting a similar level of performance for present-day climatology. The spread of MMEs tends towards being "over-dispersed" rather than "under-dispersed". In general, the SMEs examined tend towards insufficient dispersion and the rank histogram analysis identifies them as being statistically distinguishable from many of the observations. The EDoFs of the MMEs are generally greater than those of SMEs, suggesting that structural changes lead to a characteristically richer range of model behaviours than is obtained with parametric/physical-scheme-switching ensembles. For distance measures, the observations and models ensemble members are similarly spaced from each other for MMEs, whereas for the SMEs, the observations are generally well outside the ensemble. We suggest that multi-model ensembles should represent an important component of uncertainty analysis. © 2013 The Author(s).

40|$|AcceptedArticle in PressThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. © 2016 The Author(s) The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is governed {{by a combination of}} amplifying and damping ocean–atmosphere feedbacks in the equatorial Pacific. Here we quantify these feedbacks in a flux adjusted HadCM 3 perturbed physics ensemble under present day conditions and a future emissions scenario using the Bjerknes Stability Index (BJ index). Relationships between feedbacks and both the present day biases and responses under climate change of the mean equatorial Pacific climate are investigated. Despite minimised mean sea surface temperature biases through flux adjustment, the important dominant ENSO feedbacks still show biases with respect to observed feedbacks and inter-ensemble diversity. The dominant positive thermocline and zonal advective feedbacks are found to be weaker in ensemble members with stronger mean zonal advection. This is due to a weaker sensitivity of the thermocline slope and zonal surface ocean currents in the east Pacific to surface wind stress anomalies. A drier west Pacific is also found to be linked to weakened shortwave and latent heat flux damping, suggesting a link between ENSO characteristics and the hydrological cycle. In contrast to previous studies using the BJ index that find positive relationships between the index and ENSO amplitude, here they are weakly or negatively correlated, both for present day conditions and for projected differences. This is caused by strong thermodynamic damping which dominates over positive feedbacks, which alone approximate ENSO amplitude well. While the BJ index proves useful for individual linear feedback analysis, we urge caution in using the total linear BJ index alone to assess the reasons for ENSO amplitude biases and its future change in models.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we present {{advances}} in forecasting Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) landfall statistics at both seasonal and multi-annual timescales using coupled global climate models. First, we demonstrate potential for forecasting TC landfall frequency on seasonal timescales using the Met Office seasonal forecast system, GloSea 5, in some regions: statistically significant skill {{is found in}} the Caribbean and moderate skill is found for Florida. In contrast, low skill is found along the US Coast as a whole. We show that the skill over the Caribbean is likely due to a good model response to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing. Lack of skill along the US Coast may be due to a weaker influence from ENSO compounded by a low bias in model storm tracks crossing the US coastline. Secondly, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} construct reliable 4 -year mean forecasts of landfalling hurricane numbers in the Atlantic using initialised global climate models to predict an index that relies on subpolar gyre temperature and subtropical sea level pressure, two quantities with links to hurricane activity. Furthermore, we give evidence that the forecast system anticipates large changes in at least one of the two components of this index, which suggests that the technique could be used to forecast shifts between active and inactive regimes of hurricane activity in the Atlantic.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the American Meteorological Society via the DOI in this record. Future climate change {{projections}} are often derived from ensembles of simulations from multiple global circulationmodels using heuristicweighting schemes. This study provides amore rigorous justification for this by introducing a nested family of three simple analysis of variance frameworks. Statistical frameworks are essential in order to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimate of the mean climate change response. The most general framework yields the "one model, one vote" weighting scheme often used in climate projection. However, a simpler additive framework is found to be preferable when the climate change response is not strongly model dependent. In such situations, the weighted multimodel mean may be interpreted as an estimate of the actual climate response, even in the presence of shared model biases. Statistical significance tests are derived to choose the most appropriate framework for specific multimodel ensemble data. The framework assumptions are explicit and can be checked using simple tests and graphical techniques. The frameworks can be used to test for evidence of nonzero climate response and to construct confidence intervals for the size of the response. The methodology is illustrated by application to North Atlantic storm track data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP 5) multimodel ensemble. Despite large variations in the historical storm tracks, the cyclone frequency climate change response is not found to be model dependent over most of the region. This gives high confidence in the response estimates. Statistically significant decreases in cyclone frequency are found on the flanks of the North Atlantic storm track and in the Mediterranean basin. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

40|$|LetterUncertainties in the {{response}} of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate change. Climate-carbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, {{the magnitude of this}} CO 2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO 2 fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO 2 seasonal cycle that are thought {{to be the result of}} increasing terrestrial GPP. Our comparison of atmospheric CO 2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climate-carbon cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO 2 seasonal cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP, driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO 2 fertilization controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship between the amplitude of the CO 2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO 2 fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO 2 amplitude, these relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO 2 fertilization of GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 37 [*]±[*] 9 per cent for high-latitude ecosystems and 32 [*]±[*] 9 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi records, respectively.

Numerous components of the Arctic freshwater system (atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and terrestrial hydrology) have experienced large changes over the past few decades, and these changes are projected to amplify further in the future. Observations are particularly sparse, in both time and space, in the polar regions. Hence, modeling systems have been widely used and are a powerful tool to gain understanding on the functioning of the Arctic freshwater system and its integration within the global Earth system and climate. Here we present a review of modeling studies addressing some aspect of the Arctic freshwater system. Through illustrative examples, we point out the value of using a hierarchy of models with increasing complexity and component interactions, in order to dismantle the important processes at play for the variability and changes of the different components of the Arctic freshwater system and the interplay between them. We discuss past and projected changes for the Arctic freshwater system and explore the sources of uncertainty associated with these model results. We further elaborate on some missing processes that should be included in future generations of Earth system models and highlight the importance of better quantification and understanding of natural variability, among other factors, for improved predictions of Arctic freshwater system change.

40|$|We analyse {{the spatial}} {{expression}} of seasonal climates of the Mediterranean and northern Africa in pre-industrial (piControl) and mid-Holocene (midHolocene, 6 yr BP) simulations from the fifth {{phase of the}} Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5). Modern observations show four distinct precipitation regimes characterized by differences in the seasonal distribution and total amount of precipitation: an equatorial band characterized by a double peak in rainfall, the monsoon zone characterized by summer rainfall, the desert characterized by low seasonality and total precipitation, and the Mediterranean zone characterized by summer drought. Most models correctly simulate {{the position of the}} Mediterranean and the equatorial climates in the piControl simulations, but overestimate the extent of monsoon influence and underestimate the extent of desert. However, most models fail to reproduce the amount of precipitation in each zone. Model biases in the simulated magnitude of precipitation are unrelated to whether the models reproduce the correct spatial patterns of each regime. In the midHolocene, the models simulate a reduction in winter rainfall in the equatorial zone, and a northward expansion of the monsoon with a significant increase in summer and autumn rainfall. Precipitation is slightly increased in the desert, mainly in summer and autumn, with northward expansion of the monsoon. Changes in the Mediterranean are small, although there is an increase in spring precipitation consistent with palaeo-observations of increased growing-season rainfall. Comparison with reconstructions shows most models underestimate the mid-Holocene changes in annual precipitation, except in the equatorial zone. Biases in the piControl; have only a limited influence on midHolocene anomalies in ocean-atmosphere models; carbon-cycle models show no relationship between piControl bias and midHolocene anomalies. Biases in the prediction of the midHolocene monsoon expansion are unrelated to how well the models simulate changes in Mediterranean climate. © 2014 Author (s). This work was initiated when A.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from European Geosciences Union via the DOI in this record. A {{community}} diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) has been developed that allows for routine comparison of single or multiple models, either against predecessor versions or against observations. The priority of the effort so far has been to target specific scientific themes focusing on selected essential climate variables (ECVs), a range of known systematic biases common to ESMs, such as coupled tropical climate variability, monsoons, Southern Ocean processes, continental dry biases, and soil hydrology-climate interactions, as well as atmospheric CO 2 budgets, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. The tool is being developed in such a way that additional analyses can easily be added. A set of standard namelists for each scientific topic reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community effort open to both users and developers encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art <b>and</b> aims at <b>supporting</b> such activities within CMIP and at individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while utilizing observations available in standard formats (obs 4 MIPs) or provided by the user. The development of the ESMValTool (v 1. 0) was funded by the European Commission’s 7 th Framework Programme, under Grant Agreement number 282672, the “Earth system Model Bias Reduction and assessing Abrupt Climate change (EMBRACE) ” project and the DLR “Earth System Model Validation (ESMVal) ” and “Klimarelevanz von atmosphärischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken: Auf dem Weg zu EarthCARE und MERLIN (KliSAW) ” projects. In addition, financial support for the development of ESMValTool (v 1. 0) was provided by ESA’s Climate Change Initiative Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG).

40|$|PublishedWe {{describe}} the main differences in simulations of stratospheric climate and variability by models within the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) {{that have a}} model top above the stratopause and relatively fine stratospheric vertical resolution (high-top), and those that have a model top below the stratopause (low-top). Although the simulation of mean stratospheric climate by the two model ensembles is similar, the low-top model ensemble has very weak stratospheric variability on daily and interannual time scales. The frequency of major sudden stratospheric warming events is strongly underestimated by the low-top models with {{less than half the}} frequency of events observed in the reanalysis data and high-top models. The lack of stratospheric variability in the low-top models affects their stratosphere-troposphere coupling, resulting in short-lived anomalies in the Northern Annular Mode, which do not produce long-lasting tropospheric impacts, as seen in observations. The lack of stratospheric variability, however, {{does not appear to have}} any impact on the ability of the low-top models to reproduce past stratospheric temperature trends. We find little improvement in the simulation of decadal variability for the high-top models compared to the low-top, which is likely related to the fact that neither ensemble produces a realistic dynamical response to volcanic eruptions. © 2013.
