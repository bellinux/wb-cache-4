5|$|The {{relative}} position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies <b>straight</b> <b>above</b> the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
25|$|Pécs is {{open from}} the south. Mecsek lifts up to 400–600 {{meters from the}} Pécsi plain of about 120–130 meters. Jakab-hill, located in western Mecsek, is 592m high, Tubes, <b>straight</b> <b>above</b> Pécs, is 612 m, and Misina is 535 m. Higher {{parts of the city}} climb up to 200–250 m, mainly Pécsbánya, Szabolcsfalu, Vasas and Somogy. Graveyards pulled back to a {{relatively}} small area. Woody areas generally start from about 300 m height. Mecsek is divided by several valleys which have key role in ameliorating the climate of the city without lakes and rivers. Waters coming down from Mecsek are collected by Pécsi water under the east-west rail road leading them eventually to the Danube.|$|E
25|$|This statue to {{the right}} speaks well for the {{equality}} of gender in ancient Egypt that a private lady could have a sculpture made for herself. The heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes behind the ears, thus giving the impression of forcing them forward. They are large {{in keeping with the}} ancient Egyptian ideal of beauty; the same ideal required small breasts, and also in this respect the sculpture is no exception. Whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose, the artificial eyebrows in low relief are absolutely <b>straight</b> <b>above</b> the inner corners of the eyes, a feature which places the bust early in Dynasty XII. Around 1900 B.C. these artificial eyebrows, too, began to follow the natural curve and dipped toward the nose.|$|E

500|$|The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail {{with bright}} grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, {{and it had}} a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. Its exact size is unknown, but it was {{about the size of a}} chicken, and {{somewhat}} smaller than the related red rail. Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was [...] long and [...] wide. The cranium had a narrow, long frontal region, [...] at its least width. The beak varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, and others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. It is unknown whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. The culmen of the beak was almost <b>straight</b> <b>above</b> the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium. The beak was up to [...] long, the lower jaw up to [...] long, and [...] at its greatest depth. The scapula (shoulder blade) was [...] long, the humerus ranged from , and the ulna from [...] The pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was [...] long, [...] wide at the front, and [...] wide at the back.

50|$|However, {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the overall design whilst the locomotive was under production at Eastleigh Works. The earlier class members mounted a lower running plate that was raised above the cylinders for clearance. These locomotives also sported a single, <b>straight</b> splasher <b>above</b> the driving wheels, an embellishment that would feature on Urie's later N15 class. The later production locomotives did not feature this design, with a higher-mounted <b>straight</b> running plate <b>above</b> the driving wheels, a feature that was perpetuated on the later S15 class design by Urie.|$|R

60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{a cloud of}} smoke arose above the man, and {{presently}} the loud report of a roer reached their ears.

60|$|The road {{goes down}} through another valley, {{and then finally}} begins to scale the main slope of the Pentlands.
