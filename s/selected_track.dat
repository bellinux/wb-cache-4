Also in 1986, the park opened the Music Bowl (later Dreamworld Amphitheatre and Dreamworld Studios) and had its first after-dark opening.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{particular}} interest to many observers were the Military Road Switchers designated MRS-1 and built specifically for the US Army Transportation Corps. These engines were constructed by the Electromotive Division of General Motors and by the American Locomotive Company (Alco) with trucks that could adjust to accommodate <b>selected</b> <b>track</b> gauges between [...] and broader gauges up to [...] The reason for this was the potential use of these locomotives on the railroad networks of Europe and the USSR where broader gauges precluded the use of unmodified US locomotives {{in the event of}} a major war. While built to the same specifications, there were external differences between the EMD and Alco MRS-1s as can be seen in the rooflines.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th round, the San Francisco Warriors {{selected}} Denise Long, a girl's {{high school}} player from Whitten, Iowa.

He had just broke the world record for long jump and {{won the gold medal}} at the 1968 Olympic Games.

50|$|In {{the music}} player, when {{selecting}} an {{entry in the}} playlist at a position higher than 255 the player has a wrap around bug and will play the entry 255 positions before the one selected. For example, if entry 260 is selected entry 5 will be played, if entry 300 is selected entry 45 will be played. This {{is caused by the}} music player using an unsigned 8-bit integer to store the <b>selected</b> <b>track.</b> This bug is present on the 6230, 6230i and early versions of the 6233. The work around is use the playlist to see the entry number, then go back to the currently playing entry and type in the number of the entry you want (jump to).|$|E
5000|$|Time Trial - This is a single-player-only mode {{where the}} {{objective}} is to complete a three-lap race on the <b>selected</b> <b>track</b> in the shortest total time possible. There are no opponent racers or item boxes, though the player will always begin each race with a Triple Mushroom in reserve. For any given course the top five shortest total times are saved, and the shortest single lap time of any race is also saved. The player can select to race against a ghost character who will mimic the movement of the player from a previous race. Ghost data for up to two different courses can be saved permanently only on a Controller Pak device. However, the Virtual Console version of Mario Kart 64 released on the Wii is incompatible with the device and is thus unable to save ghost data.|$|E
