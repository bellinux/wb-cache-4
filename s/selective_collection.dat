In field observations of expert clinicians caring for patients in critical care units, bundles appear to be a widely used means of managing information to support diverse, complex, and often simultaneous tasks. They may be especially useful in settings that are characterized by high uncertainty, low predictability, frequent interruptions, and potentially grave outcomes; where time and attention are highly constrained; and where interdisciplinary teamwork is essential. Reports of analogous observations from other domains such as aviation and air traffic control suggest that bundles may be a common information management tool for solving problems and maintaining situation awareness. In an age of digital libraries, computer-based tools for creating and managing bundles may be useful as the information in these settings is increasingly represented in digital collections that are larger, more complex, more diverse, and potentially more difficult to explore and manipulate...|$|R

5000|$|Compared to {{developed}} OECD states, Brazil has a fairly low total recycling rate, being at 2% of created waste. [...] As in 2012 merely 14% of municipalities provided {{selective waste collection}} - with 86% of these municipalities located in either the South or Southeastern region - the country relies heavily on waste pickers. Additionally to that, only 64% {{of the population has}} access to regular garbage collection. Yet, the situation is improving since the absolute number of municipalities offering <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> rose from 443 in 2010 to 766 in 2012.Despite its low overall recycling rate, Brazil is the world leader in recycling aluminum. Having set a record recycling rate of 98,4% of aluminum, the country was able to top its record 97,1% from 2013 by another 1,3%. The main reason for the extreme aluminum recycling rate are the rising energy costs - which will continue to rise given the increasing hydropower prices caused by the 2015 drought - and consequently, the high expenses that are associated with the production of new aluminum. As between March 2014 and March 2015 the cost of energy rose by 60% and since recycling aluminum requires 95% less energy than producing new material, the recycling rates have kept rising while smelter plants have been shutting down production. PET is the second most recycled packaging material in Brazil with 54% of PET having been recycled in 2014. However, due to lower production costs this rate is yet much smaller than the percentage of recycled aluminum. Given its very low production costs as well as the more expensive processes needed to recycle the material, plastics exhibit the lowest recycling rate among the most common packaging materials. The Brazilian beauty care and cosmetics brand Sejaa serves as an example for products that use recycled packaging. Sejaa, which was launched by Brazilian fashion model Gisele Bündchen uses fibers consisting to 100% of recycled post-consumer waste paper and is Forest Stewardship certified. Another example is Brazilian pulp and paper manufacturer Suzano, which since 2012 produces paperboard made from Post consumer resin (PCR) by extracting fibers from long life packaging such as milk cartons.|$|E
40|$|European waste {{legislation}} has been encouraging {{for years the}} incorporation of <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> systems for the biowaste fraction. European countries are therefore incorporating it into their current municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems. However, this incorporation involves changes in the current waste management habits of households. In this paper, {{the attitude of the}} public towards the incorporation of <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste into an existing MSWM system in a Spanish municipality is analysed. A semi-structured telephone interview was used to obtain information regarding aspects such as: level of participation in current waste collection systems, willingness to participate in <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste, reasons and barriers that affect participation, willingness to pay for the incorporation of the <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste and the socioeconomic characteristics of citizens who are willing to participate and pay for <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste. The results showed that approximately 81 % of the respondents were willing to participate in <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> of biowaste. This percentage would increase until 89 % if the Town Council provided specific waste bins and bags, since the main barrier to participate in the new <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> system is the need to use specific waste bin and bags for the separation of biowaste. A logit response model was applied to estimate the average willingness to pay, obtaining an estimated mean of 7. 5 % on top of the current waste management annual tax. The relationship of willingness to participate and willingness to pay for the implementation of this new <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> with the socioeconomic variables (age, gender, size of the household, work, education and income) was analysed. Chi-square independence tests and binary logistic regression was used for willingness to participate, not being obtained any significant relationship.

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} materials can {{address some of}} the issues associated with the cost and environmental implications of non-renewable materials. So the prime aim of this work was to determine the thermodynamic changes in the polypropylene (PP) mixtures depending on the percentage amount of different origin recyclates for sustainable nanocomposites. In this study, different polypropylene mixtures with the addition of PP recyclates from a <b>selective</b> waste <b>collection</b> system and in-plant recycling system have been subjected to detailed analysis. It was obvious that recyclates from technological waste were of higher quality than post-user recyclates obtained from a <b>selective</b> waste <b>collection</b> system. The influence of the source of the recyclates on the different properties of the processed materials has been studied in detail. The content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates was found to explain the unexpected influence of the recyclates content on the properties of the final product. A mathematical model was also formulated to calculate the content of the material with certain amount of recirculations in the in-plant recycling system since no analyses concerning the content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates added to the original material were found in the literature...|$|R
