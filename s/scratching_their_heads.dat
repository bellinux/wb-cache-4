25|$|In November 1971 the Astros and Cincinnati Reds {{made one}} of the biggest {{blockbuster}} trades {{in the history of the}} sport, and helped create The Big Red Machine of the 1970s, with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. Houston sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, outfielder César Gerónimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jimmy Stewart. The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> as to why General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore up many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1972.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, {{where the}} Super Bowl {{telecast}} was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians {{complained about the}} incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC). The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about {{other aspects of the}} Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simsub issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).

2500|$|In November 1971, The Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds made a {{trade that}} was one of the most {{impactful}} in the history of the sport, and helped create [...] "The Big Red Machine" [...] of the 1970s, with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. [...] The [...] Astros sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, and outfielders César Gerónimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jim Stewart. [...] The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world <b>scratching</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> as to why Astros General Manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. [...] May and Helms were good talents but both had obvious weaknesses. [...] The Reds on the other hand would shore up many problems. They had an off-year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1970. [...] They had plenty of power at the plate in Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Lee May. The problem was, they were all right-handed batters and two of the three were first basemen. [...] Three sluggers batting in a row in the middle of the Reds lineup caused issues: First, it left them vulnerable to right-handed pitching; next, there was the problem of double play balls killing a rally; finally, Perez, a first baseman, was placed at third in order to have both May and Perez in the line-up. [...] Perez at third base caused a fielding weakness. [...] Now with Menke, a proven veteran that could play third, Perez could move to first, thus strengthening the left side of the field. [...] They also got the 6ft 4in Billigham, who was just entering his prime as a pitcher and would go on to help lead the Big Red Machine to back-to-back World Series in 1975 and 1976. [...] The deal turned out to be more than just Morgan for May, but Morgan turning out to be a great second baseman for the Astros, to a second baseman that would turn out to be an all-time great, just made the deal that much better for the Reds.|$|E
