40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonparametric model for estimating sharp bounds on the median of the disturbances in the simultaneous equations model and applies it to {{estimation of the}} <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand shift variables. A large literature has estimated shift variables in a <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand framework to analyze {{the causes of the}} fluctuations of the key economic variables. In the existing parametric approaches, the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand shift variables are, however, unidentified either by using only observa-tions of the intersections of the S&D curves or without specifying the S&D functional forms and distributions for the disturbances. In contrast, the model in this paper requires only observations of the intersections of upward-sloping <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> downward-sloping demand curves. It is ap-plied to estimation of the bounds on macro <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand shocks since model specification issues have been serious area of conflict in study of the sources of business fluctuations, and estimation of the bounds on labor <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand shift variables since an existing research on the causes of wage changes could not identify <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> demand shifters due to the availability of data...|$|R

Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain <b>supplies</b> (<b>and</b> a millstone for grinding), medical <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E

Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups, but conflicts arose over <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men.
