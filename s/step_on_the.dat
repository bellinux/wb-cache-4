5|$|Odaenathus {{controlled}} a {{large area}} of the Roman East and held the highest political and military authority in the region, superseding that of the Roman provincial governors. His self-created status was formalized by Emperor Gallienus, who {{had little choice but}} to acquiesce. Odaenathus's power relative to that of the emperor and the central authority was unprecedented and elastic, but relations remained smooth until his death. His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers' authority and position had to be clarified, which led to a conflict over their interpretation. The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman official who derived his power from the emperor, but the Palmyrene court saw his position as hereditary. This conflict was the first <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to war between Rome and Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the newest}} traditions on the UCF campus {{pertains}} to the Pegasus seal {{in the center of}} the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim signed Ramírez as an {{international}} free agent in February 2001. He made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Arizona Angels of the Rookie-level Arizona League in the 2002 season. He pitched in 13 games for Arizona, and also pitched in two games for the Provo Angels of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. The Angels promoted Ramírez to Class A in the 2003 season. He pitched for the Cedar Rapids Kernels in the Class A Midwest League. He reached the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class A-Advanced California League. When the Angels invited players of the Quakes to Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Ramírez refused to leave the bleachers and <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field unless {{he was invited to}} play for the Angels.|$|E

5|$|The University seal as it {{is today}} is {{symbolic}} of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green. It is said that students who <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seal will not graduate on time.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, {{to bring it up}} {{to the level of the}} projecting <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E
5|$|The rocket {{lands in}} the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human to <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} tank to explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of}} the Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E

5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path to an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure {{to act on the}} deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E

5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E

25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on mountain, hybrid, and touring bicycles with three chainrings. The relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chainrings (say 25% to 35%) is typically around twice the relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cogset (say 15%), e.g. chainrings 28-38-48 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28.|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four}} times the relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
