40|$|A spray-suppression {{model that}} captures {{the effects of}} liquid {{suppressant}} on a turbulent combusting flow is developed and applied to a turbulent diffusion flame with water <b>spray</b> <b>suppression.</b> The spray submodel {{is based on a}} stochastic separated flow approach that accounts for the transport and evaporation of liquid droplets. Flame extinguishment is accounted for by using a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) submodel of turbulent combustion. PSR pre-calculations of flame extinction times are determined using CHEMKIN and are compared to local turbulent time scales of the flow to determine if local flame extinguishment has occurred. The PSR flame extinguishment and spray submodels are incorporated into Sandia's flow fire simulation code, VULCAN, and cases are run for the water <b>spray</b> <b>suppression</b> studies of McCaffrey for turbulent hydrogen-air jet diffusion flames. Predictions of flame temperature decrease and suppression efficiency are compared to experimental data as a function of water mass loading using three assumed values of drop sizes. The results show that the suppression efficiency is highly dependent on the initial droplet size for a given mass loading. A predicted optimal suppression efficiency was observed for the smallest class of droplets while the larger drops show increasing suppression efficiency with increasing mass loading for the range of mass loadings considered. Qualitative agreement to the experiment of suppression efficiency is encouraging, however quantitative agreement is limited due to the uncertainties in the boundary conditions of the experimental data for the water spray...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedA novel {{laboratory}} apparatus {{has been}} built to understand the key mechanisms behind spray emerging from a rolling tire. Several researchers have assessed the performance of <b>spray</b> <b>suppression</b> devices; however, there are no known efforts that address the question "what needs to be suppressed?" This investigation into how water in a tire groove evolves into a droplet field will ultimately contribute to driver safety.; Using high-speed imaging, water passing through a single circumferential groove was observed to leave the tire patch {{in the form of}} a thin liquid sheet, connecting the roadway and the tire. The sheet disintegrates into a droplet field and the breakup modes associated with this decay were identified with respect to Weber number.; Weber numbers based on the properties of water, tire speed and tire groove width were tested at 2700, 10900 and 24400. Measurements for the breakup length of the liquid sheet showed a dependence on Weber number proportional to We^(- 1 / 6). The lateral displacement of the water exiting the tire patch was also measured. These tests showed the overall size of the spray field grows with We; however, the maximum water volume for all We's was delivered to the same distance from the road.; Downstream from the tire patch, a determination of the droplet field was performed. From this study, the distribution of droplet sizes was determined as a function of Weber number. At We= 2, 700, droplet sizes between 80 and 9000 micrometers were detected, with a mean diameter near 800 micrometers. Both the range of droplet sizes and the mean diameter were found to decrease with Weber number by approximately We^(- 1 / 2). Based on these size distributions, Correlation Image Velocimetry (CIV) was used to estimate the distribution of droplet velocities as function of their size. These results reveal a strong correlation between droplet diameter and velocity which is comparable to that predicted for a simple sphere...|$|E

In basic pendant sprinkler configurations, the spray originates from two streams corresponding to flow deflected along the tines of the pendant and flow passing through the void spaces between the tines. In this study, measurements of flow splits (between space and tine streams), sheet breakup distances, drop size, and drop velocity measurements were performed over a range of sprinkler geometries and injection pressures to characterize the near-field sprinkler spray. These detailed measurements were used to support the development of scaling laws describing the effects of injector geometry and injection conditions on sprinkler discharge characteristics...|$|R

Using a full-scale mock-up of a continuous mining machine, preliminary work showed that these side <b>sprays</b> improved <b>suppression</b> of the dust cloud and redistributed this cloud under the cutting head. This led to reductions in dust levels around the machine and in down-wind airways for some positions of theminingmachine. This testing also showed that side spray effectiveness was in u-enced by the distance from the fresh air ventilation device to the cutting surface, termed the ventilation setback distance. These sprays produced larger reductions inmachine and re-turn dust levels at smaller setback distances than at larger setback distances. These side sprays then were installed in similar locations on a mining machine at an underground coal mine operation to evaluate their effectiveness for im-proving suppression and capture of dust by the ooded-bed dust scrubber. Although sampling could not be conducted successfully in the return, sampling around the mining ma-chine and at the machine operator showed that dust levels decreased with use of these sprays.

Mass loss of the furniture items was measured {{at the end of each}} test and was showed to relate well to the area of origin. Areas along the wall surfaces that were white in color directly adjacent to areas of significant soot deposition were found within this series of tests to be attributed to the oxidation of the soot from the surface (i.e. clean burn) and with wash from the hoseline for suppression. Also, the study illustrated that drywall seams, if no tape and mud was applied, would present areas of clean burn damage during ventilation-controlled conditions (Mealy et al. 2013).|$|R

A variety of spray generation methods ranging from simple hose stream approaches to sophisticated water mist techniques have been developed and refined {{over the past century}} to address a diversity of fire protection challenges.

As a result, engineering analysis of these devices is riddled with empiricism from design conceptualization to performance evaluation. While computational design tools are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of fire protection applications, lack of knowledge regarding spray generation has limited the utility of computational tools for fire suppression problems.

40|$|Journal articleThe aim of {{this study}} was to design and execute a pilot study to collect {{information}} on the personal exposure levels of podiatrists to microbial hazards in podiatry clinics and also to assess health and safety knowledge within the sector using a questionnaire survey. A self-report quantitative questionnaire dealing with health and safety/health issues was issued to 250 podiatrist clinics. Fifteen podiatry clinics were randomly recruited to participate in the exposure study. Concentrations of airborne bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and moulds were assessed using a six-stage viable microbial cascade impactor. Personal samples of total inhalable dust and endotoxin were measured in the breathing zone of the podiatrist. A questionnaire response rate of 42 % (N = 101) was achieved. Thirty-two per cent of respondents indicated that they had a respiratory condition; asthma was the most prevalent condition reported. The most frequently employed control measures reported were use of disposable gloves during patient treatments (73. 3 %), use of respiratory protective equipment (34. 6 %), use of protective aprons (16. 8 %), and eye protection (15. 8 %). A total of 15. 8 % of respondents used mechanical room ventilation, 47. 5 % used nail drills with local exhaust ventilation systems, and 11 % used nail drills with water <b>spray</b> dust <b>suppression.</b> The geometric mean concentrations of bacteria, Staphylococci, fungi, and yeasts/moulds were 590, 190, 422, and 59 CFU m(- 3), respectively.

At the same time, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis {{is becoming an}} accepted method for evaluating fire hazards and fire protection design performance. Water mist system design and development would benefit greatly from CFD based analysis. However, the fire suppression problem is extremely complex concerning many aspects of fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and combustion. For accurate simulations, CFD models describing these physics are required along with establishing appropriate practices for computational problem definition. The current study focuses on atomization and dispersion. Spray measurements, models, and simulations are presented and evaluated for high pressure (above 80 bar) water mist systems.

40|$|Citrus (Citrus sinensis) is an {{important}} crop in Uganda, where it is produced for both domestic consumption and regional markets. Unfortunately it is increasingly devastated by canker disease. Several measures are often recommended for citrus canker management worldwide; the major ones being orchard inspection, quarantines, protective copper sprays and the on-site burning of infected trees. The adoption rate for these options in Northern Uganda has not been possible and as a result, the disease has reached epiphytotic level. Cultural practices and phytosanitary measures, consisting of removal of inoculum sources, timely application of protective chemical sprays and field sanitation could restore citrus orchards in areas affected by citrus canker.

The experimental results show that water injection clearly disrupts shock noise sources within the jet plume, with large reductions in radiated shock noise. There are smaller reductions in jet mixing noise, resulting in only a small decrease in effective perceived noise level when projections are made to full scale. The fact that the measured noise reduction in the direction upstream of the nozzle was consistently larger than in the noisier downstream direction contributed to keeping effective perceived noise reductions small.

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{use of chemical}} insecticides against mosqui-toes {{has led to the}} development of widespread insecticide resistance. Control of Anopheles mosquitoes in malaria-endemic areas of Sub-Saharan Africa has become increas-ingly difficult [1]. There is an urgent need for malaria control programs to adopt more integrated mosquito management approaches that include sustainable, non-chemical solutions. In this perspective, insect parasitic nematodes specific to mosquitoes [2, 3] may be considered as alternatives, to help reduce reliance on insecticides, and concurrently help insecticide resistance management. The present work has tested the effect of the Mermithid nema-tode, Romanomermis iyengari, against Anopheles gambiae s. s. Giles in laboratory and field conditions in Benin, West Africa. Materials and methods The nematodes R. iyengari were mass produced and the pre-parasitic juvenile (J 2) were used in all laboratory and field experiments. Under laboratory conditions, 2 different concentrations of pre-parasitic nematodes (5 and 10 J 2 per larvae) were tested against first to third instar (L 1, L 2 and L 3) larvae of An. gambiae. In field, the pre-parasitic nema-todes were monthly sprayed into 2 different Anopheles natural breeding sites in Cotonou, south Benin; 3500 and 5000 J 2 per square meter of stagnant water were released, respectively in site 1 and 2. Results Results indicated that in laboratory, 100 % L 1 larvae died within 24 hours post-infection and 100 % of both L 2 and L 3 larvae died within 7 days post-infection, regardless of nematode concentration. In field, Anopheles larval den-sity 5 days post-application decreased from 35 larvae per liter to 4 larvae, and from 17 larvae to 1, respectively in site 1 and 2. During a whole rainy season in 2011, monthly nematodes <b>spraying</b> resulted in <b>suppression</b> of larval An. gambiae in treated sites. Conclusions The present study indicated that the Mermithid nema-tode R. iyengari is effective for malaria vector control in Benin, West Africa.

40|$|The use {{of toxic}} protein bait sprays to {{suppress}} melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae), populations typically involves application to vegetation bordering agricultural host {{areas where the}} adults seek shelter (“roost”). Although bait <b>spray</b> applications for <b>suppression</b> of oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), populations have traditionally been applied to the host crop, rather than to crop borders, roosting by oriental fruit flies in borders of some crop species, such as papaya, Carica papaya L. (Brassicales: Caricaceae), suggests that bait spray applications to crop borders could also help in suppression of B. dorsalis populations. In order to develop improved recommendations for application of bait sprays to border plants for suppression of melon fly and oriental fruit fly populations, the relative attractiveness {{of a range of}} plant species, in a vegetative (non-flowering) stage, was tested to wild melon fly and oriental fruit fly populations established in a papaya orchard in Hawaii. A total of 20 plant species were evaluated, divided into four categories: 1) border plants, including corn, Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae), windbreaks and broad-leaved ornamentals, 7 species; 2) weed plants commonly found in agricultural fields in Hawaii, 6 species; 3) host crop plants, 1 species- zucchini, Cucurbita pepo L. (Violales: Curcurbitaceae), and 4) locally grown fruit trees, 6 species. Plants were established in pots and placed in an open field, in clusters encircling protein bait traps, 20 m away from the papaya orchard. Castor bean, Ricinus communis L. (Euphorbiales: Euphorbiaceae), panax, Polyscias guilfoylei (Bull) Bailey (Apiales: Araliaceae), tiger's claw, Erythnna variegata L. (Fabales: Fabaceae), and guava, Psidium guajava L. (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) were identified as preferred roosting hosts for the melon fly, and tiger's claw, panax, castor bean, Canada cocklebur, Xanthium strumarium L.

Guava had not previously been identified as a preferred roosting host for melon fly. Other than for the use of panax as a roosting host, there has previously been little attention to roosting hosts for oriental fruit fly.

40|$|The use {{of water}} mists (very fine water <b>sprays)</b> for fire <b>suppression</b> is {{currently}} receiving increased attention {{as a replacement}} technology for halogen-based chemical agents-such as Halon 1301 (CF 3 Br) [...] the manufacturing {{of which has been}} banned by the Montreal Protocol due to their high ozone depletion potential. Water mist technology has been found effective {{for a wide range of}} applications such as Class B pool fires, shipboard machinery, aircraft cabins, computers, and electronic equipment. There are five distinct mechanisms by which water droplets may interact with a flame. First, the high enthalpy of vaporization of water (2450 kJ/kg) leads to heat removal from the flame front as the liquid droplets turn to steam. Second, as water vaporizes its volume increases approximately three orders of magnitude, which leads to the dilution of the oxygen and vaporized fuel required to maintain the flame. The third effect is the recombination of H-atoms and other radicals on the droplet surface. A fourth effect of water mists in fires is the retardation of surface propagation rates due to the wetting of walls and surfaces. The last potential impact of fine water mists affects the radiative propagation of the fire by forming an optically thick barrier to infrared radiation which prevents ignition of the unburned regions. Unfortunately, little fundamental information exists on the interaction of a flame with a water mist. To date, there is no widely accepted interpretation of the critical concentration of droplets required to suppress a flame or of the fundamental mechanisms involved in flame extinguishment by water mists. One of the main obstacles to obtaining such understanding is the difficulty of providing a simple, well-defined experimental setup for the flame front/water mist interaction. Some of the difficulty stems from the problem of generating, distributing and maintaining a homogeneous concentration of droplets throughout a chamber while gravity depletes the concentration and alters the droplet size by coalescence and agglomeration mechanisms. Experiments conducted in the absence of gravity provide an ideal environment to study the interaction of water mists and flames by eliminating these distorting effects. In addition, microgravity eliminates the complex flow patterns induced between the flame front and the water droplets. The long duration and quality of microgravity in space flights provide the required conditions to perform the setup and monitoring of flame suppression experiments. Consequently, a series of experiments have been identified to be performed on the Combustion Module (CM- 2) in the Space Shuttle. These consist of measuring the extinguishing capability of a water mist on a premixed flame propagating along a tube. These experiments should provide the necessary data to obtain further understanding of the water mist suppression phenomena that can be later used to design and manufacture appropriate fire suppression systems. In preparation for the orbital flights, experiments have been conducted on low-gravity ground facilities to obtain the preliminary data necessary to define the scientific objectives and technical issues of the spacecraft experiments...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the first systematic investigation and characterisation {{of the burning}} behaviour of untreated heavy gas oil from the Canadian oil sands, an intermediate product in the upgrading process of forming synthetic crude oil from bitumen. As this oil is an intermediate product and has little commercial value, {{there has been little}} characterisation of the burning behaviour or propensity for boilover of the fuel. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the global burning behaviour of untreated heavy gas oil in the effort to document key fire parameters and unique burning characteristics of the fuel, and compare with those presented in literature. This experimental series consisted of measurements of the heat release rate, rate of fuel consumption, and flame spread rate, as well as observations of overall pool fire behaviour, using heavy gas oil as well as kerosene as a reference. Further experiments investigated the effects of water <b>suppression</b> <b>spray</b> on the pool fire behaviour, and the propensity for boilover during small-scale fires. It was found that the fire properties of heavy gas oil were consistent with those of other heavy oils, most notably those of heavy fuel oil. The burning behaviour of the heavy gas oil was well represented by the traditional correlations for fire behaviour of heavy hydrocarbon fuels. Some of the measured properties for the heavy gas oil included an infinite diameter fuel regression rate of 3. 0 mm/min, heat of combustion of 43. 5 MJ/kg, and flame spread rate of 0. 8 cm/s. Temperatures measured through the depth of the fuel layer indicated that a hot-zone did not form, and the observation was confirmed based on mass burning rates and fuel boiling temperatures that did not vary over the burning duration. At low initial fuel temperatures, the burning of the heavy gas oil was intensified by water emulsified within the oil, which led to an increase in each of the measured fire characteristics, especially that of flame spread rate. In this case, small volumes of flaming oil were projected out of the test pans, as well as into the flame column. Furthermore, the heavy gas oil was found to ‘weather’ over time, resulting in an oil with higher density and lower volatility, which caused each of the measured fire properties to decrease during the six month weathering period considered here. The heavy gas oil in the present experiments was found to have a significant propensity to mix with steam, forming a froth-like substance that expanded in volume across the surface of the fuel. This phenomenon was observed when <b>suppression</b> water was <b>sprayed</b> on the heated fuel surface, as well as in fires established over deep pools of fuel with a water sublayer. The expansion of the froth resulted in overflow of burning fuel from the experimental test pans, and thus caused fire spread beyond the pan walls. Finally, thin layer boilover was observed in heavy gas oil pool fires with a water sublayer, leading to both an increase in fire intensity and fire spread beyond the test pans...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{control is}} a very {{significant}} issue in underground coal mining. The benefits of reducing dust levels will be a lesser risk of lung disease to coal miners, improved working conditions and a reduced risk of dust explosions. Coal dust is commonly suppressed by water <b>sprays</b> but <b>suppression</b> efficiency is not high because dust tends to travel in the air flow round the water droplets rather than being captured by them. If water sprays are electrostatically charged, then a significant improvement in dust suppression efficiency may be achieved. Of the three principal droplet charging mechanisms, i. e. corona charging, induction charging and contact charging, corona charging is {{the most widely used}} in many industrial fields including dust suppression, However, it requires a high applied voltage, ranging from thousands to more than a hundred thousand volts, depending on the geometry of the charging equipment. Induction charging has been used in agricultural spraying since Law (1978) developed an embedded-electrode induction charging spraying nozzle. This nozzle provides a compact, inexpensively fabricated droplet charger and, reduces design requirements on size and output voltage (of the order of 1000 volts). It also reduces the potential for mechanical damage, misalignment and personnel hazard. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} dust suppression, either the charge on individual droplets or the charge-to-mass ratio of water sprays needs to be known. However, the parameters which control the charge applied to water and the charging rate have been unsolved theoretically for any charging mechanism. The existing theories for the induction-charged and air-atomising a liquid jet have been found to be inadequate. And there is no theory available for corona charging of the droplets produced with a pneumatic nozzle in order to predict the spray charge level or the spray charge-to-mass ratio. In view of this situation, mathematical models have been developed in this thesis for both the corona and induction charging mechanisms. During the development of the theories, it has been assumed that for corona charging, that the jet is disintegrated into droplets and the droplets are then charged; for induction charging, that the jet is first charged and the charged jet is then disintegrated into charged droplets. The Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, plays an important role in linking the individual droplet charge to the spray charge-to-mass ratio for both charging mechanisms. The developed theories are general models suitable for any liquid with both corona and induction charging. Theoretical calculations for the spray charge-to-mass ratio, individual droplet charge and the ratio of droplet charge to the Rayleigh charge limit have been presented for almost all of the influencing electrical and mechanical parameters such as applied voltage, air flowrate, liquid flowrate, liquid conductivity, liquid dielectric constant, nozzle dimensions, cylindrical electrode dimensions, and fluid parameters, for example, density, viscosity and surface tension. In the calculation for corona charging of droplets, the effect of the droplets on corona current and corona-onset voltage has been assessed for first time. The introduction of the Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, makes the assessment possible. Theoretical calculations for induction charging of liquid jets have shown that provided liquids have a conductivity value higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m, then they can be charged satisfactorily by the induction charging method. Among all of the influencing parameters, the electrical and mechanical parameters determine the charging rate and the water spray charge level. The suitability of employing these two charging mechanisms to dust suppression in coal mine has been evaluated based on the spray charge level, safety issues and the simplicity or otherwise of the equipment. The induction charging method was considered to have advantages over its corona charging counterpart, and has been chosen for charging the water sprays in the experiment program. Water has a conductivity of s = - 10 2 S/m, higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m. Based upon theoretical considerations, it is concluded that water is an appropriate liquid for corona charging, based on its dielectric constant, and for induction charging, based on its conductivity. In order to facilitate the testing of electrostatically charged water spray cloud parameters, a spray charger/collector was designed and constructed by others and a computerised data acquisition system has been employed. According to the theory developed for induction charging, the optimum length of the charging electrode has been analysed based upon the assumption that water jet is first charged and then the charged jet is disintegrated into charged droplets by the high pressure air. An experimental program examined the dependence of spray current upon four parameters: air flowrate, water flowrate, applied voltage and jet diameter. The experiments have shown that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle used in the experiment is able to impart a significant charge into the water sprays. The spray charge-to-mass ratio calculated based upon the measured spray current demonstrates the same characteristics as predicted by theory: increasing with air flowrate, decreasing with water flowrate, increasing with applied voltage to a peak value then decreasing with further increase in the voltage, and increasing with jet diameter. A successful interpretation of an important phenomenon in the inductioncharged air-atomising a water jet, that spray charge-to-mass ratio and spray current increase with air pressure (or air flowrate) and decrease with increasing water flowrate, has been achieved based on the theories developed in this thesis. This phenomenon occurs because increasing air flowrate and/or decreasing water flowrate leads to a higher velocity of jet flowing through the induction electrode. However, when water flowrate becomes very small, a decrease in spray current with increasing air pressure (or flowrate) may be caused both by jet breakup inside the electrode and by contraction of the jet. In order to verify the theory, a preliminary comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions employing a constant kic in the air-jet interaction coefficient a which was assumed to be 0. 7 has shown a general agreement. However, the value of kic appears to be related to jet diameter, air/water mass ratio and applied voltage. An empirical equation for kic has then been formulated based on the experimental data for the spray charge-to-mass ratio. Finally a comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions using the formulated kic shows an improved agreement. It is concluded that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle has a potential application in dust suppression in coal mines, as the voltage required to charge water sprays is only 1000 ~ 1200 volts, and that the theory developed for induction charging of water sprays can be used to guide laboratory investigations and design processes for dust suppression and other industrial applications which might employ the electrostatic charging of liquid sprays...|$|R
