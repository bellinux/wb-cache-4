40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{northern}} Ligurian margin, at the geological junction of the subalpine domain and the Ligurian oceanic basin, in order (1) to identify {{the location of the}} southern limit of the Alpine compressive domain during the Cenozoic, and (2) to study the influence of a compressive environment on the tectonic and sedimentary evolution of a passive margin. Based on published onshore and offshore data, we first propose a chronology of the main extensional and compressional regional tectonic events. High-resolution seismic data image the margin structure down to similar to 3 km below seafloor. These data support that past rifting processes control the present-day margin structure, and that 2800 - 4000 m of synrift sediment was deposited on this segment of the margin in two steps. First, sub-parallel reflectors indicate sediment deposition within a <b>subsident</b> <b>basin</b> showing a low amount of extension. Then, a fan-shaped sequence indicates block tilting and a higher amount of extension. We do not show any influence of the Miocene Alpine compression on the present-day margin structure at our scale of investigation, despite the southern subalpine relief formed in the close hinterland at that time. The southern front of the Miocene Alps was thus located upslope from the continental margin. Finally, a comparison with the Gulf of Lions margin suggests that the tectonic influence of the Alpine compression on the rifting processes is restrited to an increase of the subsidence related to flexure ahead of the Alpine front, explaining abnormally high synrift thicknesses in the study area. The Alpine environment, however, has probably controlled the sedimentary evolution of the margin since the rifting. Indeed, sediment supply and distribution would be mainly controlled by the permanent building of relief in the hinterland and by the steep basin morphology, rather than by sea-level fluctuations, even during the Messinian sea-level low-stand...|$|E
40|$|The Danube River Basin and the Black Sea {{represent}} a unique natural laboratory for studying source to sink and global change. We will address {{information on the}} “active sink” of the system, which represents the area of active deposition: sea level variation, sediment balance, and neotectonics. Also, we will discuss the evolution and quantification of climate, tectonics, and eustasy on the sedimentation in the western Black Sea basin, along both southern and northern margins, obtained from understanding the Danube deep-sea fan processes and sedimentation. In the last decade, many of the geosciences studies {{carried out in the}} Black Sea have focused on the Holocene marine transgression. This topic has been fully discussed and is still a matter of debate. Since the DSDP drillings, the lithology and mineralogy of deep sediments from the Black Sea have been well studied. However, only few recent studies have focused on the deep-sea morphology and turbidite sedimentation in the western Black Sea basin, in which the main depositional feature is the Danube submarine fan. Oceanographic surveys in the Black Sea in 1998, 2002, and 2004 carried out in the framework of French-Romanian joint project and the European ASSEM-BLAGE (EVK 3 -CT- 2002 - 00090) project have collected a large amount of data (Multibeam echo sounder data, CHIRP seismic, as well as Kullenberg and Calypso cores). This paper presents insights from recent coring and seismic data recovered at the boundary of influence of both the distal part of the Danube turbiditic system and the Turkish margin. This data set provides a good record of changes in the sedimentary supply and climatic changes in the surrounding Black Sea since the last 25 ka. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the deep basin deposits bear the record of the late Quaternary paleoenvironmental changes. Finally, the western Black Sea basin constitutes an asymmetric <b>subsident</b> <b>basin</b> bordered by a northern passive margin containing confined mid-size, mud-rich turbiditic systems, and a tectonically active southern turbiditic ramp margin...|$|E
40|$|This study {{interprets the}} stratigraphic {{evolution}} of the mid-Cretaceous Urgonian Carbonate Platform sensu lato exposed in the northwestern Subalpine Chains of southeast France within a framework of dynamic environmental and climatic changes including relative sea-level fluctuations. Macroscopic observations of stratal geometries, especially stratal packaging within the succession revealed by differential weathering patterns have been integrated with the petrographic examination of limestone samples {{to assist in the}} interpretation of the carbonate succession. Seven hundred and twenty-eight rock samples were examined under the microscope as either thin sections or acetate peels and twenty five component parameters were used to define sediment composition within the data set. New and emerging analytical techniques have been used to interpret these data rather than the more traditional static fixed facies belts. Sequence stratigraphic concepts have been used to interpret platform evolution within the context of relative sea-level changes. In order to define microfacies and identify underlying environmental gradients computer optimized Jaccard's similarity coefficients matrices have been calculated between samples and component parameters using two computer programs SedUtil and JaccMat run on an IBM compatible Pentium personal computer. Computer optimized Jaccard's similarity coefficients similarity matrices are able to model both gradational and abrupt changes in facies composition in response to palaeogeographic and stratigraphic controls. Computer optimized similarity matrices between limestone compositional parameters from a series of logs show differences in the spatial and temporal nature of variations in sediment composition in response to environmental changes across the platform. The contrasts between the configurations of optimized similarity matrices are interpreted as indicating a palaeogeography {{at the beginning of the}} Urgonian characterised by a more strongly <b>subsident</b> <b>basin</b> to the southeast of the field area connected to the topographically-higher, tectonically more stable parts of the platform by low-angle slopes; the basin was eliminated by the end of the Urgonian. In addition optimized similarity matrices calculated between samples have been used to assist in defining eight-eight conventional microfacies assemblages which are described and illustrated using photomicrographs and pie-diagrams of modal composition. Despite the apparently conformable nature of the succession as observed in individual exposures, changes in the stratigraphy of the Urgonian platform sensu lata as traced along two southwest-northeast transects constructed through the Aravis and Bargy Chains indicate the existence of a low-angle distally steepened ramp topography at the top of the Hauterivian basement that sloped into a more strongly <b>subsident</b> <b>basin.</b> The Urgonian succession is divided into two third-order depositional sequences termed Depositional Sequence 1 and 2. In Depositional Sequence 1 all three systems tract are developed whereas Depositional Sequence 2 only contains transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The lowstand systems tract of Depositional Sequence 1 preserved in the southwest of the Aravis and Bargy Subalpine Chains is volumetrically significant, being dominated by hemipelagic deposits that shallow laterally to intertidal deposits to the northeast and also contain calciturbidites and two spectacular megabrecciahorizons. The two megabreccia horizons are interpreted as thin surficial collapse horizons formed by net extension on a very-low angle, previously kinematically stable slope, during fourth-fifth order relative sea-level falls. The lower sequence boundary of Depositional Sequence 1 passes laterally from being conformable in the southwest (deep-water basin) to being a major unconformity in the northeast ('inner' platform). However, this sequence boundary appears planar and concordantly bedded in the main and it is only in the northeastern Bargy Chain that it is observed as a erosional angular unconformity. The top of Depositional Sequence 1 is marked by the end of rudist lagoonal sediments and the deposition of beach facies which contain evidence of grain dissolution, overlain by Orbitolinidae foraminiferal rich horizons. By the top of Depositional Sequence 1 the low angle slope to the southwest had been totally subdued by sediment infilling and/or a decrease in the rate of differential subsidence. Depositional Sequence 1 was terminated by a comparatively minor relative sea-level fall followed by an immediate return to a major third-order relative sea-level rise and the basal transgressive deposits of Depositional 2. Depositional Sequence 2 re-establishes rudist sediment lagoonal deposition on the platform. It is often difficult to differentiate the transgressive and highstand systems tracts from one another in Depositional Sequence 2 and the boundary may be transitional. The upper sequence boundary of Depositional Sequence 2 is marked by a subaerial karst overlain by phosphatic greensands interpreted as reflecting a major relative sea-level fall and subsequent reflooding. Factors unique to carbonate depositional systems and their implications for the use of 'traditional' sequence stratigraphic models for carbonates are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Maestrat Basin {{was one of}} {{the most}} <b>subsident</b> <b>basins</b> of the Mesozoic Iberian Rift System. During the first stage of extensional {{activity}} (Late Permian-Late Triassic) a high angle normal fault system developed, which fragmented the Variscan basement into a system of horsts, grabens and half-grabens. Those faults were active during the deposition of the Buntsandstein facies and lasted until the lower part of the Middle Muschelkalk facies was deposited, filling the system of horsts and grabens and generating depositional thickness variations. The fault system was overstepped by the upper part of the Middle Muschelkalk, indicating a decrease in the extensional activity that lasted until the carbonates of the Upper Muschelkalk facies were deposited, as they present nearly constant thickness. During the Keuper facies deposition, the extensional activity of some normal faults in the acoustic basement resumed, triggering the Middle Muschelkalk salt flow, which developed salt anticlines and welds, increasing the depositional thickness variations of this facies. The age of the salt flow is deduced from the Keuper facies reflectors lapping on the folded Upper Muschelkalk above the salt accumulations. Growth-strata above some Upper Muschelkalk forced folds are also recognized, developed above some reactivated normal faults in the basement...|$|R
40|$|The Maestrat basin {{was one of}} {{the most}} <b>subsident</b> <b>basins</b> of the Iberian Rift system during the Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous, {{generated}} by a normal fault system which divided it into sub-basins. The E-W-trending, N-verging Maestrat Basement Thrust developed during its Cenozoic inversion, traversing the entire basin, as a result of the inversion of the Mesozoic fault system within the basement. As this thrust reached the Mesozoic cover, it propagated across the Middle Muschelkalk detachment level, transporting the supra-salt cover, and the normal fault segments within it, about 11 - 13 km towards the North. The basement thrust is deduced to have a ramp-flat geometry, with a low dip ramp which reaches 8 km depth, rooted in the upper crust. The displacement of the basement in the hanging wall of this ramp generated a 40 km-wide uplifted area, in the N-S direction, bounded to the N by the Calders monocline, interpreted as a fault-bend-fold adapted to the ramp to flat transition in the basement thrust. It also indicates the transition from a thick-skinned style of deformation in the S, to a thin-skinned style to the N. The superficial shortening accumulated in the northern margin of the basin, containing the thinnest Mesozoic cover, developing the Portalrubio- Vandellòs fold-and-thrust belt...|$|R
