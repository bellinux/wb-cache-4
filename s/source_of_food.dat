5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part of {{an unusual}} and highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for {{fish and other}} aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for humans in poor arid regions the crop {{can also be used}} as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{are a very}} {{important}} species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human–animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, {{the implementation of the}} Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for the natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute {{were sent to the}} Yakama Indian Reservation, and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Prey (known as Alien Prey in some markets) is a 1977 British {{independent}} {{science fiction}} horror film produced by Terry Marcel {{and directed by}} Norman J. Warren. The plot concerns a carnivorous alien (Barry Stokes) landing on Earth and befriending a lesbian couple (Glory Annen and Sally Faulkner) {{as part of his}} mission to evaluate humans as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> It was filmed in under two weeks on a budget of less than £60,000 in various locations near Shepperton Studios in Surrey. It had a limited distribution on release.|$|E

5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but {{the technique is}} not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E
5|$|The banana {{industry}} sustained severe losses, {{with trees}} downed and fruit damaged and numerous livestock drowned in flood waters. Initial assessments of agricultural losses {{from the storm}} reached $300million (JMD; US$3.4 million). Residents requested the government for immediate assistance as families were without a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and income. Official assessments in four parishes placed the damage to agriculture and livestock at $88.4million (JMD; US$1 million), with roughly $73.5million (JMD; US$835,000) of this accounting for 750 farmers in Saint Elizabeth.|$|E

5000|$|Hunting {{and fishing}} {{were the primary}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for the Inuit people, and men were {{traditionally}} responsible for these duties. Women's duties included gathering other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> such as eggs and berries, and preparing the food the hunters brought back. Seals, walrus, whales and caribou were the most common targets of Inuit hunters. Animals killed by the hunters needed to be butchered and frozen quickly, before they went bad or froze before being butchered. Women were traditionally responsible for the butchering, skinning, and cooking of animals taken by the hunters.|$|R
