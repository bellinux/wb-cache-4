40|$|This study {{examined}} land tenure systems, farm sizes, agricultural productivity and innovation in Imo State, Nigeria. Specifically the {{study examined}} the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, estimated the farm size of the farmers, identified reasons for not practicing mechanized farming, identified different innovations available to the farmers and identified the factors that affected agricultural productivity. Five communities were chosen randomly and from each of these communities, twenty farmers were randomly chosen. Data were collected, collated and analyzed using relevant techniques such as means, percentages, frequency distribution and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that 85 % of the respondents practiced individual land tenure system alone. It was also revealed that the laws of inheritance and increase in population led to the subdivision and fragmentation of existing farmland {{in such a manner}} that the sizes of farm holdings discouraged agricultural commercialization. Also, it was found that fragmentation led to a great distance between the plot which increased the waste in man-hour and energy. It was also shown that mechanization of agriculture was impracticable under land fragmentation and adoption of modern innovation was reduced since just 35. 0 % of the respondents claimed to have adopted other forms of innovation. Lastly, the null hypothesis was rejected concluding that socio-economic factors affected the farmer’s productivity in the area. It was recommended that formation of cooperatives by farmers is an imperative in farm land consolidation of the <b>scattered</b> <b>farm</b> <b>holdings</b> into economic size to encourage large scale operation and bulk input sourcing and procurement. land Tenure system, farm size, Agricultural productivity, innovation, Productivity Analysis,...|$|E

25|$|Agriculture dominates {{land use}} {{although}} there are areas of forestry and horticulture. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 <b>farm</b> <b>holdings</b> on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all <b>farm</b> <b>holdings</b> in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was {{much higher than the}} national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawatu, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.|$|R

40|$|Like {{the former}} member States of the EU in 1962 at the {{beginning}} of the CAP, today Romania focuses mainly on the restructuring and the modernisation of its agriculture. In a general context in which OECD advocates the targeting of <b>farm</b> <b>holdings</b> to achieve a better efficiency of agricultural policies, we analyse in this paper the difficulties for a definition for targeting the units in the Romanian context. The article draws parallels between different types of production structures in Romania, as they can be defined with the current statistical apparatus, and the objectives aimed by the principal measures of the rural development policy. It concludes with an analysis of the adequacy of the system chosen in Romania to accompany the modernisation, the restructuring and the reorientation of <b>farm</b> <b>holdings...</b>|$|R
