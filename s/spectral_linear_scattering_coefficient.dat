40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{issues related}} to the development of reconstructed tomography based on scattered X-ray radiation. For most X-ray tomography, based on collimated initial and scattered radiation, the distribution of the object density (<b>linear</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient)</b> is reconstructed by the number of counted photons scattered in the reconstructed voxel (volumetric pixel) where density distribution is received only visually and not numerically. Heterogeneous structures along the initial path and trajectory of counted scattered photons cause significant errors in imaging. Collimation of the initial and scattered radiation allows the detection of relatively few scattered photons, and this is the reason why the statistics relative to this process are very poor. The paper presents mathematical algorithms that improve images resulting from this type of tomography and demonstrates that the imaging based on scattered collimated radiation does not provide the quality of resolution comparable to conventional transmission tomography. One approach to generate high-quality scattering tomography at high resolution is the use of a large non-collimated detector. This allows counting almost all of the scattered photons leaving the object {{in the direction of the}} detector. It provides the opportunity to reconstruct the <b>linear</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> distribution numerically. The combined use of transmission and scattering tomography present the opportunity to identify an effective atomic number and density distribution...|$|R

40|$|An {{updating}} of photon transport modelling in tissues {{is carried}} out by including the effect of molecular interference in the coherent (Rayleigh) scattering. To this end, the present tabulations-which permit us to obtain the <b>linear</b> differential <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> of compounds from a simple weighted sum of the elemental components-are integrated by adding files for a limited set of molecular interference functions. This set originates from a four-component model which {{is found to be}} capable of reproducing human tissues in situations involving bony and soft tissues.

40|$|In {{this work}} small angle {{coherent}} scattering data are presented for some biological tissues. The effect of low angle diffusion on the micro-beams dose distributions are assessed {{by means of}} a dedicated version of the EGS 4 code. The atomic form factor tabulations were upgraded in EGS 4 to include experimental values of compounds instead of obtaining the <b>linear</b> differential <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> from a simple weighted sum of the elemental components. In this manner, one includes the effects induced by both the large-scale arrangement of the sample structure and the molecular interference. It is shown that the inclusion of the measured form factors and cross-sections in the photon transport calculations induce not negligible effects in the dose deposited around the microbeams. The fact of not taking into account small angle scattering cross-sections may lead to underestimating the number of scattered photons reaching zones not directly illuminated.

40|$|In the {{experimental}} study of the spectral distribution of x-radiation scattered by light elements it has always, up to the present, been assumed that multiple scattering could be neglected. Recent improvements in experimental technique however {{make it possible to}} suppose that multiple (especially double) scattering may now be detectable from large scattering bodies. Multiple scattering may (1) affect the breadth of the modified line, (2) change the structure of the modified line, (3) distort the background {{in such a way as}} to render measurements of shift unreliable. It is therefore valuable to analyze the effect of multiple scattering in case some of the recent mutually discordant experimental results may be explained and harmonized in this way. Assuming initially monochromatic radiation, scattering of any degree of multiplicity contributes a spectral band whose wave-length limits are here determined and discussed. The Breit, Compton, Jauncey formula taking polarization into account is adopted for the purposes of calculation of modified intensity. The results are thus fairly accurate for hard radiation scattered from very light elements. For softer radiation modified scattering at small scattering angles is greatly reduced below the values given by the Breit, Compton, Jauncey formula and unmodified scattering appears. The effect of this on the results of this paper is discussed in a qualitative way. The case of double scattering from a spherical scatterer is computed in complete detail and a formula for the ratio of double to single scattering is derived. Curves of the spectral distributions due to double scattering are shown. The dependence of the total doubly scattered intensity on the primary scattering angle is plotted. The natural width of the modified line is neglected throughout these calculations. Absorption in the scatterer is also neglected. The ratio of double to single scattering for a spherical scatterer observed under any given angle is proportional to the radius of the scatterer (neglecting absorption) and is given by Doubly scattered energy /Singly scattered energy = 9 / 32 σrR(θ) where σ is the <b>linear</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the material of the scattering sphere, r the radius of the sphere, θ the angle under which single scattering occurs. R(θ) never differs greatly from 2. 5. Triple scattering is negligible in comparison to single scattering. Twice modified doubly scattered radiation may contribute a faint asymmetric line or edge at the shifted position Δλ= 2 (h/mc) (1 +cos 1 / 2 θ) For hard radiation when the Thompson formula (with Breit correction) applies with fair accuracy to modified scattering alone twice modified doubly scattered radiation contributes a spectral band of breadth 4 (h/mc) cos 1 / 2 θ Once modified doubly scattered radiation may cause a slight broadening of the Compton line except in regions near θ= 0 and θ= 180 °...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{periodic}} {{structure is}} common used in engineering {{to improve the}} sound diffusion in room acoustics. It usually has large dimensions {{and it is difficult}} to calculate the <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> based on its original scale. In order to represent the <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> of a large scale periodic structure by those of a smaller one, the relations of the <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the periodic structures with different dimensions are analyzed in this paper. At first, a BMM (Boundary Meshless Method) for calculating the <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> is derived. The <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the periodic structures which have different numbers of sub-structures are calculated and compared. The computation results of different sub-structure numbers show that the periodic structure with 15 sub-structures can represent the samples which have more sub-structures. In addition, it can be proved that the square samples can be represented by those of the small and rectangular ones which have the same numbers of sub-periods. These conclusions not only greatly enhance the computational efficiency, but also show good prospect for fast evaluation of the periodic structures in engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of {{ultrasound}} modulation of near infrared (NIR) light on the quantification of <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> in tissue-mimicking biological phantoms. Methods: A unique method to estimate the phase of the modulated NIR light making use of only time averaged intensity measurements using a charge coupled device camera is used in this investigation. These experimental measurements from tissue-mimicking biological phantoms are used to estimate the differential pathlength, in turn leading to estimation of optical <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A Monte-Carlo model base numerical estimation of phase in lieu of ultrasound modulation is performed to verify the experimental results. Results: The {{results indicate that the}} ultrasound modulation of NIR light enhances the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The observed effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient</b> enhancement in tissue-mimicking viscoelastic phantoms increases with increasing ultrasound drive voltage. The same trend is noticed as the ultrasound modulation frequency approaches the natural vibration frequency of the phantom material. The contrast enhancement is less for the stiffer (larger storage modulus) tissue, mimicking tumor necrotic core, compared to the normal tissue. Conclusions: The ultrasound modulation of the insonified region leads to an increase in the effective number of scattering events experienced by NIR light, increasing the measured phase, causing the enhancement in the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The ultrasound modulation of NIR light could provide better estimation of <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The observed local enhancement of the effective <b>scattering</b> <b>coefficient,</b> in the ultrasound focal region, is validated using both experimental measurements and Monte-Carlo simulations.
