50|$|The {{guira cuckoo}} is arboreal, but can {{frequently}} {{be seen on}} the ground, usually in flocks of 6 to 18 individuals. It is sometimes seen with other birds such as the <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> (Crotophaga ani) whose behaviour is similar.|$|E
40|$|Information on {{the role}} of <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>anis</b> (Crotophaga ani) as tick-pickers on mammals remains controversial. I record here these birds {{removing}} ticks and pecking at wounds of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) in a small reserve at Campinas, São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The birds inspected the mammals' skin, both in places with and without hair. The hair was parted with bill movements, and ticks were removed by vigorous pulling. The birds also pecked at open or healing sores, from which they extracted small portions of blood clots and dead tissue. The capybaras appeared oblivious to the birds' activity. Even in the case that the cleaning behaviour is restricted to some bird individuals and populations, or places and periods, this record validates the notion that <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>anis</b> removes ticks from herbivorous mammals...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{aggressive}} and will defend rich food sources from other nectarivores; {{due to its}} size, it is generally dominant over other species of hummingbirds. Even much larger birds are attacked by diving at them when they perch; particularly when breeding the swallow-tailed hummingbird will go and [...] "dive-bomb" [...] birds twice its own length or more, such as Campo flickers (Colaptes campestris), curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) or <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>anis</b> (Crotophaga ani), until they have enough and leave. Disturbed by much larger birds such as Guira cuckoos (Guira guira) or hawks, it will usually just give warning calls, but a female swallow-tailed hummingbird has been observed to attack a Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsonii) [...] weighing {{more than a hundred}} times as much as the hummingbird [...] in mid-air. Warning calls are also given at mammalian carnivores and humans, though in urban environment this hummingbird may tolerate human observers for prolonged time, even when nesting, if they keep a distance of 10 meters or so.|$|R
50|$|Four species {{make up the}} subfamily, {{namely the}} guira cuckoo (Guira guira) and the {{three members of the}} genus Crotophaga known as anis. Study of the cranial {{osteology}} and mitochondrial DNA yield the same phylogeny, namely that the <b>Smooth-billed</b> and groove-billed <b>ani</b> are each other's closest relatives, with the greater ani related and the guira cuckoo an earlier offshoot of the group.|$|R
50|$|The <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> (Crotophaga ani) {{is a large}} near {{passerine}} bird in the cuckoo family. It is {{a resident}} breeding species from southern Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, parts of Central America, south to western Ecuador, Brazil, and northern Argentina.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a very}} gregarious species, {{always found}} in noisy groups. The calls include a whining ooo-leeek. The <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> feeds on termites, large insects and even lizards and frogs. They will {{occasionally}} remove ticks and other parasites from grazing animals.|$|E
50|$|Among the anis, {{there is}} {{considerable}} variation in nesting habits. One species, The greater ani C. major lays 2 or 3 eggs, while the groove-billed ani C. sulcirostris lays seven. However the <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> C. ani will share one nest between several females, with up to 29 eggs in one nest. Incubation takes 15 days for this species.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillar}} {{has several}} antipredator adaptations. Its consumption of toxic plants makes it distasteful to most predators. An {{exception is the}} <b>Smooth-billed</b> <b>Ani</b> (Crotophaga ani), which tears the caterpillar apart to eat it, avoiding the gut containing the plant material. The caterpillar is also coated in barbed urticating hairs, which stick deeply in skin and cause irritation. If caught, the caterpillar bites.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{found on}} Andros include the loggerhead kingbird, La Sagra's flycatcher, Cuban pewee, Bahama mockingbird, red-legged thrush, thick-billed vireo, black-whiskered vireo, olive-capped warbler, Greater Antillean bullfinch, black-faced grassquit, melodious grassquit, least grebe, olivaceous cormorant, American flamingo, Bahama pintail, osprey, American kestrel, sooty tern, roseate tern, noddy tern, white-crowned pigeon, zenaida dove, Caribbean dove, <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> and Cuban emerald hummingbird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani</b> is a mid-sized species, larger {{on average}} than the groove-billed ani but {{smaller than the}} greater ani. It {{measures}} 30 - 36 cm in length and weighs 71 - 133 g. The adult is mainly flat black, with a long tail, deep ridged black bill and a brown iris. The flight is weak and wobbly, but the bird runs well and usually feeds on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The medium tree finch is {{threatened}} by introduced predators such as rats, mice, cats, and the <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani,</b> as well as habitat loss, which has occurred through clearance for agriculture. The introduced fly Philornis downsi is a significant threat {{to the survival of}} this species. Parasitic larvae of this fly live in the nest material and feed on the blood and body tissues of nestlings. P. downsi causes high nestling mortality in the medium tree finch. Because of this, and because it has a very small range on a single island, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the medium tree finch as [...] "critically endangered".|$|E
50|$|The groove-billed ani {{is about}} 34 cm long, and weighs 70 - 90 g. It is {{completely}} black, {{with a very}} long tail {{almost as long as}} its body. It has a huge bill with horizontal grooves {{along the length of the}} upper mandible. It is very similar to the <b>smooth-billed</b> <b>ani,</b> some of which have bills as small as the groove-billed and with grooves on the basal half. The two species are best distinguished by voice and range. In flight, the ani alternates between quick, choppy flaps and short glides.Like other anis, the groove-billed is found in open and partly open country, such as pastures, savanna, and orchards. It feeds largely on a mixed diet of insects, seeds, and fruits.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Smooth-billed</b> <b>Ani</b> Crotophaga ani was {{introduced}} to the Galapagos archipelago in the 1960 s, since when its population has grown signiﬁcantly. We studied the dietary items in the gizzards of 56 anis sampled on the island of Santa Cruz. We conﬁrmed that the diet of C. ani consists primarily of invertebrates and plant material, including native species and non-native invasives. The second most abundant seed in the anis’ diet was that of the highly invasive plant, Rubus niveus. Our ﬁndings suggest that C. ani poses a threat to the Galapagos ecosystem by dispersing seeds of non-native plants and by competing with other insectivorous species on the islands. Furthermore, the discovery of a Darwin’s Finch nestling in the gizzard of one C. ani establishes direct predation by this species on native birds...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} the <b>Smooth-billed</b> <b>Ani</b> (a type of bird in the cuckoo family 1) is a myth told by the Trumai people of the central region of Brazil. It was video {{recorded}} in 2000 by the author (Raquel Guirardello-Damian) and narrated by Kumaru Trumai, a middle-aged woman who has since died. She learned it from her father, Ɨnɨtɨarɨ, a great and respected storyteller. The myth was later transcribed and analyzed {{with the assistance of}} a young man, Tarukuy, who is bilingual in Trumai and Portuguese. The text is presented in its phonological form with IPA symbols, followed by English glosses and free translation. This dataset contains the mediafiles. A glossed version with annotations is found in On this and other worlds [...] Voices from Amazonia Edited by Kristine Stenzel and Bruna Franchett...|$|E
40|$|Living {{closely with}} others {{can provide a}} myriad of fitness benefits, from shared {{territory}} defense to co-operative resource acquisition. Costs of social aggregation are not absent, however, and likely influence optimal and observed groups' sizes in a social species. Here, we explored optimal group size in a joint-nesting cuckoo species (the <b>Smooth-billed</b> <b>Ani,</b> Crotophaga ani) using endocrine markers of stress physiology (corticosterone, or CORT). Smooth-billed Anis exhibit intense reproductive competition that is exacerbated in atypically large groups. We therefore hypothesized that intra-group competition (measured by social group size) mediates the desirability and physiological cost of social group membership in this species. To test this hypothesis, we captured 47 adult Smooth-billed Anis (31 males, 16 females) during the breeding seasons of 2012 - 2014 in south-western Puerto Rico, and documented social group sizes. Tail feathers were sampled and used to quantify CORT (pg/mg) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (n = 50). Our analyses show significant differences in feather-CORT of adults between categorical group sizes, with individuals from atypically large social groups (≥ x + 1 SD) having highest mean concentrations (33. 319 pg/mg), and individuals from atypically small social groups (≤ x - 1 SD) having lowest mean concentrations (8. 969 pg/mg). Whether reproductive competition or effort is responsible for elevated CORT in atypically large social groups, however, remains unclear. Our results suggest that living in atypically large groups is physiologically expensive and may represent an evolutionarily unstable strategy. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to explore a correlation between stress physiology and group size in a joint-nesting species...|$|E
