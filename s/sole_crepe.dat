50|$|Brothel creepers (sometimes {{shortened}} to creepers) are a {{style of}} shoe which has thick <b>crepe</b> <b>soles,</b> often in combination with suede uppers. This style of footwear became fashionable {{in the years following}} World War II, seeing resurgences of popularity at various times ever since.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a predictive model describing the slip resistance of various climbing surfaces. In a four-factor experiment, seven commonly used metal grating step surfaces were evaluated, along with four types of shoe <b>soles</b> (<b>crepe,</b> leather, ribbed-rubber, and oil-resistant-rubber); three contaminant conditions (dry, wet-water, and diesel fuel); and direction of force application. The results showed that the available slip resistance coefficients (ASRC) varied primarily as a function of sole material and contaminants. This result and the significant interactions between sole and step surfaces suggest that the appropriate selection of shoe soles and control of contaminants may be the most effective way of attaining adequate ASRC values. A predictive equation was developed using multiple regression which described the evaluated conditions with binary indicator variables. To increase the equation's applicability, the step surfaces were described in terms of generic features such as: painted vs. bare metal surface; ring vs. point protrusions; edge orientation; contact area, and protrusion height gradient. The equation explained 89 % of the variance in the original data. In a validation study, the equation explained 80 % of the variance in slip resistance for a new step surface under the original set of sole, contaminant, and directionality conditions...|$|R
50|$|Jute soles {{typically}} include fully or partially {{vulcanized rubber}} beneath the jute soles for long-lasting espadrille shoes. Sometimes <b>crepe</b> <b>soles</b> {{are used as}} out-soles although those are not as durable compared to vulcanized ones. Jute braid soles might include heels made of wood or EVA foam.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{best known}} product is the Desert Boot - a {{distinctive}} ankle height boot with <b>crepe</b> <b>sole</b> usually {{made out of}} calf suede leather traditionally supplied by Charles F Stead & Co tannery in Leeds. Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark).|$|R
50|$|Vehicle drivers wore boots without hobnails {{because they}} would damage the pedals and create sparks. This was {{extended}} to armored vehicle crews in the Royal Tank Regiment and Reconnaissance Corps in 1942, {{as well as to}} the crews of waterborne craft of the Royal Army Service Corps in 1943. Specialists and ammo storesmen were issued regular ammo boots with rubber heels and rubber <b>crepe</b> <b>soles</b> that lacked the hobnails and steel heel- and toe-plates. This was to avoid creating sparks near flammable or explosive stores (like gunpowder or gasoline). Commandos were issued them to make it easier for them to move silently.|$|R
50|$|On the French {{scene in}} 1970, Daniel Raufast {{came across a}} poster {{advertising}} the musical Hair. Interested by all the barefooted youngsters wearing jeans, he developed a new shoe concept which he believed to be more compatible with the blue-jean generation. The designer Jacques Chevallereau then created the first 'jean boot'. This new shoe was very different: the use of nubuck; shapes that looked more like short boots than regular shoes; tough <b>crepe</b> <b>soles</b> made with natural rubber, eyelets, contrast stitching, panels and appliqués all obviously referencing denim. The success was such that, within one season, Kickers production capacity grew from 300 to 12,000 pairs per month. Immediately successful in France, then Germany, by 1974, Kickers were selling in over 70 countries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{year was}} 1941, and the soldier, well he wasn't just any infantryman, he was Nathan Clark, and he'd {{been sent to}} war with two missions. First and {{foremost}} to protect his country, and, secondly, to discover some new shoe designs for his family's company. As {{a member of the}} Eighth Army, Clark had been deployed to Burma, and it was here that he noticed that the officers in his formation were wearing these strange, sand colored chukkas during their downtime. Clark investigated the shoes and learned that they had originally been commissioned to Cairo cobblers by South African soldiers whose old-military issue boots had failed them out on the desert terrain. They wanted something that was both lightweight and grippy which led to creation of a boot with a suede upper on a <b>crepe</b> <b>sole.</b> Jake Gallagher ...|$|R
5000|$|When bigger gatherings were banned, the Swing Kids {{moved to}} more {{informal}} settings, and swing clubs and discotheques emerged {{in all the}} major cities of the Reich. Participants were mainly from the upper middle class, as swing culture required the participants {{to have access to}} the music, which was not played on German radio, so that extensive collections of phonograph recordings were essential. Similarly, to understand the lyrics of the predominantly American songs, it was necessary to have at least a rudimentary understanding of English, which was not taught in the [...] (working-class high school). Relative wealth also fostered a distinctive style among the Swing Kids, which was in some ways comparable to the zoot suit style popular in the United States at the time. Boys usually wore long jackets, often checkered, shoes with <b>crepe</b> <b>soles</b> (for dancing), and flashy scarves. They almost always carried an umbrella, and added a dress shirt button with a semi-precious stone. Girls generally wore their hair long and loose and added excessive makeup. Their dandyish dress style riled the Nazis by drawing heavily on Hispanic Pachucos.|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} implies Fashion Crimes {{is a book}} that {{addresses}} the relationship between clothing and crime and or criminal behaviour. Initially, this might seem like a rather odd pairing; how can clothes be considered criminal? Surely, criminals don’t still wear hooped sweaters and carry bags labelled ‘swag’ {{as they did in}} early twentieth century movies? Yet, clothes and criminality are well ensconced into our everyday language, i. e. the recent fashion trend for ‘brothel creeper’ shoes worn by Teddy Boys in the 1950 s, clearly linguistically and visually link soft <b>crepe</b> <b>soles</b> with illicit behaviour that needs to be hidden or kept quiet. Likewise, hoods and capes conceal identity, whilst simultaneously simulating the excitement of the mask, or the potential thrill of the reveal. In these examples, the need for anonymity is paramount, part of the performance even, and clothes become props or costumes for behaviour/s that transcend mere body dressing or articulating concepts of the individual. Clothing becomes a metaphor that goes beyond the personal, speaking of something that goes beyond words. The relationship between clothing and behaviour as a site of social acceptance or rejection has long been discussed by fashion theorists, particularly those adopting an anthropological approach to dress and its wearing. Likewise, notions of clothing as means of materialising the psyche or emotional self have been addressed by fashion theorists adopting a psychoanalytical model. These established discourses rarely overlap, and one might conclude that the fusion of the personal, the social and the institutional offers a site for an investigation into the way clothing is recognised, used and worn, as expressions of wider socio-cultural and political concerns in contemporary everyday life. <br/...|$|R
