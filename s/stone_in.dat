40|$|Background/Objectives: Considering the {{different}} renal manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we carried out {{this study to}} investigate the prevalence of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> patients with RA compared to general population. Patients and Methods: From January 2000 to March 2001, 74 patients with RA and 58 healthy individuals as the control group were evaluated for kidney stones with sonography. All patients were diagnosed {{on the basis of}} 1987 criteria of American College of Rheumatology (ACR). 1 Results: In the group of patients with RA, 6 out of 74 subjects (8. 1 %) had renal stones. The prevalence of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the control group was 8. 6 % (5 out of 58 persons). The difference in the incidence of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the two groups was not statistically significant. The size of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the two groups was not significantly different. We did not find any relationship between the duration of RA or its various symptoms and the incidence of renal stones. Conclusion: Although RA involves kidneys and in previous studies it was mentioned that the incidence of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> the patients with RA is higher than general population, we did not find any significant statistical correlation between RA and the incidence of renal <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> our study...|$|R

5|$|The {{first half}} of the anime's plot follows that of the manga, but the plots {{severely}} diverge from each other near the middle of the story. After Kimblee uses alchemy to transform Al's armor into explosive material, Scar transfers all of his incomplete Philosopher's Stone into Al to save his life. As a result, Alphonse's armor becomes the Philosopher's Stone. Because he houses the <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> his body, he becomes the primary target of the homunculi's leader Dante, who is trying to cheat death. Once captured by the homunculi for Dante, Al is to be eaten by Gluttony to complete the Stone inside Gluttony's body. But when he sees his brother killed trying to save him, Al uses the stone's power to heal Edward's body and re-bind his soul to it. This destroys Al's own body as he uses up the whole of the Philosopher's <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> the transmutations. Then Edward, using his own body, resurrects Alphonse. As a result, Edward disappears and Alphonse continues studying alchemy to find him.|$|E
