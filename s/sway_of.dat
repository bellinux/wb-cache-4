5|$|Its {{dimensions}} are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably {{influenced by the}} geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on the lower half.|$|E
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under the <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> Rome.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E

40|$|The "freezing {{rotation}} illusion" {{refers to}} decrease in perceived {{speed of a}} continuously rotating central region when a swaying surround co-rotates. We observed the following effects for rotations: First, when the centre and its surround are turning in the same direction, and their velocities are distinguishable, the perceived speed of the centre is lower than its physical speed. Second, when the surround and the centre are counter-rotating, the perceived speed of the centre is enhanced. Third, even when the surface size of the centre matches the surface size <b>of</b> the surround, <b>swaying</b> <b>of</b> the centre is unable to induce {{significant changes in the}} perceived speed of the surround, whereas <b>swaying</b> <b>of</b> the surround still induces changes in the perceived speed of the centre...|$|R

25|$|Following this period, {{the region}} of Mesopotamia seems to have come under the <b>sway</b> <b>of</b> a Sumerian conqueror from Adab, Lugal-Ane-mundu, ruling over Uruk, Ur, and Lagash.

25|$|This {{fact and}} the extent of his conquest are known from his inscriptions. Towards the end of his reign, or before his death, the Rashtrakutas under Krishna III invaded the Tamil Country, killed the Chola prince Rajaditya at Takkolam (near Arakkonam) in c.

25|$|In the 3rd century AD, the Goths {{arrived in}} the lands of Ukraine around 250–375AD, which they called Oium, {{corresponding}} to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture.

North of the Ostrogothic kingdom was the Kiev culture, flourishing from the 2nd–5th centuries, when it was overrun by the Huns.

When Ericourt describes how the rhythm should be played in these pieces, he writes, [...] "First, the rhythm is to be steady, with even beats throughout, {{but at the same}} time, give a supple and relaxed, even languid or voluptuous impression. The 'marcato' indication at the beginning means exactness, rather than a rigidity of rhythm. The music must flow uninterruptedly." [...] Ericourt also emphasizes the importance of moderation in expression: [...] "Any exaggeration, tonal or otherwise, could easily bring vulgarity to this composition." ...|$|R
40|$|Balance {{system is}} one of {{important}} body system that enables us to perform our daily activities such as walking, running and standing without any difficulties. Gans Sensory Organization Performance (SOP) Test {{is one of}} the simple and cost-effective tools to evaluate the body balance status. In this test, there are seven conditions that are important for the evaluation of the ability to utilize and integrate sensory input for postural control. This preliminary study was performed to determine the normative value for Gans Sensory Organization Performance Test using Bal Ex Foam among normal adult. We recruited 47 normal subjects among health sciences student and staff. All subjects completed the MVSS questionnaire and GAN SOP test using BAL EX foam. Assessment of starting time <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> and degree <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> in condition 1 to condition 6. In condition 7, the participants will be assessed only in the degree <b>of</b> <b>swaying.</b> Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in age, gender, weight and height with the results of starting time <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> and degree <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> in condition 1 to condition 6. Besides, there is also no relationship between age, weight, and height with the degree <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> in condition 7. Hence, this test can be used in clinical setting regardless of age, gender, weight, and height. The results also showed there is no relationship between age, gender, weight, and height with starting time <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> and degree <b>of</b> <b>swaying</b> when standing on BAL EX Foam with eyes closed. In conclusion, BAL EX Foam is one of an alternative foam since it shows no effect in term of different age, weight, height, and gende...|$|R
