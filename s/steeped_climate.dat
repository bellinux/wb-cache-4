40|$|With {{homogeneous}} bedrock, dramatic rainfall gradients, and remnant surfaces that constrain their age, initial topography, {{and vertical}} motions relative to sea level, volcanic ocean islands provide an exceptional natural experiment in landscape evolution. Analyses traversing gradients in island climate and bedrock age {{have the potential}} to advance our understanding of landscape evolution in a diverse range of continental settings. Yet, islands are initially conic, net subsiding, boundary-dominated, and initially permeable landmasses, in many ways dissimilar to most continental landscapes. This thesis examines unique aspects of island landscape evolution, and it exploits <b>steep</b> <b>climate</b> gradients and variations in bedrock age on volcanic ocean islands to understand controls on rates and patterns of erosion and the contribution of lithosphere and mantle processes to surface deformation at hotspots. Through physically-based modeling, analysis of remote sensing and geochronologic data, and field measurements, this thesis examines (1) the dominant mechanisms of vertical motion in the Hawaiian Islands, (2) the influence of wave power on cliff retreat rates in the Hawaiian Island over geologic timescales, (3) the control of rainfall rates on the efficiency of bedrock river incision on the Hawaiian Island of Kaua'i, (4) the evolution of erosion rates over the course of landscape development on Kaua'i and other volcanic ocean islands, and (5) the mechanisms that cause volcanic ocean islands to ultimately subside below sea level to form atolls and guyots. These analyses provide empirical evidence for climatic control on erosion processes and they constrain the dynamics of plume-plate interactions at oceanic hotspots. by Kimberly Lynn Huppert.

40|$|AbstractThe {{regional}} {{climate of}} Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, eastern Indonesia is simulated for 130 years (1971 – 2100) for the SRES A 2 Delayed Development or ‘Business as Usual’ emissions scenario using the CSIRO conformal-cubic atmospheric model (CCAM). Regional climate simulations are generated using a multiple downscaling technique where a CCAM 200 km uniform-grid global simulation {{is driven by}} bias-corrected sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from host coupled Global Climate Models (GCMs). Next, the 200 km resolution CCAM simulations are dynamically downscaled to 14 km resolution for the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa. To provide an ensemble of results, separate simulations are performed from six host GCMs. The present-day model results are validated against available observations. Generally, the CCAM 14 km resolution simulations produce rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures {{that are similar to}} the observations. However, the 14 km simulations have rainfall biases of around 5 mm/day in the wet December–February season and lesser biases in the other seasons. Climate projections are examined for two future time intervals centred on 2030 and 2060. The simulations of rainfall changes by 2060 suggest both increases and decreases of up to 5 % in December–February, with more acute declines of 10 % in some areas, and decreases of up to 10 % in March–May. For the other seasons, generally little change is simulated. The regional temperatures are projected to increase by about 1 °C by 2030 and 1. 6 – 2 °C by 2060. The high-resolution model outputs enable detailed differentiation between locations across the islands. Our results show that due to orographic effects there are <b>steep</b> <b>climate</b> gradients, resulting in significant local differences in climate projections. We discuss the challenges and implications of these results for adaptation planning...|$|R

This finding corroborates with the findings of Kassie et al. (2009) and Wossen et al. (2015). In the same line, a study by Asrat and Simane (2017 b) implied that farmers invest in adaptation measures in plots where they expect more risk from climate hazards.|$|R

40|$|Japan has {{experienced}} several catastrophic flood events causing extensive {{damage to property}} and the national economy due to its topography, geography, and <b>climate.</b> <b>Steep</b> and short rivers, frequent typhoons and torrential rains, extremely high concentration of people and assets in flood-prone areas, and intensive human intervention subject the country to frequent flood disasters. Risk Management Solutions (RMS) has developed a stochastic inland flood model {{as part of its}} Japan Typhoon Model to assess flood risk due to typhoon for the (re) insurance industry. The RMS flood risk model consists of i) a precipitation-driven flood hazard module, ii) a building-level exposure module, iii) a component-based vulnerability module and iv) a financial module. The flood model is driven by 105, 000 years of continuously simulated precipitation accounting for typhoon and non-typhoon precipitation. Rainfall-runoff and routing models, fluvial- and pluvial-inundation models, and probabilistic defence failures are included in the flood hazard module to obtain a realistic view of flood risk. By combining a large, country-level stochastic dataset with a high-resolution grid (~ 40 m) for flood inundation modeling, and building level exposure data and hundreds of unique component-based vulnerability types, a comprehensive view of flood risk is provided on both local and aggregate levels, The financial module accounts for insured risk from different financial contracts...|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} polarity stratigraphy {{is established}} for a continuously cored 360 m thick {{section of the}} entire cyclical lacustrine sequence {{and part of the}} sandy fluvial and eolian basal sequence of the Late Triassic Blomidon Formation in the Fundy basin in Nova Scotia (Canada). In conjunction with published results for the Newark and Dan River basins, the Fundy basin record allows us to precisely map the spatio-temporal distribution of climate-sensitive continental lithofacies along a paleolatitudinal transect in eastern North America corresponding to the tropics of Pangea in the Late Triassic. Indicators of high humidity such as coals and black shales tend to occur within 5 ° of the paleoequator and eolian dunes and other evidence of aridity occurs within 10 ° of the paleoequator. Although <b>steep,</b> the latitudinal <b>climate</b> gradient in the interior of the Pangea supercontinent is not that different from the average modern zonal variation in the balance of evaporation to precipitation even though the distribution of continents was radically different and {{there is no evidence of}} continental ice sheets in the Late Triassic. We suggest that the common perception of a dry paleoequator in the Triassic is largely an artifact of observational bias because compilations of paleoclimate proxies usually have spatio-temporal resolutions that are inadequate to delineate narrow zonal climate belts, giving an aliased impression of ancient climate...|$|R
40|$|While {{scholars}} {{debate the}} fairness {{and efficiency of}} full priority secured lending and asset securitization, lawmakers pass statutes that only expand these types of financing. Lawmakers seem compelled to err in favor of sophisticated secured creditors and against creditors in weak bargaining positions. This article addresses why non-adjusting creditors remain on the sidelines as lawmakers embrace legislation encouraging asset securitization and expanding UCC Article 9. It argues that non-adjusting creditors 2 ̆ 7 positions must be understood {{in relation to a}} socio-political <b>climate</b> <b>steeped</b> in deference to the needs of institutional creditors. Legal scholars have failed to take issues of broad socio-political climate into account in analyses of how and why the law continues to expand secured creditors 2 ̆ 7 domain. Contemporary media on finance and business evidence this socio-political climate. There is an acute lack of critical distance from financing activities that pervades journalism in the United States. This lack of critical distance in public discourse on finance is a form of disregard of economic inequality among Americans. This article hypothesizes that disregard of inequality in business reporting indicates an imagined community of investors with which even disadvantaged creditors identify. Widespread identification with an imagined community of investors enables secured creditors to present unfettered expansion of business credit as consonant with public interest both within the UCC drafting process and before the state legislatures...|$|R
40|$|Forest soils {{contribute}} to {{a significant portion of}} the world 2 ̆ 7 s carbon flux due to both natural and anthropogenic changes. In terms of human management of carbon pools, forest soil organic matter (SOM) is important because it potentially stores carbon more permanently than living vegetation. Yet, this potential is poorly understood or managed for because of the difficulty in measuring changes in SOM pools over time and space. Modeling combined with intensive field sampling can help overcome these limitations because it extracts from empirically observed relationships to account for the components of SOM formation (topography, time, parent material, organisms and climate[fns 2]). This study utilizes intensive field data, statistical models and process-based ecosystem models to investigate the spatial distribution and dynamics of soil organic carbon dynamics in two contrasting ecosystems—the northern hardwood forest in the Green Mountains, VT and the tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, PR. ^ In both forests landscape position emerged as the dominate factor in explaining SOM distribution. In Vermont, additional variation was explained by aspect and slope and in Puerto Rico additional variation was explained by landscape factors interrelated to soil drainage. Process-based modeling proved to be a useful management and experimental tool in cases were empirical approaches were impractical for both forests. In Vermont, three ecosystem models demonstrated a substantial reduction of soil organic carbon and harvestable biomass due to the removal of woody carbon by logging after 240 years of rotations. In Puerto Rico, the Century model showed that changes in litter quality and quantity were not likely responsible in explaining landscape level SOM differences. Overall, well drained soils located in colder climates stored the highest SOM whereas poorly drained and highly disturbed soils in <b>steep</b> humid <b>climates</b> stored the lowest SOM. This research demonstrates that although SOM amounts are highly variable over many spatial and temporal scales, intuitive relationships are borne out with modeling tools and by careful investigation of the five soil forming factors. Results also raise questions about how these ecosystems and their SOM pools may change in response to changing climate conditions of the future. ...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, non-allophanic Andosols {{are linked}} with Hercynian basic and metabasic rocks in {{smoothed}} highlands {{with a cool}} and humid climate. We describe an Andosol-Cambisol toposequence derived from Variscan coarse-grained granite in Northern Austria (Bohemian Massif), where Andosols have formed on plateaus and Cambisols on <b>steep</b> slopes. The <b>climate</b> is continental, cool and humid (mean annual temperature and rainfall: 5. 4 degreesC and 914 mm), with a 100 -day mean annual period of snow cover. The forest is dominated by beech and spruce trees. Both soils are rich in organic matter and strongly acidic, but the Andosol is more strongly weathered than the Cambisol. Below the 15 -cm-thick litter in the Andosol, the 38 -cm-thick AB-Bw solum is dark reddish brown to strong brown, has a large C content (9. 0 - 4. 4 %), and meets all the requirements of an andic horizon. In these horizons, oxalate extractable iron content (1. 62. 8 % Fe-o) represents 76 - 84 % of free iron, and is much larger than Al-o (0. 8 - 1. 5 %). Both biotite and plagioclase are sources of Fe and Al. The fort-nation of non-allophanic Andosol from granite was likely due to {{the combination of the}} following factors: cool and humid climate, large accumulation of organic matter, high infiltration rate, intense water percolation during spring thawing and significant content of weatherable minerals. As such conditions are not rare in European highlands, andic soils are probably more widespread in Europe than is currently thought. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|With climate change, {{water may}} become limited for {{intensive}} agriculture even in regions presently considered “water-rich”. Information {{about the potential}} water requirement and its temporal and spatial variability can help to develop future water management plans. A case study was carried out for Switzerland with its highly complex pre-alpine topography and <b>steep</b> gradients in <b>climate.</b> The hydrological model WaSiM-ETH was used to simulate net irrigation requirement (NIR) for cropland, grassland and orchards using criteria to define irrigation periods based either on the water stress level (expressed by the ratio of actual (aET) to potential evapotranspiration ((pET) (Method 1) or on thresholds for soil water potential (Method 2). Simulations for selected catchments were carried out with a daily time step for the period 1981 - 2010 using a 500 × 500 m spatial resolution. Catchment-scale NIR ranged between 0 and 4. 3 million m 3 and 0 and 7. 3 million m 3 for the two methods, respectively, with no trend over the observation period in any catchment. During the heat wave in 2003, NIR increased {{by a factor of}} 1. 5 to 2. 3 relative to the mean, and in catchments where discharge is directly dependent on precipitation, NIR in the summer of 2003 reached the limits of river water availability. In contrast, in a region with water supply from glacier melt water, highest NIR in 2003 still remained far below total river discharge. The results show that NIR varies strongly between years and across the landscape, and even in a presently cool-temperate climate, irrigation may put pressure on regional water resources under extreme climatic conditions that may become more frequent {{by the end of the}} 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve {{understanding}} of the role of organic inputs and soil organic matter (SOM) for crop production in contemporary arable farming in Europe. For this purpose, long-term experiments were analysed on the additional yield effect of organic inputs and savings in mineral fertiliser. In addition, a farm survey was conducted to find drivers and barriers for the use of organic inputs and to assess if arable farmers in Europe perceive a deficiency of SOM. The findings in this thesis suggest that at least on the shorter term, on average, {{there seems to be no}} immediate threat from a deficiency of SOM to crop production in arable farming in Europe. The long-term experiments showed that with sufficient use of only mineral fertilisers, on average, similar yields could be attained over multiple years as with the combined use of organic inputs and mineral fertiliser. This was reflected in the farm survey, in which a large majority of farmers indicated not to perceive a deficiency of SOM. Analysis of long-term experiments also showed that more mineral fertiliser N was saved when using farmyard manure at high N rates (with mineral fertiliser application) than at low N rates (without mineral fertiliser application), based on comparisons at equal yield. Specific crops and environments did benefit from organic inputs and more SOM in terms of crop production. Long-term experiments showed that organic inputs give benefit to crop production in wet climates and on sandy soils. In addition, farmers perceived a higher deficiency of SOM on steep slopes, sandy soils, wet and very dry climates. The additional yield effect of organic inputs was significant for potatoes. More in general, farmers who cultivated larger shares of their land with specialized crops (including potatoes, sugar beets, onions and other vegetables) than cereals perceived a higher deficiency of SOM. It seems that while the functions of SOM can be replaced with technical means to a large extent (e. g. tillage, use of mineral fertilisers), there are limits to this technical potential when environmental conditions are more extreme and crops are more demanding. The farm survey revealed that farmers perceive a trade-off between improved soil quality on the one hand and increased pressures from weeds, pests and diseases and financial consequences on the other hand when using organic inputs. If policies aim to stimulate the maintenance or increase of SOM, more insight is needed into the conditions that regulate the pressures of weeds, pests and diseases in response to organic inputs. Financial consequences (at least on the short term) should also be accounted for. More importantly however, benefits from SOM for crop production cannot be taken for granted. Only in specific situations such benefits will exist. If European policies on SOM aim to include benefits for crop production, focus should be on areas with more extreme environmental conditions (very dry or wet <b>climates,</b> <b>steep</b> slopes, sandy soils), or cropping systems with more specialized or horticultural crops rather than cereals...|$|R
