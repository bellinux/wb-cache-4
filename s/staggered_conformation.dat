5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of octaphenylrhodocene shows a <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> (similar {{to that of}} ferrocene, and {{in contrast to the}} eclipsed conformation of ruthenocene). The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar to those found in the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation.</b> Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} where hyperconjugation may {{be overlooked}} {{as a possible}} chemical explanation is in rationalizing the rotational barrier of ethane. It had been accepted {{as early as the}} 1930s that the <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations</b> of ethane were more stable than the eclipsed conformation. Wilson had proven that the energy barrier between any pair of eclipsed and <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations</b> is approximately 3 kcal/mol, and the generally accepted rationale for this was the unfavorable steric interactions between hydrogen atoms.|$|R
50|$|In butane, the two <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations</b> are {{no longer}} {{equivalent}} and represent two distinct conformers:the anti-conformation (left-most, below) and the gauche conformation (right-most, below).|$|R
50|$|Rotation {{around the}} C-5/C-6 bond is {{described}} by the angle ω. Three possible <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations</b> possible; gauche-trans (gt), gauche-gauche (gg), trans-gauche(tg). The name indicates the interaction between O-5 and OH-6 first followed by the interaction between OH-6 and C-4.|$|R
25|$|As {{far back}} as 1890–1891, chemists {{suggested}} that ethane molecules preferred the <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> with the two ends of the molecule askew from each other.|$|E
25|$|The two {{conformation}}s, {{also known}} as rotamers, differ in energy: The <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> is 12.6nbsp&kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).|$|E
25|$|This {{difference}} in energy {{between the two}} conformations, known as the torsion energy, is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C–C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH3 group by 120° relative to the other, is {{of the order of}} 10−11nbsp&seconds.|$|E
50|$|Such a {{conformation}} {{exists in}} any open chain single chemical bond connecting two sp3-hybridised atoms, and is normally a conformational energy minimum. For some molecules {{such as those}} of n-butane, there can be special versions of <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations</b> called gauche and anti; see first Newman projection diagram in Conformational isomerism.|$|R
50|$|For example, ethane (C2H6) {{has three}} {{equivalent}} <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations.</b> Conversion of one conformation to another occurs at ordinary temperature by internal rotation of one methyl group {{relative to the}} other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C3 axis, but {{can be described as}} a permutation of the three identical hydrogen atoms of one methyl group. Although each conformation has D3d symmetry as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group.|$|R

They reproduce very successfully the differences in molecular geometry observed by x-ray and neutron diffraction of single crystals of the methyl cy-D- and methyl 0 -D-pyranosides. Calculations carried out at the 6 - 3 1 G* level for methanediol confirm the earlier calculations at the 4 - 31 G level, with smaller energy differences between the four <b>staggered</b> <b>conformations...</b>|$|R
25|$|In their 2001 paper, however, Pophristic and Goodman {{revealed}} that this explanation {{may be too}} simplistic. Goodman focused on three principal physical factors: hyperconjugative interactions, exchange repulsion defined by the Pauli exclusion principle, and electrostatic interactions (Coulomb interactions). By comparing a traditional ethane molecule and a hypothetical ethane molecule with all exchange repulsions removed, potential curves were prepared by plotting torsional angle versus energy for each molecule. The analysis of the curves determined that the <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> had no connection {{to the amount of}} electrostatic repulsions within the molecule. These results demonstrate that Coulombic forces do not explain the favored staggered conformations, despite the fact that central bond stretching decreases electrostatic interactions.|$|E
25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation.</b>|$|E
500|$|Structural {{studies of}} termetallocene systems have shown they {{typically}} adopt an [...] "eclipsed double transoid" [...] "crankshaft" [...] geometry. Taking {{as an example}} the 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene cation shown above, {{this means that the}} cobaltocenyl and rhodocenyl moieties are eclipsed, and thus carbon atoms 1 and 1' on the central ferrocene core are as close to vertically aligned as is possible given the <b>staggered</b> <b>conformation</b> of the cyclopentadienyl rings within each metallocene unit. Viewed from side-on, this means termetallocenes resemble the down–up–down pattern of a crankshaft. The synthesis of this termetallocene involves the combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with 1,1'-dilithioferrocene. This produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl–cyclopentadiene ligands whose bonding resembles that found in the rhodocene dimer. These ligands then react with the triphenylmethyl carbocation to generate the termetallocene salt, (PF6)2. This synthetic pathway is illustrated below: ...|$|E
