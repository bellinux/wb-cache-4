The AAFC's first season was not set to <b>start</b> <b>until</b> {{the fall of}} 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the Rochester Royals of the National Basketball League (NBL), a forerunner of the National Basketball Association. In March 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the Sheboygan Redskins to win the NBL title.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party {{personnel}} gathered in Australia, prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship, SY Aurora. Organisational and financial problems delayed their <b>start</b> <b>until</b> December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season. After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel, in the process losing most of their sled dogs.|$|E
5|$|The T65E1 was {{accepted}} into service as the M19 Gun Motor Carriage in May 1944 with {{an order for}} 904 production models, which was sent to Cadillac. Production did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> August of that year, and only 285 were produced {{by the end of}} the war.

From January to March 2002, production for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind took place primarily in California and Montreal. The Playboy Mansion scene was shot in early April at Los Angeles, California; the remaining two weeks of production took place around the Mexico â€“ United States border. Filming for Confessions ended in late April 2002.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} was in {{development}} and discussions were taking place as early as September 2012, the recording did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> the Spring of 2013, being delayed by Gaga's hip surgery and cancellation of her Born This Way Ball tour. The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet.

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Emigration {{patterns}} in the Nordic countriesFinland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Icelandshow striking variation. Nordic mass emigration started in Norway, which also retained the highest rate throughout the century. Sweden got underway in the early 1840s, and had the third-highest rate in all of Europe, after Ireland and Norway. Denmark had a consistently low rate of emigration, while Iceland had a late start but soon reached levels comparable to Norway. Finland, whose mass emigration did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> the late 1880s, {{and at the time}} part of the Russian Empire, is usually classified as part of the Eastern European wave.|$|E

In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E

5|$|The Earl of Warwick's estates {{included}} sawmills, quarries, brickworks and collieries {{in addition}} to agricultural holdings. Bell pits, around Clutton and High Littleton, were described {{in a survey of}} 1610. All were closed by 1836. The first deep mine in the parish of High Littleton was Mearns Coalworks which began in 1783. The Greyfield Coal Company did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> 1833 and expanded after the opening of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway in 1847. Greyfield Colliery closed in 1911, and the railway in 1964. Maynard Terrace in Clutton was built to house some of the miners.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in 1989 but production did not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson, and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and so had music lessons. The Phantom of the Opera grossed approximately $154 million worldwide, despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, which praised the visuals and acting but criticized the writing and directing.|$|E
5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant that the Test could not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> midday had passed. The damp {{conditions}} meant that sawdust had to be added in large amounts to allow the players to keep their grip. The humid conditions, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers, with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to distribute the film, with further financing from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films. Filming at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina lasted from November 1992 to March 1993. The New York City scale model set was designed by Michael J. McAlister and Mark Stetson, with further effects provided by The Computer Film Company. Upon its release in March 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|As {{few other}} {{persons in the}} Confederate {{government}} were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, {{as well as the}} navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the <b>start</b> <b>until</b> the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title {{until the end of the}} war. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.|$|E
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not <b>start</b> <b>until</b> after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
