40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} defect {{is often}} found in an air cooled jumbo steel ingot, which will influence {{the quality of the}} final rolled plates. In practical production, some rolled plates are frequently rejected due to the serious shrinkage porosity of the ingot. To improve the quality of the ingot, a new cooling method, gradient cooling process (in which {{the upper part of the}} ingot is air cooled and the lower part is spray cooled) was put forward in this study. The solidification behaviors for a 60 t jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling condition were simulated using the ProCast software, and the results were compared with those of an ingot by air cooling condition. The solidifying tendency, temperature field and distribution of shrinkage porosities in the ingot under different cooling conditions were analyzed. Simulation results show that under gradient cooling condition the solidification of the <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> progresses in an upward manner along the vertical z axis and in a centripetal manner along the horizontal x and y axes. Gradient cooling can efficiently reduce shrinkage porosity of the jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> by optimizing the solidification sequence, and making the position of shrinkage porosity move from near the middle height of the ingot (under air cooling condition) towards the head of the ingot; and the secondary shrinkage is eliminated. In addition, the solidification time of the ingot under gradient cooling is 7. 3 h in this simulation, which is 2. 7 h faster than that under air cooling. A 60 t jumbo <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> was successfully produced under gradient cooling condition. The ingot was rolled to a plate with a thickness of 100 mm and length of 18, 000 mm, and ultrasonic flaw detection was performed. Some porosity was found along the axis of the plate at 4, 900 - 6, 000 mm from the head of the plate, indicating that the position of the defect is moved towards the head of the ingot. This distribution trend of the defect is consistent with the simulated result...|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} in the {{production}} of forgings from tool steels, especially thick plates, blocks, pulleys and rods which are used for special machine components for demanding applications, it is the inhomogeneous structure with segregations, cracks in segregations or complex type of non-metallic inclusions MnS and TiCN. These forgings are actually produced from conventional forging ingots. Due to the size of forgings, it would be interesting the production of these forgings from <b>slab</b> <b>ingots.</b> It is possible that the production of forgings from <b>slab</b> <b>ingots</b> (which are distinguished by a characteristic aspect ratio A/B), it would reduce the occurrence of segregations. The paper presents the verification of the production process of <b>slab</b> steel <b>ingots</b> in particular by means of numerical modelling using finite element method. The paper describes the pre-processing, processing and post-processing phases of numerical modelling. The attention was focused on the prediction of behavior of hot metal during the mold filling, on the verification of the final porosity, of the final segregation and on the prediction of risk of cracks depending on the actual geometry of the mold.

The sides of the ingot below the mold are cooled to remove heat of fusion and energy transferred to the solidification interface by superheated liquid metal in the mold. A two-region analysis is made to determine the non-uniform heat conduction from the liquid metal to the interface, and then from the interface to the cooled ingot sides. The solidification interface shape is found that {{is compatible with the}} removal of fusion energy and nonuniform heating from the liquid.

40|$|Abstract. The method {{based on}} {{solidification}} mathematical model and Flemings formula was adopted to simulate electroslag remelting process. The simulation {{results show that}} the depth of the molten pool become deeper with increasing of melting speed, and when the ingot gets to the certain height, the system is in the quasi-steady state, the pool shape doesn’t change. With increasing of melting speed, secondary dendrite spacing become wider too and secondary dendrite spacing become wider gradually from the surface to center of ingot if melting speed is const. According to the simulated dendrite spacing, micro-structure of <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> is estimated to if meeting the demand of solidification quality, and if it can’t meeting this demand, technological conditions(melting speed) should be modified, and recalculating secondary dendrite spacing, controlling solidification structure...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the two-dimensional interface shape of a <b>slab</b> <b>ingot</b> being cast continuously by withdrawing it from a mold. The sides of the ingot are being cooled and the upper boundary of the ingot is in contact with a pool of molten metal. The solidification interface shape was determined from the analysis of the heat flow, utilizing the condition that the solidification interface is at constant temperature and must be normal to the lines of heat flow carrying away latent heat of fusion from the interface. The analysis includes the effect of interface curvature which, for a constant rate of withdrawing the cast ingot from the mold, causes the solidification to be nonuniform along the interface. The {{analysis was}} carried out by a conformal mapping procedure...|$|E

It is argued that the method may be more direct for some geometries than the Cauchy boundary value method. Moreover, the usefulness of the Cauchy boundary value method is demonstrated through the example of a nonsymmetric horizontal mold where the walls are offset to support the lower ingot boundary...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum as a primary structural metal stems from a quest in automotive, aerospace, and marine industries to be more energy efficient and sustainable. This unprecedented demand drives aluminum casting methods towards increased productivity looking to, cast larger ingots faster. The unfortunate consequence {{of this approach is}} an enhanced variation of metallurgical properties over the cross section of <b>slab</b> <b>ingots.</b> Rolling <b>slab</b> <b>ingots</b> of AlCu 4. 5 using a typical Direct-Chill casting technique have been cast and sectioned for analysis. This alloy allowed us to compare our results with the available literature and to elucidate the marked differences in spatial variation of microstructure and composition found in radial and lateral symmetry castings. In an attempt to couple conventional theory with our results, sump and temperature profiles were measured in-situ and modeled using a commercial finite element analysis software package. The combination of experimental and modeling results indicate that the variations in the cooling parameters through the cross section are largely responsible for the spatial variances in metallurgical properties, pointing to a possible refinement of DC casting parameters. by Samuel R.

40|$|Cyprus was {{undoubtedly}} the main area of {{production of the}} copper oxhide ingots found in different Mediterranean countries. Recent research at Politiko Phorades and Maroni shows that the casting of the oxhide ingots required a complex process which involved both inland mining and coastal sites. Egyptian and Near Eastern written sources suggest that not only oxhide ingots but possibly other raw copper (ore, matte or other semi-processed material) were exported from Alashiya/Cyprus. However, lead isotope analysis of some ingots from Late Minoan I contexts and archaeological evidence from Ras Ibn Hani, in the Ugaritic kingdom, and Timna, in the political domain of Egypt, show that the oxhide ingots were not cast only in Cyprus, from at least {{the beginning of the}} Late Bronze Age to the last centuries of the second millennium BC. Leaving aside the copper oxhide ingots depicted in the well-known scenes of tribute of the Theban tombs, special attention is here paid to Egyptian foundry scenes, especially that depicted in Hepu tomb. A group of oxhide ingots is here displayed above the craftsmen who are represented in act of fanning a fire. A review of Egyptian scenes of various workshops shows that from the Old Kingdom the products of the working activities are generally displayed {{in the same way as}} in the Hepu tomb. It is therefore very likely that the aim of this scene is to epitomize the casting of the copper oxhide ingots displayed above. If this interpretation is right, the production of copper oxhide ingots should be admitted also in Egypt during the 15 th- 14 th centuries BC, although on a far smaller scale than in Cyprus. The foundry scene in Nebamūn and Ipuki tomb is more ambiguous, but it may also depict the casting of a tin <b>slab</b> <b>ingot...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the feasibility of plastic forming by hot rolling of the AA 2519 aluminium alloy sheets and cladding these sheets with a layer of the EN AW- 1050 A alloy. Numerous hot-rolling tests were carried out on the <b>slab</b> <b>ingots</b> to define the parameters of the AA 2519 alloy rolling process. It has been established that rolling of the AA 2519 alloy should be carried out in the temperature range of 400 - 440 °C. Depending on the required final thickness of the sheet metal, appropriate thickness of the EN AW- 1050 A alloy sheet, used as a cladding layer, was selected. As a next step, structure and mechanical properties of the resulting AA 2519 alloy sheets clad with EN AW- 1050 A alloy was examined. The thickness of the coating layer was established at 0, 3 ÷ 0, 5 mm. Studies covered alloy grain size and the core alloy-cladding material bond strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{modifications}} of physicochemical properties of mould powders are usually obtained by {{control of their}} mineralogical composition. Depending on the mould powder form and grain size the thermal insulating changes within the mould. Thus, the mould powder density has {{a significant impact on}} heat exchange in mould. The experiments were carried out to increase the pulverised mould powder density by forming it into uniform shape blocks. Using the industrial continuous casting machine the experimental casting of <b>slab</b> <b>ingots</b> from low-carbon steel with pulverised, granulated and formed mould powder with identical mineralogical composition was carried out. The highest calculated consumption values Qs (kg/m 2) were obtained for the formed mould powder. The microscopic examinations of subsurface zone of the slabs cast with formed mould powder revealed the existence of hooks with smaller length and depth of penetration into slab structure than those in the slabs cast with granulated and pulverised mould powder. The results of the experiments have indicated that the use of formed mould powders allows increasing the casting speed without deterioration in quality of surface and subsurface zone of the continuous slab...|$|R

40|$|Twin Roll Casting (TRC) is {{a process}} by which thin strip is {{produced}} directly from molten metal. This process has many advantages over traditional Direct Chill (DC) casting where metal is cast into large <b>slabs</b> or <b>ingots</b> and subsequently hot and cold rolled into strips. While the DC casting involves large capital investment and energy consumption, TRC produces strip with thickness {{in the range of}} 10 mm to 2. 5 mm in one operation without hot rolling, with less cost, energy usage and equipment requirements. In TRC AA 3105, high solidification and post-solidification cooling rates lead to high manganese supersaturation throughout the as-cast strip and very fine constituent particles near strip surface. After 90 % cold rolling, the TRC material shows sluggish recrystallization kinetics and a very coarse grain structure, due to concurrent forming dispersoids and/or fine constituent particles. These particles interfere with the nucleation process by preventing migration of the boundaries associated with potential nuclei, resulting in fewer recrystallization nuclei and slower nucleation rate. In addition, the fine particles can impede grain growth by exerting a pinning pressure on moving boundaries. The current study investigated the microstructure evolution in TRC AA 3105 during different thermo-mechanical treatments. A systematic study of the effects of different homogenization treatments on second phase particles was carried out. The heating rate effect on recrystallization was studies using an infrared heating furnace. The effect of second phase particles on recrystallization behavior was summarized and experimental results were presented. It was shown that a desirable, fine recrystallized grain size could be obtained by either of two means- rapid heating rate ot the annealing tempeature, or by a pre-cold work homogenization heat treatment...|$|R
