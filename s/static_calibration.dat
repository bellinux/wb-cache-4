40|$|The {{critical}} issues concerning {{the application of}} constant-temperature hot-film anemometry to hypersonic flow are reviewed and extended. Mass-flux <b>static</b> <b>calibrations</b> were conducted in a Mach 10 helium flow, while mass-flux and total-temperature <b>static</b> <b>calibrations</b> were made in a Mach 6 air flow. In addition, comparative hot-film/hot-wire turbulence measurements were made in a Mach 11 helium boundary layer to {{provide insight into the}} dynamic response of the hot film. The measurements indicate that substrate conduction 'losses' dominate the static response of the hot-film probe, thus resulting in poor sensitivity to mass-flux and total temperature. Furthermore, it has been found that {{it is not possible to}} isolate mass-flux fluctuations at high overheat ratios for the current hot-film design. Thus, the sapphire-substrate hot-film anemometer is a robust, high-bandwidth instrument limited to qualitative transition and turbulence measurements.

The three algorithms include one approach resting on <b>static</b> <b>calibration,</b> one that is applying a Kalman filter {{and the third is}} exploiting an inverse identification scheme. To demonstrate and evaluate the alternative methods, two load cases including periodic excitation by sinusoidal wheelrail irregularities and transient excitation by an insulated rail joint are considered. Based on a previously presented vehicletrack interaction model in the time domain, load scenarios are defined by taking the calculated vertical wheelrail contact forces as the reference force to be re-identified by the proposed algorithms. The reference contact forces are applied on a finite element model of the wheel to generate synthetic observation data, that is, radial strains at the positions of the strain gauges, serving as input to the identification procedures.

40|$|Abstract. Endoscopic {{images are}} {{strongly}} affected by lens distortion {{caused by the}} use of wide angle lenses. In case of endoscopy systems with exchangeable optics, e. g. in bladder endoscopy or sinus endoscopy, the camera sensor and the optics do not form a rigid system but they can be shifted and rotated with respect to each other during an examination. This flexibility has a major impact on the location of the distortion centre as it is moved along with the optics. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for the dynamic correction of lens distortion in cystoscopy which is based on a one time calibration. For the compensation, we combine a conventional static method for distortion correction with an algorithm to detect the position and the orientation of the elliptic field of view. This enables us to estimate the position of the distortion centre according to the relative movement of camera and optics. Therewith, a distortion correction for arbitrary rotation angles and shifts becomes possible without performing <b>static</b> <b>calibrations</b> for every possible combination of shifts and angles beforehand. ...|$|R

This valve {{will be used}} to inject air and to impart momentum to the flow inside the first stage of a multi-stage compressor. The valve was designed to deliver a maximum mass flow of 0. 22 lbm/s (0. 1 kg/s) with a maximum valve throat area of 0. 12 sq. in (80 sq. mm), a 100 psid (689 KPA) pressure difference across the valve and a 68 F, (20 C) air supply.

A <b>static</b> flow <b>calibration</b> revealed a nonlinear valve orifice area to mass flow relationship which limits the maximum flow rate that the valve can deliver.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of wave propagation in viscoelastic materials is investigated both theoretically and experimentally, with attention directed to two areas. First, analytical methods of solution are developed for certain wave propagation problems in {{one and two}} dimensions utilizing realistic material properties. This is accomplished by use of time-dependent material property characterization through a Dirichlet series representation to overcome {{the limitations of the}} widely-used simple spring and dashpot models involving two or three elements. The Laplace transformed solutions are then inverted by an extension of the Schapery collocation method to dynamic situations. The second topic deals with dynamic photoelasticity applied to viscoelastic materials. It is shown that the relationships between stress optic and strain optic coefficients for linearly viscoelastic materials can be formulated. Then the time-dependent birefringence characteristics of a typical low modulus polymer material are determined from constant strain rate tests for a full range of dynamic loading rates by taking advantage of the time-temperature shift phenomenon. Much recent work in dynamic photoviscoelasticity has been based on <b>static</b> <b>calibrations</b> only. Hence to put the technique on a firm foundation and indicate the general necessity of including the time dependency in treatment of material properties, a comparison is made of predicted fringe patterns with experimental results for both one- and two-dimensional situations.

The results indicate the feasibility of quantitative photoviscoelasticity for dynamic stress analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, calibration {{and application of}} an instrument that measures the effects of unsteady air flow (airwake) on a helicopter in flight. The instrument is a 1 / 54 th-scale model helicopter that is mounted on a six-component dynamic force balance to measure the forces and moments that an airwake imposes onto the helicopter; it is therefore an ‘Airwake Dynamometer’ to which we have given the name AirDyn. The AirDyn has been designed, in particular, to measure {{the effect of a}} ship airwake on a helicopter translating over the ship’s landing deck. The AirDyn, which has been implemented in a water tunnel, in preference to a wind tunnel, senses the integrated effect of a turbulent airwake on the helicopter, and the resulting unsteady forces and moments are an indication of the workload the pilot would need to exert to counteract these effects in a real helicopter. Binocular sensing elements and semiconductor strain gauges have been adopted to achieve high sensitivity and relatively high stiffness. The compact strain gauge balance is fitted into the helicopter fuselage, and protective coatings and a flexible bellows are used to seal the balance and protect it from the water. The coefficient matrix of the AirDyn has been obtained by <b>static</b> <b>calibrations,</b> while impulse excitation tests have confirmed that its frequency response is suitable for the measurements of unsteady loads. The application of the instrument is illustrated by using it to quantify the effect that a bulky ship mast has on the airwake and thus on a helicopter as it lands onto a simplified ship in a scaled 50 knot headwind...|$|R
