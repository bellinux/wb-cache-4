40|$|R 290 is a {{potential}} refrigerant replacing R 22 because of its zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and virtually zero Global Warming Potential (GWP). However, R 290 is flammable and requires excellent containment to avoid leakage and {{reduce the risk of}} fire. The use of small diameter copper tube (5 mm or even smaller) is an effective way to reduce refrigerant charge and thus reduce the risk of fire {{in the event of a}} refrigerant leak. However, employing small diameter copper tube will increase pressure drop and consequently reduce system performance. A <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger which employs the low temperature refrigerant in <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> to cool down the refrigerant before expansion value is {{a potential}} solution to improve system performance because R 290 has low discharge temperature compared with HFC refrigerants (e. g. R 22, R 410 A). This paper presents an investigation of application of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger in an R 290 air conditioner with small diameter copper tube. A theoretical analysis is proposed at first to investigate the effect of the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger on capacity and system energy efficiency under variable evaporating and cooling temperatures. A prototype R 290 air conditioner with and without a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger is tested in order to explore the effect of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger on system performance and refrigerant charge in real working conditions. Finally, a refrigerant circuit solution for heat pump air conditioners is proposed. The results of theoretical analysis indicate that the capacity and system energy efficiency increase linearly with the heat exchange of the suctionline heat exchanger, and the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger can improves capacity by up to 12 % and system energy efficiency by up to 4 % under both cooling and heating modes. This is because the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger increases the sub-cooling but has less impact on compressor power due to good thermal properties of R 290. Further, the evaporating and condensation temperature have insignificant impact on the performance of <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger. The experimental results show that the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger improves the cooling capacity and system efficiency by 5. 3 % and 4. 5 %, respectively. These results agree well with that of the system analysis. The sub-cooling temperature increases 10. 2 o C and the discharge temperature increases 25. 4 o C. Further, the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger reduces the refrigerant charge by as much as 6 %. This is because <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger increases the discharge temperature, and thus the superheat region of the condenser increases resulting in less refrigerant in the condenser. Overall, the use of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger in a system with small diameter copper tube improves the performance of R 290 and more importantly reduces the refrigerant charge...|$|E

Given the complexity of illness and the need to prioritize care in ICU patients, clinicians may not consider routine procedures as causing pain. With patients in intensive care undergoing frequent routine procedures, greater understanding of which procedures inflict pain is warranted to improve patient care and inform and shape nursing practice.

40|$|Many ways is {{possible}} to improve the compressor efficiency, like to reduce the mechanical losses through valve or bearing which represents from 20 % to 30 % of total electric consumption power on the compressor. Another ways is to decrease the pressure drop through the compression circuit of the compressor, which can reduce the temperature variation through the compressor…etc. In our case of study, we will {{be interested in the}} heat transfer and pressure drop through the suction circuit. In this paper, we present the challenge done on the heat transfer reduction through the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> of the CAJ 4519 Z compressor, in reducing from 10 °C to 20 °C the flow temperature through the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> and, thus improve the cooling capacity in increasing density of the flow. Indeed, according to the mechanical conception of the compressor, the <b>suction</b> <b>line,</b> the fresh part of the flow, is in contact with the discharge line, the hot part of the flow, at the cylinder head part. Thus, thermal conduction phenomena at this level heat up the fresh flow of the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> therefore decrease the density of the flow which impacts on the global cooling capacity of the compressor. In this case of study, the cylinder head is on cast iron material, and separates the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> (fresh flow at 64 °C) with the discharge line (hot flow at 115 °C) by a thickness wall of 0. 8 cm. Consequently, the fresh flow of <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> reheats by the conductivity and loses between 10 °C and 20 °C according to the operating condition. To reduce the conductivity phenomenon on the cylinder head, a judicious choice of material is done according to the Ashby methodology based on the conductivity coefficient, and a new concept of cylinder head is done. Before, testing the new concept of the cylinder head, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation allows understanding the improvement through the standard and new cylinder head concept, and allows defining the position of the sensor. The laboratory test result confirms the simulation results. Thus, thanks to the thermal characteristic of the material and re design the cylinder head part, we can reduce the temperature and improve by 2 % (average value) the cooling capacity of the compressor...|$|E

40|$|Capillary {{tubes are}} used as {{refrigerant}} controlling devices, expansion devices and also as heart of a small vapor compression refrigeration cycle. It connects outlet condenser to the inlet evaporator and balances the refrigeration cycle pressure and controls the refrigerant mass flux. Capillary tubes are relatively cheap, resulting in extensive implementations in small household refrigerators and freezers with nearly constant refrigeration load. In general, the inner diameter and length of a capillary tube ranges are from 0. 5 - 2. 0 mm, and 2 - 6 m, respectively. In some vapor compression refrigeration cycle applications (VCRC), capillary tubes are coiled to minimize the space. The fluid flow in coiled capillary tubes is subjected to the centrifugal force which causes secondary flow effect. Some researchers have referred to Dean effect to describe this secondary flow. Dean Number is defined as De = Re (d/D) 0. 5 that affects the amount of heat transfer, momentum, and mass flux in both kinds of coiled tubes. Generally, in domestic refrigerators, the capillary tube and <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> is soldered {{to each other in}} order to increase the heat transfer between them, which results in increasing cooling capacity, and avoid the entering of liquid into the compressor. The refrigerant flow through capillary tube flow is notably affected by the heat transfer to the <b>suction</b> <b>line.</b> The adiabatic flow follows a path that is close to an isenthalpic line, whilst the non-adiabatic flow is projected toward the line of saturated liquid, increasing the amount of liquid in the two-phase mixture and decreasing the vapor quality at the evaporator inlet. As a consequence, the refrigerating effect in the evaporator is increased. This paper presents experimental study of refrigerant flow through helical non-adiabatic (diabatic) capillary tubes. This model is validated by previously published experimental data and also by test results performed and presented in this work for R- 134 a. The effect of capillary tube inner diameter, length, relative roughness and coil diameter, and also various test conditions such as inlet pressure, inlet temperature, and sub-cooling degree of refrigerants is investigated. Pressure distribution and temperature variation are obtained experimentally. Furthermore, main subject of this study is experimental investigation of diabatic helical capillary tubes. Therefore this experimental set up is used for investigation of metastable flow, re-condensation, choked and hysteresis phenomenon. The experimental results illustrated that critical ratio (Gc/Gs) is main parameters that affect metastable flow through coiled diabatic capillary tube. If mass flux in the coiled capillary tube (Gc) is constant, the rate of heat transfer from the capillary tube to the suction decreases with a decrease of the mass flux in the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> (Gs). Therefore, an increase of the mass flux ratio represents a decrease of the heat transfer rate between the capillary tube and <b>suction</b> <b>line.</b> The results show that metastable flow in the diabatic coiled capillary tube with 1. 397 mm inner diameter, 30 mm coil diameter, 4360 mm length, 4 mm inner diameter of <b>suction</b> <b>line,</b> exists when the heat transfer rate between the coiled capillary tube and the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> is weak with Gc/Gs 3 ̆e 343...|$|E
40|$|A digital {{distributed}} parameter {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} propellant-feed- system coupling and various hydraulic parameters on the analytical prediction of chugging instabilities. Coupling between the combustion chamber and feed system was controlled by varying the compliance of the injector-dome region. The coupling with the feed system above the pump was varied by changing the amount of cavitation compliance at the pump inlet. The stability limits and chugging frequencies proved to be strongly dependent on the degree of feed-system coupling. The maximum stability condition occurred with intermediate coupling. Under conditions of a high degree of feed-system-combustor coupling, the stability limits and chugging frequencies were primarily dependent on the feed-system characteristics; the responses were characterized by beating patterns. For the system analyzed, the pump <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> had little effect on the stability limits or chugging frequencies. Beating, present under the condition of near zero injector -dome compliance, was eliminated when the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> was decoupled by employing a sufficiently high value of pump-inlet compliance. Under conditions of maximum feed-system coupling, the magnitude and distribution of line losses in the discharge line had a significant effect on the stability limits but had negligible effect on the chugging frequency and beating characteristics. Also, the length of the discharge line greatly affected the stability limits, chugging frequency, and beating characteristics. The length of the <b>suction</b> <b>line,</b> however, had little effect on the stability limits and chugging frequency but did influence the beating pattern.
