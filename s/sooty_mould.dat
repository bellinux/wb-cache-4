5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} thought to be a {{herbivore}} which scrapes biofilm such as algae and <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> off the surface of living leaves.|$|E
50|$|Scorias spongiosa is a <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> fungus {{that grows}} on aphid honeydew. It {{is a member}} of the Capnodiaceae family of ascomycete fungi. It is found only on American beech trees, Fagus grandifolia.|$|E
50|$|It has low {{resistance}} to certain biological pests, {{such as the}} olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae and <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> On the other hand, it has high tolerance to cold and drought.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSooty moulds are {{saprophytic}} ascomycetes {{with brown}} hyphae, often forming extensive subicula on living plant surfaces. These fungi growon plant exudates and honeydewsecreted by sap sucking insects and are ubiquitous in many humid terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we review previously published specimens of <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> and provide new fossil evidence that traces {{the fossil record}} of these fungi for about 100 million years, from the early Miocene (17 million years) to the Early Cretaceous (Albian, about 100 to 113 million years). Investigation of Mesozoic and Cenozoic ambers {{from different parts of}} the world revealed <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> from eight northern hemisphere amber deposits. Fragments of superficial subicula composed of smooth brown moniliform hyphae with tapering distal ends identical to those produced by extant species in the familyMetacapnodiaceae (Capnodiales) are recorded since the Albian. The fossil fungi originate from tropical to temperate coastal forests where they grew on leaves and bark of different conifer and angiospermtrees. This indicates that capnodialean <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> have occupied their specialized niche since at least from when early angiosperms appeared in the fossil record...|$|R
50|$|It has low {{resistance}} to certain biological pests, {{such as the}} Saissetia oleae and <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds,</b> and {{to a certain extent}} also the Bactrocera oleae (Olive fruit fly). On the other hand, it is quite tolerant of cold weather.|$|R
50|$|Scorias is a genus of fungi {{within the}} Capnodiaceae family. The genus was first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries in 1832. The fungus {{is known as}} <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> and is found growing on honeydew on leaves of many varieties of trees and plants.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} insects also act as pests and parasites. The Webbing Caterpillar causes damage to many young Leptospermum species, using webbing to matt the leaves {{together}} and deposit droppings inside. Scale insects can suck the sap from stems and leaves and secrete {{a substance that}} causes <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> to grow, blackening the foliage.|$|E
50|$|This is one eremophila {{that does}} not make as {{valuable}} a garden plant as many others. It tends to become woody and sometimes blackened by <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> It is difficult to propagate except by cuttings and prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade. It is drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost.|$|E
50|$|It is {{vulnerable}} to certain organic pests, primarily the Bactrocera oleae (Olive fruit fly). Other risks are the Saissetia oleae, Spilocaea oleaginea and <b>Sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> Also starlings are particularly fond of the Cailletier. While somewhat vulnerable to cold, it has high resistance to drought.|$|R
50|$|Aphis craccivora causes {{direct damage}} to plants by {{stunting}} and distorting growth. The honeydew produced is deposited on {{the plants and}} encourages the growth of <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> which restrict photosynthesis. The aphid is the vector {{of a number of}} plant viruses including groundnut rosette virus, peanut mottle virus, peanut stunt virus, subterranean clover stunt virus, bean common mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus and alfalfa mosaic virus.|$|R
50|$|A major {{drawback}} {{with this}} cultivar is its vulnerability to certain biological pests, {{such as the}} Bactrocera oleae, Pseudomonas syringae, Saissetia oleae, and <b>Sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> On the other hand, it has an exceptional resistance to cold; after the devastatingly hard winter of 1956, when most French olive orchards were destroyed, many Olivi√®re trees survived. That means {{that some of the}} trees of this variety are over 400 years old.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, brown {{soft scale}} has been {{controlled}} {{by the use of}} pesticides, but these have the disadvantage that other insects, friends and foes alike, are also killed. Another approach in citrus is to eliminate ants from the trees, either by preventing the ants from climbing the trunks or by destroying their nests. This allows natural predators to flourish and keep the scale insects under control, although this may lead to an increase in the production of <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> Fungicides can be used to prevent the <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> from taking hold. Alternatively, the use of such entomopathogenic fungi, such as Verticillium lecanii, has been successfully used under glass. An alternative approach is integrated pest management in which the natural enemies of the scale insects are encouraged. A further possibility is the use of growth regulators such as the hormone hydroprene which disrupts the moulting of juvenile scale insects.|$|E
50|$|The papaya {{mealybug}} inserts its stylet {{into the}} epidermis {{of the leaf}} or the skin of fruit or stem and feeds on the plant sap. At {{the same time it}} injects a toxic substance into the plant which results in chlorosis, distortion, stunting, early leaf and fruit fall, the production of honeydew, <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> and possibly the death of the plant.|$|E
50|$|This {{particularly}} fragrant shrub {{grows up}} to two metres tall, though most often it is around one metre tall and wide. Leaves are a pale green, 5 to 9 mm long, 1 to 3 mm wide. The shape of the plant shows wide spreading branches. Branches may be stained by a <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> Attractive pink or lilac flowers form in the warmer months of the year. Though flowering may occur sporadically. The original specimen was collected by the explorer Allan Cunningham.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> grow in thin black layers on {{leaves on}} which aphids, witefly or other sap-sucking insects have {{deposited}} their honeydew. It does not grow parasitically but it harms plants indirectly {{and is also}} unsightly. The mould coats the leaves and this blocks out light and makes photosynthesis less effective. Plant growth can be reduced, leaves covered in mould may die prematurely {{and there may be}} a reduction in fruit yield.|$|R
40|$|In Singapore and the Malay Peninsula <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> {{and black}} mildews are common. Colonies of these fungi on plant foliage often consist of several species mixed {{together}} and each species may produce {{more than one}} type of conidia and other fruiting structures. The specimens collected and examined are described and listed under Ascomycetes (17 species) and Fungi Imperfecti (16 species). The most common species were those of Meliola and Microxyphium. A host list is provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Jassids (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) are {{cell sap}} sucking insects of plants of {{economic}} importance. While sucking the cell sap they inject toxins into the plant body and cause yellowing and curling {{of leaves and}} flowers. Eventually, growth of the plant is retarded and flowering and fruiting bodies drop down. The <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> affect photosynthesis and the yield of crops. Therefore, biodiversity of Jassids has been reported from Kolhapur district. In all, 22 species of Jassids belonging to the genera Deltocephalus...|$|R
50|$|Ants {{are often}} present among the colonies, feeding on the {{honeydew}} secreted by the aphids. The {{presence of the}} ants is beneficial to the aphids as the ants deter and remove predators that might feed on the aphids; these include the larvae of the midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza and parasitoids which lay their eggs in the aphid nymphs. High levels of infestation by the aphids can cause stunted shoots, disfigured fruit and premature leaf fall, especially in young trees, and <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> may form on excess honeydew secretions.|$|E
50|$|Eremophila exilifolia is an erect, flat-topped shrub {{with very}} sticky foliage usually growing to {{a height of}} between 0.3 and 1 m. The {{branches}} are thickly coated with resin making them sticky and shiny but often becoming black due {{to the growth of}} <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> The leaves are also thickly covered with resin and are crowded, often overlapping each other near the ends of the branches. They are also pitted, the pits often appearing as dark spots. The leaves are linear to almost club-shaped, 2.5-12 mm long and 0.6-1.5 mm wide.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain all the {{nutrients}} they need, the scale insects ingest large quantities of sap. They then secrete the excess sugary fluid as honeydew. This is attractive to ants which often tend the scale insects, driving away predators. The brown soft scale does not normally kill the host plant, but the loss of sap probably causes it to grow more slowly and crop less heavily. The main disadvantage to the host is the <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> which grows on the honeydew. This reduces the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, and spoils {{the appearance of the}} plant, its flowers and fruits.|$|E
50|$|Like the adults, the nymphs also {{feed upon}} sap, and unlike adults, have an {{extensible}} anal tube that appears designed to deposit honeydew {{away from their}} bodies. The tube appears to be longer in solitary species rarely attended by ants. It is important for sap-feeding bugs to dispose of honeydew, as otherwise it can become infected with <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> Indeed, one of the evident benefits of ants for Publilia concava nymphs is that the ants remove the honeydew and reduce such fungal growth.|$|R
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|R
50|$|The {{adults and}} nymphs {{of the cotton}} aphid feed on the {{underside}} of leaves or on the growing tips of shoots, sucking juices from the plant. The foliage may become chlorotic and die prematurely. There is often a great deal of leaf curling and distortion which hinders efficient photosynthesis. Honeydew is excreted by the aphids and this allows <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> to grow, resulting in a decrease in {{the quantity and quality of}} the produce. The aphids are a vector of crinkle, mosaic, rosette, CTV and other virus diseases. The aphids' impact is especially important on vegetable crops such as courgette, melon, cucumber, aubergine and strawberry and on cotton, citrus and mallow.|$|R
50|$|Scale insects {{can occur}} in both rural and urban environments, but town trees are usually less healthy and pest burdens tend to be higher in towns. This {{is thought to be}} due to various habitat {{differences}} in urban settings; higher temperatures, more air pollution, lower availability of nutrients, and more stress caused by lack of moisture (more run-off and less water penetrating the ground). P. regalis is primarily a pest of urban trees; its sap-sucking activities reduce its hosts' vigour, and the excess honeydew produced by the insects encourages the growth of <b>sooty</b> <b>mould,</b> which is unsightly.|$|E
5000|$|The tree {{is subject}} to {{shrouding}} by a parasitic vine [...] Powdery mildew causes defoliation and fruit-drop, {{but it can be}} adequately controlled. Lesser diseases are <b>sooty</b> <b>mould,</b> brown rot and leaf-spot. Leafspot results from infestation by Cercospora spp. and Isariopsis indica var. zizyphi. In 1973, a witches'-broom disease caused by a mycoplasma-like organism was found in jujube plants near Poona University. It proved to be transmitted by grafting or budding diseased scions onto healthy Z. mauritiana seedlings. Leaf rust, caused by Phakopsora zizyphivulgaris, ranges from mild to severe on all commercial cultivars in the Punjab.|$|E
50|$|Although {{many species}} of Hemiptera are {{significant}} pests of crops and garden plants, including {{many species of}} aphid and scale insects, other species are harmless. The damage done is often {{not so much the}} deprivation of the plant of its sap, but the fact that they transmit serious viral diseases between plants. They often produce copious amounts of honeydew which encourages the growth of <b>sooty</b> <b>mould.</b> Significant pests include the cottony cushion scale, a pest of citrus fruit trees, the green peach aphid and other aphids which attack crops worldwide and transmit diseases, and jumping plant lice which are often host plant-specific and transmit diseases.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe new fossil thrips Uzelothrips eocenicus P. Nel and A. Nel sp. nov. (Thysanoptera: Uzelothripidae) is {{described}} from two lowermost Eocene amber-preserved specimens (one macropterous and one apterous). The family Uzelothripidae is only known {{so far from}} a single extant species, Uzelothrips scabrosus. The fossils differ from the extant species only by the antennal segments III and IV, which appear distinctly separated instead of being fused as {{in the in the}} extant U. scabrosus. Dark-coloured hyphae and conidia of the Dothideomycetes (Ascomycota) which are likely to belong to the <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> (Capnodiales) are attached to the apterous fossil specimen. We consider this arthropod-fungus association not to be accidental since these fungi are also found in extant specimens of these uzelothripids, suggesting very specific long-term interactions and strong habitat specificity...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{approach was}} used to investigate the fungal microbiome associated with Bactrocera oleae a major key pest of Olea europea, using the ITS 2 region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as barcode gene. Amplicons were cloned and a representative number of sequenced fragments were used as barcode genes for the identification of fungi. The analysis of the detected sequence types (STs) enabled the identification {{of a total of}} 34 phylotypes which were associated with 10 fungal species, 3 species complexes and 8 genera. Three phylotypes remained unresolved within the order Saccharomycetales and the phylum Ascomycota {{because of the lack of}} closely related sequences in GenBank. Cladosporium was the most abundantly detected genus, followed by Alternaria and Aureobasidium, well-known components of olive <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> Interestingly, Colletotrichum sp. and other fungal plant pathogens were also detected, leading to potential new insights into heir epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{descriptions}} of larvae of the nitidulid beetles Soronia oculata Reitter and Hisparonia hystrix (Sharp), {{compare them with}} similar larvae of other nitidulids, and comment on the utility of larval data in phylogenetic studies. Soronia oculata larvae are quite similar to many other larvae within the Soronia genus complex, but those of H. hystrix are distinctly different, namely by having an unfringed, spinose mandibular prostheca, striations of mola obscured by blunt teeth, and malar setae that are course and restricted to the distal half. This supports the recent transfer of the species to a monotypic genus. Larvae of S. oculata inhabit fermenting sap flows on woody plants and those of H. hystrix are found on <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> Both species are endemic to New Zealand, where they are widespread. A single unconfirmed record of H. hystrix from Fiji might represent an introduction. A species list of New Zealand nitidulid taxa is appended...|$|R
50|$|Scorias spongiosa is a {{specialist}} and grows {{exclusively on the}} honeydew formed by colonies of the beech blight aphid, Grylloprociphilus imbricator. This aphid is found only on one host plant, the American beech tree, Fagus grandifolia, where it congregates on branches and twigs, creating copious amounts of honeydew that drip onto vegetation below. The large quantity of honeydew enables this fungus to grow to a large size, much bigger than other <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> fungi, which produce only a thin black layer {{on the surface of}} leaves. On tree trunks this fungus has been known to grow into a mass of hyphae as big as a football, but it is more usual for the agglomeration on branches or twigs to reach a diameter of about fifteen centimetres.|$|E
50|$|This aphid {{is a major}} pest of dwarf {{beans and}} clover, where it feeds on leaves and stems. Where {{infection}} rates are high, yellowing, twisting, stunting and leaf drop may occur, young seedlings may die and plants regrowing after cutting are severely affected. This aphid does more damage to lucerne crops than does pea aphid, and yields of the crop may be severely reduced even at low population densities, particularly in spring and autumn. Further damage may also occur to the plants {{as a result of}} the accumulation of honeydew and the <b>sooty</b> <b>mould</b> that grows on it, and the aphid can be a vector of alfalfa mosaic virus, lucerne transient streak virus and lucerne Australian latent virus in lucerne, as well as cucumber mosaic virus, bean yellow mosaic virus and watermelon mosaic virus in other crops.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spiralling}} whitefly {{may cause}} damage to crops in several ways. The feeding of the adults, {{and particularly the}} sucking of sap by the first three nymphal stages, weakens the plant and causes leaves to fall prematurely, but is seldom sufficient to kill the plant. The copious amounts of honeydew secreted by the insects is appreciated by ants, wasps, bees and other insects and these may protect the whitefly from predation. <b>Sooty</b> <b>mould</b> often grows on the honeydew and may reduce the leaf area available for photosynthesis, disfigure the plant and even make it unmarketable. The nymphs produce a flocculent white waxy material {{and this may be}} dispersed by the wind and create [...] "an unsightly nuisance". The spiralling whitefly can act as a vector and is one of only three species of whitefly able to transmit plant viruses. In some cases, these may cause the complete loss of the crop.|$|E
40|$|Chocolate Spot leaf {{disease of}} Eucalyptus is {{associated}} with several Heteroconium-like species of hyphomycetes that resemble Heteroconium s. str. in morphology. They differ, however, in their ecology, with the former being plant pathogenic, while Heteroconium s. str. is a genus of <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds.</b> Results of molecular analyses, inferred from DNA sequences of the large subunit (LSU) and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) region of nrDNA, delineated four Heteroconium-like species on Eucalyptus, namely H. eucalypti, H. kleinziense, Alysidiella parasitica, and one isolate resembling a novel species in a clade separate from the holotype of Heteroconium, H. citharexyli. Based on molecular phylogeny, morphology and ecology, the Heteroconium-like species associated with Chocolate Spot disease are reclassified in the genus Alysidiella, which is shown to have mycelium that is immersed in and superficial on the host tissue and conidiogenous cells that can have loci that are either inconspicuous or proliferating percurrently. Furthermore, conidiogenous cells can either occur solitary on hyphae, or be sporodochial, arranged on a weakly developed stroma, which further distinguishes Alysidiella from Heteroconiu...|$|R
40|$|The Capnodiales {{incorporates}} {{plant and}} human pathogens, endophytes, saprobes and epiphytes, {{with a wide}} range of nutritional modes. Several species are lichenised, or occur as parasites on fungi, or animals. The aim of the present study was to use DNA sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal small and large subunit RNA genes to test the monophyly of the Capnodiales, and resolve families within the order. We designed primers to allow the amplification and sequencing of almost the complete nuclear ribosomal small and large subunit RNA genes. Other than the Capnodiaceae (<b>sooty</b> <b>moulds),</b> and the Davidiellaceae, which contains saprobes and plant pathogens, the order presently incorporates families of major plant pathological importance such as the Mycosphaerellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae and Schizothyriaceae. The Piedraiaceae was not supported, but resolves in the Teratosphaeriaceae. The Dissoconiaceae is introduced as a new family to accommodate Dissoconium and Ramichloridium. Lichenisation, as well as the ability to be saprobic or plant pathogenic evolved more than once in several families, though the taxa in the upper clades of the tree lead us to conclude that the strictly plant pathogenic, nectrotrophic families evolved from saprobic ancestors (Capnodiaceae), which is the more primitive stat...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the Capnodiaceae with notes on {{selected}} genera. Type specimens of the ascomycetous genera Aithaloderma, Anopeltis, Callebaea, Capnodaria, Echinothecium, Phragmocapnias and Scorias were re-examined, described and illustrated. Leptoxyphium is anamorphic Capnodiaceae and Polychaeton {{is a legitimate}} and earlier name for Capnodium, {{but in order to}} maintain nomenclatural stability we propose that the teleomorphic name should be considered for the approved lists of names currently in preparation for fungi. Notes are provided on the ascomycetous genus Scoriadopsis. However, we were unable to locate the type of this genus during the time frame of this study. The ascomycetous genera Aithaloderma, Ceramoclasteropsis, Hyaloscolecostroma and Trichomerium are excluded from Capnodiaceae on the basis of having ascostromata and trans-septate hyaline ascospores and should be accommodated in Chaetothyriaceae. Callebaea is excluded as the ascomata are thyriothecia and the genus is placed in Micropeltidaceae. Echinothecium is excluded as synonym of Sphaerellothecium and is transferred to Mycosphaerellaceae. The type specimen of Capnophaeum is lost and this should be considered as a doubtful genus. The coelomycetous Microxiphium is polyphyletic, while the status of Fumiglobus, Polychaetella and Tripospermum is unclear. Fourteen new collections of <b>sooty</b> <b>moulds</b> made in Thailand were isolated and sequenced. The nuclear large and small rDNA was partially sequenced and compared in a phylogeny used to build a more complete understanding of the relationships of genera in Capnodiaceae. Four new species are described and illustrated, while Phragmocapnias and Scorias are epitypified with fresh collections...|$|R
