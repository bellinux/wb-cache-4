25|$|Oats are {{relatively}} free from diseases and pests {{with the exception}} being leaf diseases, such as leaf rust and stem rust. However, Puccinia coronata var. avenae is a pathogen that can greatly reduce crop yields. A few lepidopteran caterpillars feed on the plants—e.g. rustic shoulder-knot and <b>setaceous</b> Hebrew character moths, but these rarely become a major pest. See also List of oat diseases.|$|E

2500|$|Zea {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} (in the Americas) the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), the corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea), and the stem borers Diatraea and Chilo; in the Old World, it is attacked by the double-striped pug, the cutworms heart and club and heart and dart, [...] Hypercompe indecisa, the rustic shoulder-knot, the <b>setaceous</b> Hebrew Character and turnip moths, and the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), among many others.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} point--that spines are {{not due to}} {{mammalian}} selection--we are able to adduce what must be considered direct and conclusive evidence. For if spines, admittedly produced by aborted branches, petioles, or peduncles, are due solely or mainly to diminished vegetativeness or ebbing vitality, they ought to occur in all countries alike, or at all events in all whose similar conditions tend to check vegetation; whereas, if they are, solely or mainly, developed as a protection against the attacks of herbivorous mammals, {{they ought to be}} most abundant where these are plentiful, and rare or absent where indigenous mammalia are wanting. Oceanic islands, as compared with continents, would thus furnish a crucial test of the two theories; and Mr. Hemsley of Kew, who has specially studied insular floras, has given me some valuable information on this point. He says: [...] "There are no spiny or prickly plants in the indigenous element of the St. Helena flora. The relatively rich flora of the Sandwich Isles is not absolutely without a prickly plant, but almost so. All the endemic genera are unarmed, and the endemic species of almost every other genus. Even such genera as Zanthoxylon, Acacia, Xylosoma, Lycium, and Solanum, of which there are many armed species in other countries, are only represented by unarmed species. The two endemic Rubi have the prickles reduced to the <b>setaceous</b> condition, and the two palms are unarmed.|$|E

50|$|The {{forewings}} of {{this species}} are greyish to rufous brown. Typically these are marked with a black mark shaped like the Hebrew letter Nun (נ).

5000|$|... ==Taxonomy and naming== The {{species was}} first {{formally}} described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description {{was published in}} Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (setacea) {{is derived from the}} Latin word saeta meaning [...] "bristle" [...] hence <b>setaceous</b> meaning [...] "bristle-like" [...] referring to the hairs on the flower stalk and sepals.|$|E
50|$|The genus Hystrix {{was created}} in 1794 by Conrad Moench for the species {{described}} as Elymus hystrix by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Moench considered that E. hystrix was sufficiently distinct {{to be placed in}} a separate genus as Hystrix patula; the genus was to be used for species without glumes or with long <b>setaceous</b> glumes. Subsequently a number of other grass species were placed in this genus.|$|E
