40|$|Abstract — Because Ethernet {{bridging}} {{does not}} scale, most enterprise networks consist of small Ethernet-based subnets interconnected by IP routers. Although Ethernet’s flat addressing and transparent bridging allow each subnet {{to run with}} minimal configuration, interconnecting subnets at the IP level introduces significant management overhead that increases {{with the size of}} the network. As an alternative, we propose a scalable and efficient zero-configuration enterprise (<b>SEIZE)</b> networking architecture. <b>SEIZE</b> provides plug-and-play capability via globally unique flat addressing, while ensuring scalability and efficiency through shortest-path routing and hash-based location resolution. Switches perform location resolution on demand and can cache the results to optimize routing paths and {{to reduce the number of}} location-resolution requests.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} anti-drug policing, both {{the federal government}} and many state governments have enacted laws that allow police agencies to keep a substantial fraction of assets that they <b>seize</b> in drug arrests. By adjusting their own allocations to police budgets, however, county governments can effectively undermine these incentives, capturing the additional resources for other uses. We use a rich new data set on police seizures and county spending to explore the reactions of both local governments and police to the complex incentives generated by these laws. We find that local governments do indeed offset the seizures that police make by reducing their other allocations to policing, undermining the statutory incentive created by the laws. They are more likely to do so in times of fiscal distress. Police, in turn, respond to the real net incentives for seizures, once local offsets are taken into account, not simply the incentives set out in statute. When de facto policies allow police to keep the assets they <b>seize,</b> they <b>seize</b> more. These findings have strong implications for the effectiveness of using financial incentives to solve agency problems in the provision of public goods in a federal system: agents respond to incentives, but so do intervening governments, and the effectiveness of federal and state laws in influencing agents' behavior is limited by the ability of local governments to divert funds to other uses. ...|$|R

60|$|But now we {{approached}} Springfield, and perhaps at Springfield we should find the enemy. Surely {{if they did}} not oppose the passage they would blow up the bridge. Tiny patrols--beetles on a green baize carpet--scoured the plain, and before we reached the crease--scarcely perceptible at a mile's distance, in which the Little Tugela flows--word was brought that no Dutchmen were anywhere to be seen. Captain Gough, it appeared, with one man had ridden over the bridge in safety; more than that, had actually explored three miles on the further side: did not believe there was a Boer this side of the Tugela: would like to push on to Potgieter's and make certain: 'Perhaps we can <b>seize</b> Potgieter's to-night. They don't like having a flooded river behind them.' So we come safely to Springfield--three houses, a long wooden bridge 'erected by public subscription, at a cost of 4,300l.'--half a dozen farms with their tin roofs and tree clumps seen in the neighbourhood--and no Boers. Orders were to <b>seize</b> the bridge: <b>seized</b> accordingly; and after all had crossed and watered in the Little Tugela--swollen by the rains to quite a considerable Tugela, eighty yards wide--we looked about for something else to do.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{an outcome}} of ancient canons which forbade clerics to dispose by will of goods accruing from their ecclesiastical office. These canons were {{gradually}} relaxed {{because of the difficulty}} of distinguishing between ecclesiastical and patrimonial property. Abuses then arose: Churches were despoiled at the death of their incumbents; Bishops and archdeacons <b>seized</b> for the cathedral the spoil of abbeys and other benefices, on the pretence that all other churches were but offshoots of the cathedral. After the fall of the Western Empire, anyone present at the death of a cleric felt at liberty to carry off whatever property of the deceased, ecclesiastical or otherwise, he could <b>seize</b> (rapite capite, <b>seize</b> and take). As the civil power became more conscious of itself it began to restrain this indiscriminate plunder. The sovereign claimed for himself the [...] "Jus Spolii" [...] in the case of deceased bishops, while the smaller feudal lords laid similar claim to the property of all clerics who died in their domains. Councils (Tribur, 895; Trosly, 909; Clermont, 1095; II Lateran, 1139) of the Church legislated against these abuses, finally obtaining a renunciation of this so-called right. In the thirteenth century the Roman Church put forth in a modified way the same claim, and it eventually became a principle of canon law that the goods of beneficed ecclesiastics, dying intestate, belonged of right to the papal treasury. This right however was not allowed in France, Germany, Belgium or Portugal. In the Kingdom of Naples a compromise was made {{at the close of the}} sixteenth century, whereby the right was renounced for an annual payment to the papal treasury.|$|R

At Beijing Normal University, red flags flutter and unfurl in the early morning breeze above the sports ground. Thousands of students mill about, excitedly falling into groups and lining up to take to the streets and march to Tiananmen Square. The great May Fourth demonstration is underway despite stern warnings in the press and strict police orders not to take the protest to the streets. That’s the real May Fourth Spirit! Defiance in the face of danger! Knock down the old, make way for the new! Challenge authority! The early morning air is refreshingly cool with only the faintest trace of coal dust now that the long winter is over. Animated, nervous, smiling faces bask in the honey-colored glow of a brilliant morning sun. Even the birds, rare as they are in Beijing, add to the defiant chorus! <b>Seize</b> the hour! <b>Seize</b> the day! Wake up! China, Wake up! The atmosphere is electric; but the movement of rebel forces gentle, cooperative and fluidly choreographed. Large red banners with bright yellow characters of the kind used in school sports meets announce group affiliations such as History Department, Educational Psychology, Arts Choral Group, but it is the national flag of China that takes the place of honor in the student color guard. Self-appointed student leaders run around the thickening assembly of students with battery-operated megaphones trying to get others to listen, trying to instill order and decorum...|$|R
60|$|The fête, then, is over; the pompous black pyramid at the Louvre {{is only a}} {{skeleton}} now; all the flags have been miraculously whisked away during the night, and the fine chandeliers which glittered down the Champs Elysées for full half a mile, have been consigned to their dens and darkness. Will they ever be reproduced for other celebrations of the glorious 29th of July?--I think not; the Government which vowed {{that there should be}} no more persecutions of the press, was, on that very 29th, <b>seizing</b> a Legitimist paper, for some real or fancied offence against it: it had <b>seized,</b> and was <b>seizing</b> daily, numbers of persons merely suspected of being disaffected (and you may fancy how liberty is understood, when some of these prisoners, the other day, on coming to trial, were found guilty and sentenced to ONE day's imprisonment, after THIRTY-SIX DAYS' DETENTION ON SUSPICION). I think the Government which follows such a system, cannot be very anxious about any farther revolutionary fêtes, and that the Chamber may reasonably refuse to vote more money for them. Why should men be so mighty proud of having, on a certain day, cut a certain number of their fellow-countrymen's throats? The Guards and the Line employed this time nine years did no more than those who cannonaded the starving Lyonnese, or bayoneted the luckless inhabitants of the Rue Transnounain:--they did but fulfil the soldier's honorable duty:--his superiors bid him kill and he killeth:--perhaps, had he gone to his work with a little more heart, the result would have been different, and then--would the conquering party have been justified in annually rejoicing over the conquered? Would we have thought Charles X. justified in causing fireworks to be blazed, and concerts to be sung, and speeches to be spouted, in commemoration of his victory over his slaughtered countrymen?--I wish for my part they would allow the people to go about their business as on the other 362 days of the year, and leave the Champs Elysées free for the omnibuses to run, and the Tuileries' in quiet, so that the nurse-maids might come as usual, and the newspapers be read for a halfpenny apiece.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the view}} of the Albanians, the shift in China's line between 1956 and 1960 was due to the following: [...] "After the death of Stalin, the Chinese, with Mao Zedong at the head, thought that their time had come ... they wanted to gain {{as much as they could}} from Soviet {{economic}} aid, in order to become a great power, indeed, an atomic power. But these projects could not be carried out smoothly. If Mao Zedong had his hegemonistic ambitions, Khrushchev and his associates had their expansionist plans, too. ... While making most of what benefit they could get from the Chinese, at the same time Khrushchev and his associates began to be 'cautious' and 'restrained' in their support and aid for them. They did not want China to grow strong, economically or militarily. ... The policy of rapprochement with American imperialism, which Khrushchev was pursuing, likewise, was incompatible with the interests of the Chinese, because that would leave China out of the game of great powers. In this situation, seeing that Khrushchev's line had caused concern in the communist movement, the Communist Party of China <b>seized</b> the opportunity ... <b>seized</b> the 'banner' of defence of the principles of Marxism-Leninism. ... Undoubtedly, not to compel Khrushchev to abandon his course of betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, but to have him accept the hegemony of China and join it in its plans." [...] As Hoxha put it, [...] "when Mao Zedong and his associates saw that they would not easily emerge triumphant over the patriarch of modern revisionism, Khrushchev, through the revisionist contest, they changed their tactic, pretended to reject their former flag, presented themselves as 'pure Marxist-Leninists', striving in this way, to win those positions which they had been unable to win with their former tactic. When this second tactic turned out no good, either, they 'discarded' their second, allegedly Marxist-Leninist, flag and came out in the arena as they had always been, opportunists, loyal champions of a line of conciliation and capitulation towards capital and reaction. We were to see all these things confirmed in practice, through a long, difficult and glorious struggle which our Party waged in defence of Marxism-Leninism." ...|$|R

On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to <b>seize</b> the submarines, <b>seizing</b> some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it <b>seized</b> in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of <b>seizing</b> not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|R
