In the past, as this type of application of large inverters, it has been possible to apply variable <b>speed</b> <b>inverter</b> motors to larger compressor trains. The power sources of the inverters have various frequency fluctuations depending on the inverter type. These torque fluctuations may cause torsional vibration on the shafts. Most centrifugal compressor trains that are driven by variable <b>speed</b> <b>inverter</b> motors use speed-increasing gears. Since the gear meshing force induced by the torsional vibrations also causes lateral vibrations in the compressor trains. This torsional and lateral coupled vibration model shows {{a difference in the}} rotordynamic characteristics apart from the results obtained from independent torsional and lateral studies. Therefore, a rotordynamic analysis that considers a coupled torsional and lateral vibration system is effective in evaluating torsional vibrations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The applications of robust squirrel-cage induction motors in variable <b>speed</b> <b>inverter</b> drive systems have increased considerably due to the availability of easily controlled semiconductor switching devices. One problem encountered in inverter drives is the non-sinusoidal nature of the supply voltage, which results in increased motor losses and harmful torque pulsations producing undesirable speed oscillations. The latter effects are negligible at high frequency operation, due to the damping effect of the rotor and load inertia. However, torque pulsations and speed ripple may be appreciable at low frequency, wore they may result in abnormal wear of gear-teeth or torsional shaft failure. Hence, in applications where constant or precise speed control is important, eg; machine tool, antenna positioning, traction drives etc., {{it is essential to}} establish a method for determining the magnitudes of these torque pulsations and speed ripple, as a first stage in minimizing or eliminating them. When a voltage source inverter is used in such applications, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are usually employed, whereby the quasi square waveshape is modulated so as to minimize or eliminate the low order harmonic voltage components and thereby reduce the torque pulsations. Recent investigations have shown that total elimination of low order components does not produce optimal efficiency or torque pulsations and speed ripple. minimization. This thesis describes new PWM strategies which does not rely on complete elimination of low order harmonics, but on controlling the magnitude and phase of these components to achieve a smooth rotor motion. Initially, a mathematical model for the inverter/induction motor drive was developed, based on numerical integration of the system differential equations. The changing topology of the inverter bridge was simulated using tensor techniques. Then an analytical method, based on harmonic equivalent circuit analysis was proposed for calculating the induction motor pulsating torque components under steady-state operating conditions, in terms of stator and rotor current harmonics. The accuracy of this method was verified by comparing its results with those obtained from the mathematical model developed earlier. This provided an extremely rapid, numerically stable and efficient means for evaluating harmonic current and torque components with balanced non-sinusoidal applied voltages. This method was then used to formulate the torque performance function necessary to determine the new optimal PWM switching strategies. Throughout the work, the predicted performance was extensively validated and supported by practical results obtained from an experimental rig specifically designed to drive the machine under different PWM techniques...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a major {{research}} project to analyse vibro-acoustic characteristics from variable <b>speed</b> <b>inverter</b> driven induction motors (VSIDIM). The overall projects’ aimed at providing {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of sound generation from electromagnetic origins and developing a numerical model to predict the sound power emitted from a VSIDIM. The scope of this thesis is to assess experimentally the effect of various controller strategies on the radiated sound power and to develop a finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic force distribution over the stator. Various sources of noise in induction motors and their behaviour with speed and load have been reviewed. Models of the electromagnetic field and vibro-acoustic character have been discussed. An outline of various techniques of reducing noise in induction motors through design of inverters and modifications to the motor structure has been given. Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of controller strategies on the radiated sound power. Three different supplies were tested: a dynamotor which produces an almost sinusoidal supply with very low harmonic content, an inverter with a low switching frequency (less than 1 kHz) and an inverter with a high switching frequency (8 kHz) and various levels of random modulation. Results indicate that the sound power level of the MSC drive is a lot higher than that of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive. The sound power level of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive increases almost linearly with motor speed, that for the MSC drive is almost independent of speed. The sound power level of the MSC drive is almost 28 dB higher than that of the dynamotor drive at 450 rpm and the difference is reduced to 14 dB at 1500 rpm where the aerodynamic noise becomes more dominant. It has been found that at the rated speed (1500 rpm), the sound power level varies by less than 3 dB from no load to full load for all three sources. Although increasing the switching frequency increases the cost of the inverters and switching losses, results from the MSC and VSC 2000 drives clearly show that it reduces the radiated sound power by shifting the harmonics into higher and inaudible frequency range. The tonal nature around the switching frequency has been reduced by increasing the levels of random modulation to spread the energy over a wider range of frequencies, although the sound power level has not varied by more than 0. 2 dB. A finite element model has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force distribution. The quasi-static solution method has been implemented by stepping the rotor through the time domain using a fine regular mesh in the air gap. The stator currents were experimentally obtained while the rotor currents were obtained using a 4 parameter state space model of the motor. Results of the simulation indicate the influence of stator and rotor slots, saturation and time harmonics in the current. The calculated electromagnetic force distribution has been used in a FEM/BEM acoustic model and SEA acoustic model to predict the radiated sound power which agrees reasonably well with the measured sound, thus validating indirectly the electromagnetic force simulations...|$|E

50|$|An {{inverter}} circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main {{function is to}} invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor coupled with a resistor. Since this 'resistive-drain' approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at low cost. However, because current flows through the resistor {{in one of the}} two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing <b>speed.</b> Alternatively, <b>inverters</b> can be constructed using two complementary transistors in a CMOS configuration. This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states. Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices.

This paper investigates the influence of nonideal voltage measurements on the parameter estimation of permanentmagnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). The influence of nonideal voltage measurements, such as the dc bus voltage drop, zero shift in the amplifier, and voltage source inverter nonlinearities, on the estimation of different machine parameters is investigated by theoretical and experimental analysis. For analysis, a model-reference-adaptive-system-based estimator is first described for the parameter estimation of the q-axis inductance, stator winding resistance, and rotor flux linkage. The estimator is then applied to a prototype surface-mounted PMSM to investigate the influence of nonideal voltage measurement on the estimation of various machine parameter values.

40|$|Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) {{have several}} advantages, {{such as high}} ef¿ciency and low volume and weight, which make them {{attractive}} for aerospace applications and high performance servo drives. Matrix Converters (MCs) are an all-silicon alternative, with no bulky reactive elements, to the standard voltage source inverter. The most common control technique for such PMSM MC-fed drives is the so-called Field-Oriented Control (FOC), which requires the permanent magnet ¿ux position to achieve high dynamic performance. Encoders or resolvers {{are the most common}} sensing devices used for such a purpose, which not only increases the total cost of the PMSM drive but also adds extra electronics and cabling that may cause failures. This paper investigates and proposes an all range (from zero to full) speed hybrid sensorless FOC. The novelty of this paper relies on the use of a hybrid sensorless four quadrant FOC that averages the needed angle estimation from a model based angle estimator and a voltage pulse test injection angle estimator when feeding the PMSM with an MC instead of a standard voltage source <b>inverter.</b> <b>Speed</b> reversal and load impact simulation results are included, fully supporting the claims made in this paperPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of space vector based multi level inverter (MLI) fed vector controlled induction motor drive for low speed oparations is presented. The performance of indirect field oriented controlled induction motor drive (IMD) is poor with two-level <b>inverter</b> for low <b>speed</b> operations (LSO). The reduction in performance and peak value of torque are mainly due to the non-linearity caused by stator voltage drop and inverter. Hence the performance factors of induction motor drive are analysed with the multi level inverters under different operating conditions. In this approach, the steady state ripple content in the current and torque waveforms are reduced and that to ripple content of torque is reduced from 0. 15 to 0. 05 under steady state with five-level inverter. When there is a step change in the load torque, the momentary decrease in <b>speed</b> with five-level <b>inverter</b> is less when compared two and three-level <b>inverters</b> and the <b>speed</b> response reaches the reference value very quickly with five-level inverter during steady state and transient periods. So the overall performance of drive is improved with five-level inverter when compared to two-level and three- level <b>inverters</b> under low <b>speed</b> operations...|$|R
