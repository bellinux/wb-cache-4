40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> of two different non-heat treatable AlMn-alloys has been carried out. These alloys were a laboratory processed and an industrially processed AA 3103 -alloy. The primary objective of the laboratory processed alloy has been directed towards {{the relationship between the}} amount of manganese in supersaturated solid solution and the material behaviour during deformation and annealing. The focus for the industrially processed alloy was a detailed material characterisation during hot and cold rolling as well as to follow the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the alloy. The cold rolled microstructures were characterised with respect to subgrain size, misorientation across the subgrain boundaries, particle break-up and global texture. As far as it concerns the cold deformed microstructure {{it was found that the}} different homogenisation treatments, resulting in different amount of Mn in supersaturation, had little effect on the deformed microstructure. Detailed experimental work on the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> after cold deformation and the interaction between recrystallisation and precipitation, i. e. concurrent precipitation, has been carried out. Hardness and yield stress measurements, which defines the strength of the material, revealed that the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> was significantly slowed down in case of concurrent precipitation. It was further found that the precipitation reaction in this case occurred on the subgrain boundaries. Thus the precipitates considerably retarded the recrystallisation reaction as compared to the case when no precipitation occurred. TTT-diagrams have been constructed on the basis of hardness and conductivity measurements. From these diagrams a characteristic temperature, T c, for the different material conditions are identified. It was found that as the annealing was carried above this temperature the microstructure consisted of a fine grained equiaxed microstructure. Below T c the grains become elongated in the rolling direction and the average grain size became much coarser. With respect to recrystallisation texture, a very strong P-texture and in addition some ND-rotated cube texture was found in case of concurrent precipitation. This viistrong P-texture was investigated in detail, and it can be concluded that particle stimulated nucleation of recrystallisation (PSN) plays a significant role in the nucleation of these components. It was found that these texture components had a growth advantage in the early stage of annealing and that they are most probably a result of microgrowth selection, which often are related to a nucleation effect. When precipitation did not interact with recovery and recrystallisation the recrystallisation texture was either random or consisted of a weak cube texture. The <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the different materials has been modelled by a physically based softening model, which involves both the recovery and recrystallisation reactions. Both for the AlMn-alloys and for an additional commercially pure Al-alloy, relatively good model predictions were obtained for the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> when recrystallisation occurred prior to precipitation. However, when the softening reactions were retarded by heavy precipitation of dispersoids the model, in its original form, was not capable to predict the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In this case an additional retarding drag, which reduces the total number of viable recrystallisation nuclei, was added. With the addition of this drag relatively good model predictions were also obtained in case of concurrent precipitation.

40|$|Various {{constitutive}} {{models for}} {{the description of the}} elastoplastic deformation with an anisotropic hardening and also a transition from the elastic to the distinct-yield (fully-plastic) state have been proposed in the past.

Chip segmentation caused by the thermoplastic instability is always observed in titanium machining processes, which leads to varied cutting forces and chip thickness, etc. This paper presents an analytical modelling approach for cutting forces in near-orthogonal cutting of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V. The catastrophic shear instability in the primary shear plane is assumed as a semi-static process.

40|$|In March 2016, an {{addendum}} to the Dutch design guideline for micropiles, CUR 236, was published. This addendum elaborated on the ‘axial {{stiffness of}} micropiles’. The <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> was here first mentioned as an aspect relevant for the axial stiffness of the micropiles. Due to the slender {{geometry of the}} micropiles, this further translates into axial capacity. Up to this moment very little research was done into this phenomenon and to be conservative a ‘best guess’ of 50 % of the peak shear stress was made. The goal of this thesis {{is to have a}} more profound understanding about this (strain) <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour,</b> leading to the main research question: “How does strain softening manifest for micropiles under tensile loading?”. This strain <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be further subdivided into the mobilisation from peak to residual shear stress and the reduction of the residual shear stress relative to the peak. Furthermore, the installation effects play a big role in the bearing capacity. Also, some thought is given to the large scale measurements of the behaviour. Three different paths are chosen to research the strain <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Numerical modelling, small scale tests on sand and large scale pile tests are performed. In case of the numerical modelling, the large scale situation is simulated in the numerical software Plaxis, using an axisymmetric model and the hypoplastic constitutive model. Direct shear tests are assumed to represent {{a small part of the}} micropile, simulating the local <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Numerous tests are performed varying relative density and top pressure to assess the local strain <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Last, a method is developed to quantify the occurring ratio between peak and residual shear stress in-situ, extending on the current prescribed testing procedure (CUR 236, 2011). The only constitutive model available that describes the critical state soil behaviour for sand is the hypoplastic sand model. However, the combination of the tensile loading, softening implementation into the hypoplastic sand model in Plaxis and the deformations, induce considerable inaccuracies and physically impossible behaviour. This rejects further elaboration with this approach. The direct shear tests are performed on only sand, based on the results of Uesugi & Kishida (1987), assuming a rough surface. In summary, a clear dependency on relative density and average confining pressure is observed. Varying from a reduction of approximately 30 % for samples with the maximum possible density to 0 % for a sand with a medium dense packing. Furthermore, the displacements necessary to mobilise from peak to residual shear stress show a uniform trend, independent of relative density or pressure. Quantitatively, the displacement ranges between 2 and 3 mm. In the large scale tests, due to unexpected, structural failure, the majority of the test results, unfortunately, were unusable. The pile test that did produce workable results, behaved as expected. It could be deduced that the used methodology works. The use of the hypoplastic constitutive model in Plaxis, does not give the expected results. It can thus be concluded that a fully coupled stress – strain analysis of the problem is unfortunately impossible. Concluding on the direct shear tests performed, the implementation in the CUR 236 addendum is too simplistic. In terms of ratio between peak and residual shear stress, a dependency based on relative density and average confining pressure should be included. In terms of displacement, the found displacement is larger. It should however be noted that the direct shear tests are only a simplification, approximating the actual situation. The performed large scale tests do show results in line with expectations and could be used in the future to assess the <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour</b> in-situ. Plaxi...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlasticity {{and damage}} are two {{fundamental}} phenomena in nonlinear solid mechanics associated {{to the development}} of inelastic deformations and the reduction of the material stiffness. Alessi et al. [4] have recently shown, through a variational framework, that coupling a gradient-damage model with plasticity can lead to macroscopic behaviours assimilable to ductile and cohesive fracture. Here, we further expand this approach considering specific constitutive functions frequently used in phase-field models of brittle fracture. A numerical solution technique of the coupled elasto-damage-plasticity problem, based on an alternate minimisation algorithm, is proposed and tested against semi-analytical results. Considering a one-dimensional traction test, we illustrate the properties of four different regimes obtained by a suitable tuning of few key constitutive parameters. Namely, depending on the relative yield stresses and <b>softening</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the plasticity and the damage criteria, we obtain macroscopic responses assimilable to (i) brittle fracturèfracturè a la Griffith, (ii) cohesive fractures of the Barenblatt or Dugdale type, and (iii) a sort of cohesive fracture including a depinning energy contribution.

The SDE are the field equations of a quantum field theory, inter-relating the n-point Green’s functions. They contain all the information of the theory but are impossible to solve exactly since they are an infinite tower of coupled, non-linear integral equations.

40|$|Abstract. Cam-Clay nonassociative {{plasticity}} exhibits both hardening and <b>softening</b> <b>behaviour,</b> {{depending on}} the loading. For many initial data the classical formulation of the quasistatic evolution problem has no smooth solution. We propose here a notion of generalized solution, based on a viscoplastic approximation. To study the limit of the viscoplastic evolutions we rescale time, {{in such a way}} that the plastic strain is uniformly Lipschitz with respect to the rescaled time. The limit of these rescaled solutions, as the viscosity parameter tends to zero, is characterized through an energy-dissipation balance, that can be written in a natural way using the rescaled time. As shown in [4] and [6], the proposed solution may be discontinuous with respect to the original time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalised constitutive model for destructured, naturally structured and artificially structured clays that extends the Structured Cam Clay (SCC) model. This model is designated as ``Modified Structured Cam Clay (MSCC) model¿. The influence of structure and destructuring on the mechanical behaviour of clay {{can be explained}} by the change in the modified effective stress, which is the sum of the current mean effective stress and the additional mean effective stress due to structure (structure strength). The presence of structure increases the modified mean effective stress and yield surface, enhancing the cohesion, peak strength and stiffness. The destructuring begins when the stress state is on the virgin yield surface. After the failure (peak strength) state, the abrupt destructuring occurs as the soil¿cementation structure is crushed; hence the strain softening. The soil structure is completely removed at the critical state when the yield surface becomes identical to the destructured surface. The destructuring law is proposed based on this premise. In the MSCC model, the yield function is the same shape as that of the Modified Cam Clay (MCC) model. A plastic potential is introduced so as to account for the influence of structure on the plastic strain direction for both hardening and <b>softening</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The required model parameters are divided into those describing destructured properties and those describing structured properties.

The frequency-amplitude relationship for symmetric and antisymmetric vibration modes is studied and a numerical investigation is performed to describe the nonlinear phenomenon in a large range of values of the cable sag-to-span ratio. <b>Softening</b> and hardening <b>behaviour</b> is evidenced dependent on both the cable properties and the amplitude of oscillatio...|$|R
