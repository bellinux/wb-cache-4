5|$|Fort Stikine {{departed}} from New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada on 7 September 1942 {{and arrived at}} Vancouver the next day.

5|$|In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, {{where she}} {{captured}} an American ship; she {{then left the}} strait to avoid the frigate , which was known to cruise in these waters, and <b>sailed</b> to the Seychelles.

50|$|<b>Sail</b> kites: <b>Sails</b> {{that are}} fully {{tethered}} {{and give a}} net positive lift are <b>sail</b> kites. <b>Sailing</b> vessels on water and land use <b>sail</b> kites.

5|$|Pułaski next {{made her}} way to the Clyde in late October. Between 10 May and 12 June 1941, she <b>sailed</b> on three {{roundtrip}} trooping runs between Clyde and Iceland. In late June, Pułaski, loaded with 2,047 troops, <b>sailed</b> from Clyde to join convoy WS 9B headed for Freetown. The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 July. After three days, Pułaski and four other ships <b>sailed</b> on to Cape Town, arriving on 27 July. Leaving behind one ship at Cape Town, Pułaski and the others <b>sailed</b> on 30 July to their final destination of Aden, where they arrived in mid August.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski <b>sailed</b> on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and <b>sailed</b> the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and <b>sailed</b> the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|Siboney <b>sailed</b> for France on 30 June; after {{delivering}} her {{troops at}} Brest on 12July, {{she returned to}} New York on 25July. She <b>sailed</b> again on 31July.

Rigged {{only with}} double {{topgallant}} <b>sails</b> over double top <b>sails,</b> {{she was not}} equipped with royal <b>sails</b> (baldheader rigging) to save costs concerning gear and seamen. As with many baldheaded <b>sailing</b> ships the square <b>sails</b> were a little wider than the <b>sails</b> of a standard rigging to gain <b>sail</b> area for a better propulsion.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of her Lloyd North Atlantic career she carried some notable {{passengers}} to and from Europe. In May 1905, for example, noted Baltimore gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly, one of the co-founders of Johns Hopkins Hospital, <b>sailed</b> from New York; author Hamilton Wright Mabie and his wife <b>sailed</b> from New York the following month. American botanist Charles Frederick Millspaugh returned to New York aboard the German liner in June 1906, and retired U.S. Navy Rear admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan did the same in June 1907. Senator Augustus O. Bacon (D-GA), <b>sailed</b> for Europe on 1 August 1908.|$|E
40|$|Solar <b>sails</b> can be {{classified}} into two groups based on their method of stabilization: 1) truss supported, and 2) centrifugally (spin) supported. The truss configuration requires masts or booms to deploy, support, and rigidize the <b>sails</b> whereas the spin type uses the spacecrafts centrifugal force to deploy and stabilize the <b>sails.</b> The truss-supported type <b>sail</b> has a scaling limitation because as the <b>sail</b> area gets larger, the <b>sail</b> is increasingly more difficult to make and stow: the masts and booms get heavier, occupying more volume, and have increased risk during deployment. This major disadvantage limits {{the size of the}} <b>sail</b> area. The spin type comes in two configurations: 1) spinning square/disk <b>sail</b> and 2) heliogyro <b>sail.</b> This spinning square/disk <b>sail</b> architecture suffers the same <b>sail</b> area limitation as the truss-supported <b>sail...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Sails</b> may be {{classified}} as either triangular, which describes <b>sails</b> that either come to one point of suspension at the top or where the <b>sail</b> comes to a point at the forward end, or quadrilateral, which includes <b>sails</b> that are attached to a spar {{at the top and}} have three other sides, or as square. They also may {{be classified}} as symmetrical (square <b>sails</b> and symmetric spinnakers) or asymmetrical (most other <b>sails).</b> Typically, asymmetrical <b>sails</b> perform better on points of <b>sail</b> closer to the wind and are designed for fore-and-aft rigs than symmetrical <b>sails,</b> which perform best on points of <b>sail</b> that are further from the wind direction.|$|R
5|$|West Ekonk <b>sailed</b> to Port Costa, California, {{and took}} on a load of wheat flour and <b>sailed</b> for New York, via the Panama Canal, on 24 July. After {{reaching}} New York on 27 August, West Ekonk joined a France-bound convoy, departing on 4 September.|$|E
5|$|With the {{alterations}} complete, {{the veteran}} ship — now homeported at Los Angeles — <b>sailed</b> in August 1945 for Cristobál {{and on to}} Honolulu, Manila, Biak, Leyte, and Mindoro. After returning to Los Angeles in October, the Stafford <b>sailed</b> for Honolulu, Manila, and Eniwetok and back.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} of the Anglo-Polish {{military}} alliance impending, Pułaski <b>sailed</b> from Gdynia to Falmouth on 24 August 1939. On 26 September, the ship left Dartmouth for Gibraltar (calling there on 2 September) and Piraeus, where she arrived on 13 October. Picking up Polish soldiers there, she <b>sailed</b> five days later for Marseille, where she eventually arrived on 2 December. Until March 1940, Pułaski underwent a refit in Marseille after which she <b>sailed</b> under charter to the French Fabre Line. At the end of the 1930s, the Fabre Line <b>sailed</b> ships on a Marseille–Dakar route with intermediate stops in other African ports.|$|E
50|$|To {{catch the}} energy, Forward used a 1,000-km-diameter, {{circular}} aluminum <b>sail.</b> The <b>sail</b> resembled a flattened disk with a 300-km diameter removable center portion. When traveling to Rocheworld, the entire <b>sail</b> was used. When the ship needed to decelerate, the smaller <b>sail</b> {{was separated from}} the larger outer <b>sail.</b> The large <b>sail</b> {{was used as a}} reflecting lens, focusing light onto the smaller <b>sail,</b> slowing the craft.|$|R
50|$|High-performance <b>sailing</b> is {{achieved}} with low forward surface resistance—encountered by catamarans, <b>sailing</b> hydrofoils, iceboats or land <b>sailing</b> craft—as the <b>sailing</b> craft obtains motive power with its <b>sails</b> or aerofoils at speeds {{that are often}} faster than the wind.|$|R
