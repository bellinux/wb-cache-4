40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} we study autoparatopisms and near-autoparatopisms of <b>Latin</b> <b>squares.</b> Also we ﬁnd {{a family of}} <b>Latin</b> <b>squares</b> with an unique intercalate and no larger subsquares. Paratopism is a well known action of the wreath product Sn oS 3 on <b>Latin</b> <b>squares</b> oforder n. A paratopism that maps a <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> to itself is an autoparatopism of that <b>Latin</b> <b>square.</b> Let Par(n) denote the set of paratopisms that are an autoparatopism {{of at least one}} <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> of order n.

We construct a <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> Ln of order n with the following properties: • Ln has no proper subsquares of order 3 or more. • Ln has exactly one intercalate (subsquare of order 2). • When the intercalate is replaced by the other possible subsquare on the same symbols, the resulting <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> is in the same species as Ln.
