40|$|BACKGROUND: Uptake {{of human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccination is suboptimal among some groups. We aimed {{to determine the}} feasibility of undertaking a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of incentives to improve HPV vaccination uptake by increasing consent form return. METHODS: An equal-allocation, two-arm cluster RCT design was used. We invited 60 London schools to participate. Those agreeing were randomised to either a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> or incentive intervention arm, in which Year 8 girls {{had the chance to}} win a £ 50 shopping voucher if they returned a vaccination consent form, regardless of whether consent was provided. We collected data on school and parent participation rates and questionnaire response rates. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Six schools completed the trial and only 3 % of parents opted out. The response rate was 70 % for the girls' questionnaire and 17 % for the parents'. In the intervention arm, 87 % of girls returned a consent form compared with 67 % in the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> arm. The proportion of girls whose parents gave consent for vaccination was higher in the intervention arm (76 %) than the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> arm (61 %). CONCLUSIONS: An RCT of an incentive intervention is feasible. The intervention may improve vaccination uptake but a fully powered RCT is needed.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effect of an {{invitation}} promoting informed choice for screening with a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> on attendance and motivation to engage in preventive action. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting Four English general practices. Participants 1272 people aged 40 - 69 years, at risk for diabetes, identified from practice registers using a validated risk score and invited to attend for screening. Intervention Intervention was a previously validated invitation to inform the decision to attend screening, presenting diabetes as a serious potential problem, and providing details of possible {{costs and benefits of}} screening and treatment in text and pie charts. This was compared with a brief, <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> simply describing diabetes as a serious potential problem. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was attendance for screening. The secondary outcome measures were intention to make changes to lifestyle and satisfaction with decisions made among attenders. Results: The primary end point was analysed for all 1272 participants. 55. 8 % (353 / 633) of those in the informed choice group attended for screening, compared with 57. 6 % (368 / 639) in the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> group (mean difference - 1. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval - 7. 3 % to 3. 6 %; P= 0. 51). Attendance was lower among the more deprived group (most deprived third 47. 5 % v least deprived third 64. 3 %; P< 0. 001). Interaction between deprivation and effect of invitation type on attendance was not significant. Among attenders, intention to change behaviour was strong and unaffected by invitation type. Conclusions: Providing information to support choice did not adversely affect attendance for screening for diabetes. Those from more socially deprived groups were, however, less likely to attend, regardless of the type of invitation received.

40|$|Background Uptake of {{the human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccine in the UK is good, but there are pockets of the community who remain unprotected. Immunisation teams usually require written parental consent for a girl to receive the vaccine. Evidence suggests that uptake of the vaccine might be improved by promoting consent form return (if returned, forms are likely to grant consent). Incentivising girls to return consent forms is a promising approach to promoting consent form return. Before testing the efficacy of an incentive intervention in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), we must first establish whether the RCT is feasible. In this randomised feasibility study, we aim to establish the feasibility of conducting a cluster RCT of an adolescent incentive intervention to increase uptake of HPV vaccination. Methods At least six schools will be randomised to either an incentive intervention arm or a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> arm. Girls in <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> arm schools will receive the usual HPV vaccine programme invitation materials. Girls attending schools in the incentive intervention arm will receive the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> and will also be told that they will receive an incentive if they return their consent form (regardless of whether consent is granted or denied). The incentive is being entered into a prize draw to win a retail voucher. Feasibility objectives include estimating the schools??? and parents??? willingness {{to participate in the}} study and be randomised; response rates to questionnaires; the extent of missing data; the girls??? and parents??? attitudes towards the incentive offered; school staff experiences of participating, fidelity to the trial procedures, data on any unintended consequences and the possible mechanisms of action, and proof-of-concept evidence of the effect of the intervention on consent form return rates and uptake of the vaccine. Analysis of feasibility outcomes will primarily be descriptive. Consent form return rates and uptake of the vaccine will be presented by trial arm without comparison. Discussion Incentivising HPV vaccine consent form return may promote HPV vaccine uptake. This study will provide the evidence needed to establish whether testing this incentive intervention using a RCT design in the future is feasible...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{national}} programme {{of health}} checks to identify risk {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) is being rolled out but is encountering difficulties because of low uptake. Objective: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} an enhanced invitation method using the question-behaviour effect (QBE), with or without the offer of a financial incentive to return the QBE questionnaire, at increasing the uptake of health checks. The research went on to evaluate the reasons for the low uptake of invitations and compare the case mix for invited and opportunistic health checks. Design: Three-arm randomised trial and cohort study. Participants: All participants invited for a health check from 18 general practices. Individual participants were randomised. Interventions: (1) <b>Standard</b> health check <b>invitation</b> only; (2) QBE questionnaire followed by a standard invitation; and (3) QBE questionnaire with offer of a financial incentive to return the questionnaire, followed by a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation.</b> Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was completion of the health check within 6 months of invitation. A p-value of 0. 0167 was used for significance. In the cohort study of all health checks completed during the study period, the case mix was compared for participants responding to invitations and those receiving ‘opportunistic’ health checks. Participants were not aware that several types of invitation were in use. The research team were blind to trial arm allocation at outcome data extraction. Results: In total, 12, 459 participants were included in the trial and health check uptake was evaluated for 12, 052 participants for whom outcome data were collected. Health check uptake was as follows: <b>standard</b> <b>invitation,</b> 590 out of 4095 (14. 41 %); QBE questionnaire, 630 out of 3988 (15. 80 %); QBE questionnaire and financial incentive, 629 out of 3969 (15. 85 %). The increase in uptake associated with the QBE questionnaire was 1. 43 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 12 % to 2. 97 %; p = 0. 070] and the increase in uptake associated with the QBE questionnaire and offer of financial incentive was 1. 52 % (95 % CI - 0. 03 % to 3. 07 %; p = 0. 054). The difference in uptake associated with the offer of an incentive to return the QBE questionnaire was - 0. 01 % (95 % CI - 1. 59 % to 1. 58 %; p = 0. 995). During the study period, 58 % of health check cardiovascular risk assessments did not follow a trial invitation. People who received an ‘opportunistic’ health check had greater odds of a ≥ 10 % CVD risk than those who received an invited health check (adjusted odds ratio 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 45 to 1. 99; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Uptake of a health check following an invitation letter is low and is not increased through an enhanced invitation method using the QBE. The offer of a £ 5 incentive did not increase the rate of return of the QBE questionnaire. A high proportion of all health checks are performed opportunistically and not in response to a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> letter. Participants receiving opportunistic checks are at higher risk of CVD than those responding to <b>standard</b> <b>invitations.</b> Future research should aim to increase the accessibility of preventative medical interventions to increase uptake.

40|$|Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects up to 28 % of {{the adult}} {{population}} in Western countries. The detection and management of OSA by general practitioners (GPs) can be poor. The study aimed to examine what influence enhanced invitations had on uptake of on-line learning modules for OSA by GPs, and whether recent referrals of patients to sleep specialists influenced uptake. Methods: Practicing GPs in regional Australia were identified and randomised to receive either an enhanced or <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> letter to a new on-line education module for OSA. The enhanced letter included indication that the module was eligible for professional accreditation and described the prevalence and burden of sleep disorders. Some included extra emphasis if the GP had recently referred a patient for diagnostic investigation of OSA. Two reminder letters were sent. Results: Of 796 eligible GPs who received the letters, sixteen (2 %) accessed the website and four completed the modules over the four-month study period. GPs who received an enhanced invitation letter were not significantly more likely to access the website compared to GPs who received the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation</b> letter. Recent referral of a patient for diagnostic investigation was also not a significant factor in influencing use of the module. Conclusion: GP interest in on-line education about OSA appears low, and emphasis of relevant recent past patient(s) and the opportunity for professional education points was not successful in increasing engagement. There is a need to identify effective approaches to improving the detection and management of OSA in general practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: NHS Health Checks is a {{new program}} for primary {{prevention}} of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and vascular dementia in adults aged 40 to 74 years in England. Individuals without existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes are invited for a Health Check every 5 years. Uptake among those invited is lower than anticipated. Method: The project is a three-arm randomized controlled trial {{to test the hypothesis}} that enhanced invitation methods, using the Question-Behaviour Effect (QBE), will increase uptake of NHS Health Checks compared with a <b>standard</b> <b>invitation.</b> Participants comprise individuals eligible for an NHS Health Check registered in two London boroughs. Participants are randomized into one of three arms. Group A receives the standard NHS Health Check invitation letter, information sheet, and reminder letter at 12 weeks for nonattenders. Group B receives a QBE questionnaire 1 week before receiving the <b>standard</b> <b>invitation,</b> information sheet, and reminder letter where appropriate. Group C is the same as Group B, but participants are offered a £ 5 retail voucher if they return the questionnaire. Participants are randomized in equal proportions, stratified by general practice. The primary outcome is uptake of NHS Health Checks 6 months after invitation from electronic health records. We will estimate the incremental health service cost per additional completed Health Check for trial groups B and C versus trial arm A, as well as evaluating the impact of the QBE questionnaire, and questionnaire plus voucher, on the socioeconomic inequality in uptake of Health Checks. The trial includes a nested comparison of two methods for implementing allocation, one implemented manually at general practices and the other implemented automatically through the information systems used to generate invitations for the Health Check. Discussion: The research will provide evidence on whether asking individuals to complete a preliminary questionnaire, by using the QBE, is effective in increasing uptake of Health Checks and whether an incentive alters questionnaire return rates as well as uptake of Health Checks. The trial interventions can be readily translated into routine service delivery if they are shown to be cost-effective...|$|R
