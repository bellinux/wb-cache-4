50|$|Despite {{its modern}} shape, the body {{sat on a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} {{of wood and}} metal, resting on a {{traditional}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{power supply}} is often {{built in a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> from the amplifier.|$|R
50|$|Today {{some new}} {{vehicles}} {{still have a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis,</b> most commonly pickup trucks and their relatively low volume variants like SUVs.|$|R
50|$|All the Mark IVs {{were built}} on a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> frame with {{suspension}} by semi-elliptic leaf springs on rigid axles front and rear.|$|R
50|$|The T {{series is}} the first Bentley (or Rolls-Royce) without a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b> It is totally {{different}} from its predecessor the S series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> {{facilitated}} the adaptation {{of the car to}} a range of differing body shapes. On the other hand, the use of a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> with the frame rails running under the passenger compartment's floor during a period when automakers elsewhere in Europe were increasingly standardizing on self-supporting car bodies, left the Wartburg approach looking increasingly dated - and also added to the car's height, while [...] "low-long-sleek" [...] was becoming {{the order of the day}} in car styling.|$|R
50|$|Triumph Heralds were {{exported}} and {{assembled in}} a number of countries, and the <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> used as a jig to assemble kits exported from Coventry. These cars were referred to as CKD - Complete Knock Down cars.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1936 the Austin Goodwood 14 (of 16 tax horsepower) {{with its}} [...] "sound {{insulated}} coachwork" [...] took {{the place of}} the Twelve-Six saloons. The tourers remained available. The Goodwood was also available as a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car is {{made with}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> and bodywork. The {{aluminium}} chassis features double wishbone-style suspension. The suspension has no dampers and only act as linkage between the vehicle and the wheel enabling adjustments of ride height, camber and toe.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicles mounted HIGH on a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> {{are less}} likely to suffer damage from rust caused by dampness, mud, stones, road grit, water, snow, and other more serious damage like the {{transmission}} or engine oil sump damage often caused by rocks.|$|R
50|$|It is {{simpler to}} {{determine}} the effects of altering a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> than it is {{to determine the}} effects of altering a load-bearing unitized platform body. Coach builders have built models based on SUVs with a <b>separate</b> load-bearing <b>chassis.</b> The weight requirements of these limos do not meet some/most states Department of Motor Vehicle Rules and Regulations. Limousine manufacturers are often challenged to meet safety, exhaust, weight, and other standards with longer vehicles that hold more passengers (weight).|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies were}} also of great {{technical}} interest. Despite its size, the Dynamic offered little comfort to traditional coachbuilders, {{being the first}} French car in the luxury class to feature a steel body electrically welded together and constructed as a monocoque, without a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Phase III, {{released}} to the market for the mid-October 1955 Earls Court Motor Show, was a radical change with {{the elimination of the}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b> There was an overlap in availability of the old model with the Phase II estate continuing into 1956.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924 a new, more conventional, {{version was}} {{announced}} {{with the engine}} front mounted and the car much wider allowing side by side seating. A chain mounted centrally replaced the belt drive to the rear axle. The car now also had a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The GWR's first {{locomotives}} were {{specified by}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{but did not}} prove too successful. In order to meet his demands some novel ideas were tried such as the Haigh Foundry's geared locomotives and TE Harrison's Hurricane and Thunderer which had the engine and boiler on <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} Hillman the four-door body was {{mounted on a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> and was of the six-light design (three windows on each side) with a {{sunshine}} roof as standard. Suspension was independent at the front using a transverse leaf spring, and at the rear the axle had half-elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|Like the FX3, the FX4 had a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis,</b> {{but with}} {{independent}} front suspension and dual-circuit hydraulic brakes. The first FX4, registration number VLW 431, was delivered in July 1958 and went on test with York Way Motors. The official launch was later that year at the Commercial Motor Exhibition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rules were}} opened {{up for the}} second season, {{in keeping with the}} series' {{long-term}} plan to use a single car {{over the course of a}} race instead of two <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b> Teams are free to pursue their own development of the powertrain, including the e-motor, inverter, gearbox and cooling system.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars had}} a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> with {{independent}} suspension by coil springs {{at the front}} and a live axle with half-elliptical leaf springs at the rear. The brakes on early cars were operated by a hybrid hydro-mechanical system but became fully hydraulic in 1950. Girling disc brakes replaced drums at the front from October 1959.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advent of}} unibody construction, where the car body is unified with, and {{structurally}} {{integral to the}} chassis, made custom coachbuilding (in the traditional sense of putting a bespoke body on a factory supplied <b>separate</b> <b>chassis)</b> practically impossible. Many coachbuilders closed down, were bought by manufacturers or changed their core business to other activities: ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1937 car had a 1525 cc {{overhead}} camshaft, four-cylinder engine. The car had a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> {{that was}} conventional using beam axles and semi-elliptic leaf springs all round and hydraulic brakes. The wheels {{were of the}} pressed steel type. The car was available as a standard saloon, Super saloon (from 1938) or drophead coupe.|$|R
50|$|The first {{manufacturer}} to offer this new, and more economic design, for general sale was Sentinel of Shrewsbury, from 1947, their models being of integral construction, {{as was the}} Leyland-MCW Olympic which followed, in 1948. In 1949, the Associated Equipment Company launched its Regal IV chassis. In 1950, Leyland Motors introduced the Leyland Royal Tiger, also a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typically the {{material}} {{used to construct}} vehicle chassis and frames is carbon steel; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction. In {{the case of a}} <b>separate</b> <b>chassis,</b> the frame is made up of structural elements called the rails or beams. These are ordinarily made of steel channel sections, made by folding, rolling or pressing steel plate.|$|R
50|$|As {{the era of}} {{building}} cars on <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> was ending, {{and with it the}} market for complete bodies, Hooper completed the transition from wood-framed bodywork to bodies built over a skeleton of cast or extruded aluminium. Cast alloy was first used about 1933 in door and windscreen pillars where the 'fight' between roof and scuttle structures tended to cause cracking.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{derives from}} {{manufacturing}} practices before steel unibody monocoques [...] - [...] when automobile bodies {{were made by}} outside firms on a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> with an engine, suspension, and fenders attached. The manufacturers built or purchased wooden bodies (with thin, non-structural metal sheets on the outside) to bolt onto the frame. The bodies were painted white prior to the final color.|$|R
50|$|The Isabella was {{constructed}} without a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis,</b> applying the monocoque technique which during the 1950s was becoming the norm. Like its predecessor, {{the car was}} designed with a modern ponton, three-box design, but {{the line of the}} Isabella was more curvaceous than that of the first Hansa, and the car’s body made greater use of chrome trim. Ground clearance was 6.9".|$|R
50|$|It is {{available}} as the N UB (N230UB, N270UB, N280UB) two-axle single-decker bus, the N UA tri-axle articulated bus, and the N UD (N230UD, N250UD, N260UD, N270UD, N280UD) two-axle double-decker bus. The double-decker variant is mainly built {{for use in}} the United Kingdom, and {{is available}} both as an integral product known as the Scania OmniCity, and as a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> with Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Still at {{this time}} {{considered}} advanced was the car’s monocoque steel bodied construction (without a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis),</b> the rigidity of which was enhanced in 1959 through the addition of reinforcing box section lengths {{on each side of}} the floor section. The front wheels were independently sprung and the rear suspension followed the usual pattern of the time, combining a rigid rear axle with leaf springing.|$|R
50|$|Stout {{designed}} the Scarab in strong contrast to contemporary production cars that commonly used a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> and body; {{with a long}} front, with engine compartment and engine located longitudinally behind the front axle, and a rearward passenger compartment. The front-mounted engine typically drove the rear axle through a connecting drive shaft running underneath {{the floor of the}} vehicle. This layout worked well, but had space limitations.|$|R
5000|$|The car had a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> and all {{independent}} suspension using coil springs {{at the front}} and torsion bars at the rear. At introduction it {{was believed to be}} the only all-independently sprung British car. [...] The Lockheed brakes had 12 in drums at the front and 11 in at the rear with the latter being mounted inboard. Rack and pinion steering was used.|$|R
50|$|MC-LAG, or Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group, {{is a type}} of link {{aggregation}} group (LAG) with constituent ports that terminate on <b>separate</b> <b>chassis,</b> {{primarily for}} the purpose of providing redundancy in the event one of the chassis fails. The IEEE 802.1AX-2008 industry standard for link aggregation does not mention MC-LAG, but does not preclude it. Its implementation varies by vendor; notably, the protocol existing between the chassis is proprietary.|$|R
50|$|The Alfa Romeo 1900 is an {{automobile}} produced by Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo from 1950 to 1959. Designed by Orazio Satta, {{it was an}} important development for Alfa Romeo as the marque's first car built entirely on a production line and first production car without a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.</b> It was also the first Alfa Romeo offered with left-hand drive. The car was introduced at the 1950 Paris Motor Show.|$|R
5000|$|The steam wagon came in {{two basic}} forms. The overtype designs {{looked like a}} cross between a {{traction}} engine and a lorry. The front resembled a traction engine by having a cab built around a horizontal fire-tube boiler with a round smokebox and chimney (e.g. Foden). The back resembled a lorry in having a load-carrying body and being built around a chassis. (A traction engine is constructed around the boiler and has no <b>separate</b> <b>chassis.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Singer's SM1500 had a pressed-steel body {{mounted on}} a <b>separate</b> <b>chassis</b> with at the front a Packard {{designed}} coil springs independent suspension built under licence. The brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system with 9 in drums. The four-speed gearbox had a column change which made it difficult or impossible to select second and reverse. [...] "Many an exasperated driver rammed his knuckles into the mock-wood-painted metal dashboard in the attempt".|$|R
5000|$|F-series [...] - [...] 2111F, 2117F (red line on front panel; F for Floating point Processor in a <b>separate</b> 2U <b>chassis)</b> ...|$|R
