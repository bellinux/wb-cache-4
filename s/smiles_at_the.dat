Grandpa Lou finds them after getting some snacks from the concession stand (he comments on the mess the babies caused, telling Larry and Steve how in his time {{they knew how to}} keep a work place clean). Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without <b>Smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E

500|$|... "The Little Drummer Boy", {{based on}} an ancient Czech folksong, was written by Katherine K. Davis in 1957. [...] The song tells the {{apocryphal}} story of a poor young boy who, unable to afford a gift for the infant Jesus, plays his drum with Mary's approval. The baby <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boy in gratitude. The 1958 version by the Harry Simeone Chorale is the standard, and hit the unparalleled record of placing in the Top 40 for five straight Christmases in a row. Simeone recorded the song in a Greenwich Village cathedral {{to give it a}} hushed respect. Its highest position on both the US and UK charts was #13.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and complimented the choreography saying Spears had not danced with so much conviction since the In the Zone era. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse likened the video's choreography and dancer's wardrobe to Janet Jackson's [...] "Feedback" [...] video. Jocelyn Vena of MTV gave the video a positive review, stating that it's a [...] "sexy, fast-paced clip" [...] and that [...] "there are a few moments in the video where Britney's personality shines" [...] adding that [...] "she <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> song's [...] lyrics, particularly when she finishes the song's bridge." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly complimented the video's choice of wardrobe, but said that the video was [...] "sparse", adding [...] "there's not much to the single besides trite, ridiculous advocation for a ménage à trois anyway, so why would the video go any deeper?". The Daily Mail said the video [...] "features Britney writhing around in scantily-clad outfits with male dancers {{in the best way}} she knows how".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E

60|$|Nothing {{could have}} been less expected. In the {{beginning}} of May its leaves had lost something of their greenness.

60|$|At a quadrille party, the bashful young gentleman always {{remains as}} near the {{entrance}} of the room as possible, from which position he <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> people he knows as they come in, and sometimes steps forward to shake hands with more intimate friends: a process which on each repetition seems to turn him a deeper scarlet than before. He declines dancing the first set or two, observing, in a faint voice, that he would rather wait a little; but at length is absolutely compelled to allow himself to be introduced to a partner, when he is led, in a great heat and blushing furiously, across the room to a spot where half-a-dozen unknown ladies are congregated together.|$|E

Muriel, in return, smiled her most gracious and girlish recognition. As the bride drew near, she couldn't refrain from bending forward a little to look at the girl's really graceful costume. As she did so, the skirt of her own European dress brushed for a second against the bride's train, trailed carelessly many yards on the ground behind her.|$|E

60|$|Young Calidore is {{paddling}} o'er the lake; His healthful spirit {{eager and}} awake To feel {{the beauty of}} a silent eve, Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave; The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.
