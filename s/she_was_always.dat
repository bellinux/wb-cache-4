5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E

5|$|The Duke of Kent died quite {{suddenly}} in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third {{in line to}} the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, {{both of whom were}} well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the services of a governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen – as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> known in the household – took over five-year-old Victoria's care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes.|$|E
25|$|Youngen {{earned her}} {{doctorate}} {{degree from the}} Ohio State University in 1971 while maintaining a leadership role on campus. A true competitor, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> one {{to take on a}} challenge, whether it entailed racing one of her male students in the 1970s, or pushing for recreational programs to be open to the community in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|On May 4, 1960, {{just two}} months after filming that episode (the final episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour), the couple divorced. Until his death in 1986, however, Arnaz and Ball {{remained}} friends and often spoke very fondly of each other. Her real-life divorce indirectly {{found its way into}} her later television series, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> cast as an unmarried woman.|$|E

25|$|Lopez {{was growing}} {{surrounded}} by shoes and everything related to shoe production. Her observations {{and attention to}} the techniques gave her deep knowledge of the shoe construction and design concepts. Later, in the interview for the Spanish Magazine Surrealista, Lopez admitted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> attracted by art and creative process but she never really thought to work neither in the shoe industry nor in fashion.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the winter of 1929, the winters from 1927 until 1939 were relatively mild. Since Jääkarhu was the most expensive to operate among the Finnish state-owned icebreakers, she saw little action during these years as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the last icebreaker to leave, beginning her season Helsinki and then moving to Hanko, and the first one to return. During very mild winters she was not put into service at all.|$|E
25|$|She {{was named}} after her {{paternal}} great-grandmother Queen Victoria; her paternal grandmother, Alexandra, Princess of Wales; and her maternal grandmother, Princess Mary of Teck. Since she had the same birthday as her deceased great-aunt Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, the name Alice was added in. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> known by {{the last of her}} Christian names, Mary. She was fifth in the line of succession {{at the time of her}} birth.|$|E

25|$|The {{time came}} for the birth and an {{extraordinary}} daughter {{was born in the}} place called Kyetrag Thang. There were numerous auspicious signs and her body was of purest white and radiating rays of light. As a small child <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> reciting the mantra of Tara and at the age of three she was teaching the mantra to others. She grew quickly and was incredibly beautiful. Her parents died when she was quite young and she then stayed with her uncle.|$|E
25|$|When she {{returned}} to Kristiania and found a home at Elisenbergveien she still had contact with her social network. Her home was open for family and friends. Among the visitors were theatre critic Sigurd Bødtker, who eventually moved in with her, Olaf Bull, Nils Kjær, Helge Krog, Ronald Fangen, Sigurd Hoel, Nini Roll Anker, Oda Krohg, Hulda Garborg, Sigrid Undset, Jens Thiis and Sven Elvestad. The group regularly met at the restaurant Anden Etage at Hotel Continental. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> carefully dressed, often with self-designed costumes and hats.|$|E
25|$|HMS King Edward VII, {{named after}} King Edward VII, {{was the lead}} ship of her class of Royal Navy pre-dreadnought battleships. She was {{commissioned}} in 1905, and entered service with the Atlantic Fleet as Flagship, Commander-in-chief (by request of the King, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{to serve as a}} flagship). Rendered obsolete in 1906 with the commissioning of the revolutionary , she underwent a refit in 1907, following which she was assigned to the Channel Fleet and then to the Home Fleet. In 1912, she, together with her sister ships, formed the 3rd Battle Squadron.|$|E

25|$|Actress Elizabeth Hendrickson debuted on All My Children in 2001 as {{character}} Frankie Stone. The character was killed off after {{only three months}} on the series. Her death attracted criticism when viewers reasoned that the show was afraid to portray a homosexual romance, one that was blossoming with Frankie's developing relationship with out-and-proud lesbian Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel). When creator of the character, Richard Culliton, stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> intended to die, it did not help ease the discontent viewers expressed about her demise. As a result, Maggie Stone, the character's identical twin sister, was created {{in order to bring}} Hendrickson back to the series.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Googoosh began a {{meteoric}} rise to {{fame and}} success {{as she drove}} the edge of Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop culture hungry fans in Iran and abroad with her trademark hairdos and hip-elegant style. Iranian women changed hairdos with Googoosh and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{one step ahead of}} them with a new look. Her music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given an Arabic-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, which at times edged towards chanson and Édith Piaf territory. She starred in over 25 movies, one of which was to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E
25|$|Jääkarhu {{was also}} the most {{powerful}} steam-powered icebreaker ever commissioned in Finland. Her three triple-expansion steam engines, two with a maximum continuous rating of 2,500 ihp driving four-bladed nickel steel propellers weighing about 11 tons each in the stern at 120 rpm, and one turning a third propeller {{of the same size}} in the bow at 130 rpm with a maximum continuous rating of 2,600 ihp. However, for short periods of time during icebreaking operations, the combined output of the engines could reach 9,200 ihp. Unlike the previous coal-burning icebreakers, Jääkarhu had eight oil-fired boilers with mechanical ventilation that consumed 2.5 to 4.5 tons of fuel oil per hour. Although she was the most expensive to operate, and for that reason <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the last one to enter service and first one to sail back to her summer moorings, her endurance and range were considerably better than those of the older icebreakers since she could hold nearly 1,000 tons of fuel and required refueling only two or three times during normal winters.|$|E

500|$|The {{photographer}} Charles Brittin, {{who knew}} Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her [...] "a sweet {{person with a}} great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having [...] "many different crowds of friends, and I {{think she was a}} different personality with each crowd... She wasn't an even personality at all, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a very gracious person." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{grandchild}} of the British monarch, she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Edinburgh. Within her family, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> known as [...] "Ducky". At {{the time of}} her birth, she was 10th in the line of succession to the British throne. The princess was christened on 1 January 1877 at San Antonio Palace by a Royal Navy chaplain. Her godparents included her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria, who was represented by a proxy.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} of the song portrayed Madonna in the classic submissive female positions, while writhing in passion on an empty road, for her lover who appeared to come from her behind on a car. The video ended showing Madonna driving the car instead, thereby concluding that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in charge. Many authors noted that the [...] "Burning Up" [...] music video was a beginning of Madonna's depiction of her taking control of a destabilized male sexuality.|$|E
