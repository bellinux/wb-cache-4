50|$|To {{measure the}} depth of shallow waters, boatmen used a <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> {{containing}} fathom points, some marked and others in between, called deeps, unmarked but estimated by the user. Water near the coast and not too deep to be fathomed by a hand <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> {{was referred to as}} in soundings or on soundings. The area offshore beyond the 100 fathom line, too deep to be fathomed by a hand <b>sounding</b> <b>line,</b> was referred to as out of soundings or off soundings. A deep-sea lead, the heaviest of sounding leads, was used in water exceeding 100 fathoms in depth.|$|R

After 20 of her {{personnel}} attended Radiation and Decontamination School, she departed California on 20 April 1962 and conducted an investigation of Pacific waters which had seen recent underwater nuclear tests, including water temperature measurements, chemical analyses, measurements of radioactivity and of the different elements making up the radioactive water {{in the area of}} an underwater nuclear explosion, and study of the effects of radioactivity on plant and animal life in and near the test areas. She completed the project on 25 June 1962 and returned to California, arriving at Oakland. She had conducted gravimetric measurements continuously throughout the voyage.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{legends and}} folk tales {{refer to the}} Blautopf. Its {{characteristic}} colour was explained by the account that every day someone would pour a vat of ink into the Blautopf.

50|$|On 11 February 1964, Pioneer {{departed}} California {{to begin}} the 1964 field season. After completing the calibration of her gravity meter, she began a deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> to Hawaii on 13 February 1964, making hydrographic, magnetic, gravity, and bathythermograph observations, plankton tows, and biological productivity hauls along the way.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> or {{lead line}} is a length of thin rope with a plummet, {{generally}} of lead, at its end. Regardless of the actual composition of the plummet, it is still called a [...] "lead." [...] Leads were swung, or cast, by a leadsman, usually standing in the chains of a ship, up against the shrouds.|$|R
50|$|The word {{sounding}} is {{used for}} all types of depth measurements, including those that don't use sound, and is unrelated in origin to the word sound in the sense of noise or tones. Echo sounding is a more rapid method of measuring depth than the previous technique of lowering a <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> until it touched bottom.|$|R
50|$|Pioneer {{departed}} the U.S. West Coast in April 1947 for {{her first}} assignment, which was hydrographic survey work in the Aleutian Islands. She spent the field seasons of 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950 in the Aleutians, also running <b>sounding</b> <b>lines</b> from points in the Aleutians across the Gulf of Alaska and North Pacific Ocean to points on the U.S. West Coast.|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of strong-motion {{records of the}} 1966 Parkfield earthquake and the 1952 Taft earthquake indicates that the usable limit of long period of velocity and displacement, calculated by integration of the accelerogram rec-ords, is restricted mainly by human reading and base <b>line</b> <b>correction</b> errors. Base <b>line</b> <b>correction</b> errors arise from uncertainties in the coefficients of the fitted straight base line. Calculation by the jackknife method of the variances of the errors in displacement records from linear base <b>line</b> <b>corrections</b> indicates that these errors are more pronounced in the long-period (above 7 sec) range than errors from digitization. The records analyzed in this paper indicate that long-period limits due to the combined errors vary between 7 and 14 sec. Beyond these limits components of displacement spectra from the present analog accelerograms are not reliable measures of ground motion...|$|R
50|$|Early depth {{sounding}} {{was achieved}} using lead <b>line</b> <b>sounding</b> (or <b>sounding</b> <b>line),</b> where a lead weight {{attached to a}} length of rope marked with depth values. As this method was mechanical in nature, the only correction that {{was applied to the}} sounding was the reduction of the sounding for tidal height. In the mid 20th century, sonar systems were developed to allow the measurement of underwater distances using the two way travel time of an acoustic pulse. This allowed the surveyor to take many more soundings in a given period of time and was less labor intensive than using a lead line.|$|R
5000|$|Pioneer put to sea {{again on}} 6 February 1963 to resume her {{survey of the}} North Pacific and run trials for her gravity meter. Between 7 and 14 February she ran a deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> into the survey area in the North Pacific, then {{continued}} survey work she had left incomplete in 1961, including weather observations, almost continuous use of her gravity meter and magnetometer, and deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>lines</b> from Hawaii to San Francisco and return that each crossed the gravity meter test range. After a port call, she put to sea again on 1 May 1963, making Nansen bottle casts, collecting bottom samples [...] - [...] including a seven-foot (2.1-meter) core sample taken {{at a depth of}} 22,170 feet (5,822 meters) in the Aleutian Trench [...] - [...] studying currents with drift bottles and a geomagnetic electrokinematograph, photographing the ocean bottom, and taking bathythermograph measurements. She also assisted the United States Air Force by deploying and recovering a mock-up of the Project Mercury space capsule off of Oahu so that the Air Force could practice parachuting men and equipment into the Pacific to place a flotation collar around it. She called at Kodiak from 27 to 31 May 1963, then returned to the North Pacific to continue her survey project, operating near 161 degrees West longitude between 39 degrees and 54 degrees North latitude. She discovered a 10,080-foot-tall (3,072-meter-tall) seamount in general depths of 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) at [...] before departing the area on 13 June 1963 to run a deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> to California, calibrating her gravity meter on the San Francisco test range along the way, and she berthed at Oakland on 18 June 1963.|$|R
50|$|Pioneer {{made another}} voyage to the North Pacific survey grounds {{later in the}} 1963 field season, {{calibrating}} her gravity meter, making gravimetric measurements, and experimenting with the design of Nansen bottles, bathythermograph collection speeds, {{the use of a}} thermoprobe at a depth of 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) and the use of a sea sled to capture specimens. She concluded the 1963 season with a deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> run from Honolulu to Oakland.|$|R
