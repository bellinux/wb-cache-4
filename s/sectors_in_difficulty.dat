This success, {{uncommon in}} poverty-ridden West Africa, {{became known as}} the [...] "Ivorian miracle" [...] and was due to a combination of sound planning, the maintenance of strong ties with the West (particularly France), and development of the country's significant coffee and cocoa industries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether restructuring <b>in</b> {{the public}} <b>sector</b> {{contributed to the}} slower cyclical recovery in Canada than in the United States during the 1990 s. Changes <b>in</b> public <b>sector</b> employment are used to investigate this question. The pressures {{that led up to}} the restructuring are explored and the resulting changes in employment are documented. A standardized definition of the public sector is proposed that allows for a consistent comparison of changes in employment in Canada with those of the United States. These changes are examined by level of government and by function. The analysis reveals that, in Canada, changes in employment in the "standardized" public sector were negative during much of the 1990 s, in contrast to the continued, steady expansion of this <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> the United States. Evidence presented from longitudinal surveys indicates that certain workers who were displaced from the public <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> Canada experienced <b>difficulties</b> regaining employment. A key conclusion is that public sector restructuring contributed to the slower recovery in employment in Canada in the 1990 s. Labour markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} flexicurity when jobs must be reallocated from a declining, traditional sector to a skill intensive expanding sector. Workers initially decide whether to acquire qualifications for skill-intensive tasks or to accept a less demanding traditional job. Unemployment arises from job separation <b>in</b> the declining <b>sector</b> and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> retraining for new employment <b>in</b> the expanding <b>sector.</b> The paper derives an optimal welfare policy which combines {{the design of the}} tax schedule with three pillars of `flexicurity'. The optimal policy includes (i) a progressive wage tax schedule; (ii) a wage subsidy to re-employed workers; (iii) unemployment insurance; (iv) moderate job protection; and (v) active labor market policy to facilitate job reallocation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the coming}} twenty-first century, it is urgent {{to build up}} a solid, mutual support system between {{the public and private sectors}} of social welfare in order to meet the various needs the people. Due to {{inequality}} between the public and private sectors, however the private <b>sector</b> has <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> taking their own initiative, which prevents them from making the best use of their institutional advantages. At the same time, the private sector is not making enough effort in order to obtain their independence. In other words, they are still largely depending on the public <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> many aspects. In order to establish a mutual and solid support system for the coming century, it is necessary to define the role of public and private sectors clear so that both of the sectors can fully perform their duties with respect to each sectors initiatives and characteristics. This paper makes proposal for a new relationship between public and private sectors of social welfare, considering the latest reform of social welfare and the problems related to the both sectors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{emerging}} {{countries in}} recent decades have relied on a development strategy that focused primarily on promoting the manufacturing sector and the exports of manufactured goods. However, an acceleration of growth of output and employment in manufacturing has eluded India. This is {{despite the fact that}} the central focus of the reforms in the 1980 s and 1990 s was to unshackle the manufacturing sector. Instead it is the services sector which has grown rapidly, contributing about two-third of GDP growth in recent years. This paper discusses the reasons behind the modest performance of the manufacturing <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> India post reforms. It argues that there are many factors that have inhibited the growth of industrial <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> India. One major factor is the rigid and strict labor laws which have affected the industrial performance in a number of ways, by keeping the size of the establishments small, by not encouraging the production of labor intensive goods, by pushing activities to the unorganized sector, and by keeping the Indian industry uncompetitive. Besides the labor laws other factors that are responsible for the modest performance of the manufacturing <b>sector</b> include <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> the acquisition of land for industrial use, inadequate financing and infrastructure, and cumbersome business climate. The paper presents arguments and evidence which shows the importance of these factors. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} relationship between education and the labor market for adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa. The human capital theory is used to examine this relationship. This research used scientific literature, policy documents and interviews with representatives of different <b>sectors.</b> <b>Difficulties</b> <b>in</b> this relationship exist on both the side of education {{as well as on}} the side of the labor market. There is a mismatch between the supply of education and the demand of the labor market in the current context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, attention is paid to skills and the attitude which adolescents must possess when making the transition to the labor market. Further, attention is paid to initiatives that exist to improve this relationship. A case study of the NICHE program sheds light on this relationship and reveals how they link education and training to the demand of the labor market.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the theme of}} the special issue by drawing attention to ways in which gender scholarship can influence management and organizational studies in an analysis of the pathways to senior management. Based on an Australia-wide study of the experiences of women and men in senior management, it adds new empirical data to the body of knowledge on women's career advancement at senior levels of organizations. Many women interviewed expressed reticence and ambivalence about the advancement of their careers and their prospects for promotion, which was called 'girl disease' by one woman. Forms of ambivalence varied according to different age and <b>sector</b> cohorts; <b>in</b> particular <b>difficulties</b> were identified <b>in</b> reconciling family responsibilities with the demands of senior level appointments. We analyse expressions of ambivalence and reticence by exploring the tension between women's gender identity and the organizational factors that shape their 'managerial' identity. We conclude by suggesting strategies to improve organizational practices in relation to women's career development and promotion. 14 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Higher pre-crisis {{proportions}} of low-skilled in the labour force—defined {{as the number}} of low skilled (employed and unemployed) divided by the total labour force—seem to be an important precondition for a persistent outward shift of a country’s Beveridge curve. 18 One possible explanation is that sectors with a large amount of low-skilled workers were especially hard hit during the crisis (for instance construction {{and to a lesser extent}} manufacturing). Restructuring of these <b>sectors</b> and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> reallocating labour to other sectors can lead to permanent losses in employment. However, it should be noted that the impulse response function moves into insignificant territory at the end of our sample, indicating that the share of low-skilled workers is unlikely to be the driver behind a permanent shift of the Beveridge curve.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is a {{participatory}} design process that is used as a means to enable multiple stakeholders' collaboration in discussing strategies, designs and solutions of a conceptual future factory. The reason for this study is the Swedish industrial <b>sector's</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> attracting women and young people. The design process can adapt to various complexities, building on the creative and innovative ability of collaborating people. In the present study, young people participated in explorations of images and perceptions of the current industrial <b>sector</b> and <b>in</b> an inquiry into the needs and preferences of a future factory. This activity resulted in two future scenarios: utopia, a positive future vision, and dystopia, a pessimistic outlook. These scenarios subsequently were used as means for critical reflection with multiple industrial sector stakeholders, exploring the future gap as the discrepancy between the images, perceptions and understanding held by internal stakeholders compared to external stakeholders. In this paper, we propose scenario-based design as one approach to multi-stakeholder activities, both for understanding various stakeholder needs and preferences and for critical reflection on future strategies and visions with a diversity of stakeholders. We believe {{there is a need for}} a transformation in the way in which organisations involve and connect to stakeholders. Validerad; 2011; 20110817 (asawi...|$|R
