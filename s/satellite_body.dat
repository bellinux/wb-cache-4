50|$|Junior {{returns to}} the Amaterasu Server to defeat the final two chiefs, and gains access to Amaterasu City. He leads a fresh attack on the Amaterasu Admin Center, leading to the MAGAMI President being defeated. Junior then uses the central {{computer}} to destroy Destromon, before returning to Asuka to ask Airdramon to help him in lifting the virus which is affecting {{most of the players}} by transforming them into Oinkmon. Before long, the Oinkmon virus returns and strikes most of the players, with only Junior and Kail surviving untouched. Vemmon had used the beam containing the Oinkmon virus and shot the beam through all servers. Junior then goes into the admin center, and in the Master Room, Junior is challenged by an entity calling himself Lord Megadeath. Junior then travels to a military satellite, Gunslinger, to challenge Lord Megadeath. Once close to the control room, Junior battles Armaggeddemon, and defeats it. He then reaches the control room, and battles Lord Megadeath. Lord Megadeath is defeated, but succeeds in his project of creating Snatchmon, by combining four Vemmon. Snatchmon absorbs Lord Megadeath, challenges the player, and merges with the Gunslinger to become Galacticmon- its ultimate goal being to merge with the Earth to become an unimaginably powerful Gaiamon. Junior defeats him, and Galacticmon's <b>satellite</b> <b>body</b> falls to Earth, burning up into a meteor shower in the atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|BLITS (Ball Lens In The Space) is a Russian {{satellite}} {{launched on}} September 17, 2009, as a secondary payload on a Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.The satellite is totally passive and spherical, and is tracked using {{satellite laser ranging}} by the International Laser Ranging Service. The purpose of the mission is experimental verification of the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept as well as obtaining SLR data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity [...] The design of BLITS {{is based on the}} optical Luneburg lens concept. The retroreflector is a multilayer glass sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights. A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the METEOR-3M spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.The <b>satellite</b> <b>body</b> consists of two outer hemispheres (radius 85.16 mm) made of a low-refraction-index glass and an inner ball lens (radius 53.52 mm) made of a high-refraction-index glass; the two outer hemispheres and the inner ball are glued together, and one of the outer hemispheres is externally coated with a reflective coating, covered with a protective varnish. The total mass is 7.53 kg.The satellite was inserted into an 832 km Sun-synchronous orbit, with an inclination of 98.85º. The satellite was spinning at a spin period of 5.6 seconds around the axis normal to its orbit plane, allowing laser light to be reflected in short bursts because only half of the satellite is covered in a reflective coating. Being the satellite made of glass, minimum in-flight slowdown of spin rate was expected, as there were no conducting parts where currents interacting with the Earth magnetic field can be induced.The expected operative life was at least 5 years, but the mission was interrupted in 2013 after a collision with space debris.|$|E

It is shown that photoelectrons, created on the boom, could be engulfed in the electrostatic field of the highly charged <b>satellite</b> main <b>body.</b> Theoretical calculations made using a simple current balance model showed that these electrons could provide a substantial discharging current to the main body and cause the observed variations in the potential difference between the main body and the booms...|$|R

A triaxial fluxgate magnetometer aligned with a star imager and an Overhauser magnetometer are mounted on an 8 meter long deployable boom.

Each accelerometer keeps a cubic proof-mass levitated {{in the center of a}} slightly larger cavity (Fedosov and Pereštý 2011; Zadražil 2011).

The control voltages are representative for the acceleration of the proof-mass relative to the cavity.

40|$|Attitude {{information}} is acquired by detecting Earth’s infrared electromagnetic radiation and, subsequently, determining the region obscured by Earth in the sensors’ fields of view to compute a nadir vector estimation in the <b>satellite’s</b> <b>body</b> frame. Due {{to the limited}} computational resources and source code modification ability of most small satellites on orbit, a compact and robust EHS solution is required to efficiently achieve high-accuracy attitude knowledge. This paper presents the analytic form and simulated model of an attitude estimation method to compute a nadir vector using inputs from infrared EHS with Gaussian response characteristics. The proposed method can be applied when two sensors, each with known and distinct pointing directions, detect the horizon, which is defined as having their fields of view partially obscured by Earth. The accuracy of the estimation was quantified through simulations to be approximately 0. 2 o for a satellite in low-Earth orbit under a maximum attitude disturbance level of 4 o. The sensitivity of the estimation accuracy relative to mounting uncertainty was also analyzed, yielding an additional error of 0. 7 o on nadir vector estimation for every 0. 25 o of boresight offset...|$|R
40|$|During space {{exposure}} {{solar cell}} arrangements and cover shields of satellites {{are subject to}} intense bombardement by natural and man-made debris which causes impact craters and other damage on the surfaces. In order to calibrate particle impact properties of retrieved material a number of defined projectiles were shot under controlled conditions at samples of solar cells and thermal Multi-Layer-Insulation (MLI) blankets identical to those used on ESA's "EURECA " satellite. In each sample, crater morphology and impact residues were determined in detail by optical microscopy and electron microprobe.
