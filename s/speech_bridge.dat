They assessed their bridges – the overall quality, aesthetics, speech, chewing and the health of the gingiva by the scale from 1 – 5. The same categories were also assessed by a trained prosthodontist. The majority of the patients was really satisfied and gave the highest grades (quality, aesthetics, speech, etc.) and therefore the results were skewed and asymmetrical towards the biggest scores (biggest grades).

I prefer the word "pure" for the translation of properties of doves, which (in my opinion) aptly expresses the importance of both textual variants without the negative connotations of the word "simple" (as naive or stupid).

40|$|Speech {{interfaces}} {{have become}} widely used and are integrated in many applications and devices. However, speech interfaces require {{the user to}} produce intelligible speech, which might be hindered by loud environments, concern to bother bystanders or the general in- ability to produce speech due to disabilities. Decoding a usera s imagined speech instead of actual speech would solve this problem. Such a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on imagined speech would enable fast and natural communication without the need to actually speak out loud. These interfaces could provide a voice to otherwise mute people. This dissertation investigates BCIs based on speech processes using functional Near In- frared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electrocorticography (ECoG), two brain activity imaging modalities on opposing ends of an invasiveness scale. Brain activity data have low signal- to-noise ratio and complex spatio-temporal and spectral coherence. To analyze these data, techniques from the areas of machine learning, neuroscience and Automatic Speech Recog- nition are combined in this dissertation to facilitate robust classification of detailed speech processes while simultaneously illustrating the underlying neural processes. fNIRS is an imaging modality based on cerebral blood flow. It only requires affordable hardware and {{can be set up}} within minutes in a day-to-day environment. Therefore, it is ideally suited for convenient user interfaces. However, the hemodynamic processes measured by fNIRS are slow in nature and the technology therefore offers poor temporal resolution. We investigate speech in fNIRS and demonstrate classification of speech processes for BCIs based on fNIRS. ECoG provides ideal signal properties by invasively measuring electrical potentials artifact- free directly on the brain surface. High spatial resolution and temporal resolution down to millisecond sampling provide localized information with accurate enough timing to capture the fast process underlying speech production. This dissertation presents the Brain-to- Text system, which harnesses automatic speech recognition technology to decode a textual representation of continuous speech from ECoG. This could allow to compose messages or to issue commands through a BCI. While the decoding of a textual representation is unparalleled for device control and typing, direct communication is even more natural if the full expressive power of speech - including emphasis and prosody - could be provided. For this purpose, a second system is presented, which directly synthesizes neural signals into audible speech, which could enable conversation with friends and family through a BCI. Up to now, both systems, the Brain-to-Text and synthesis system are operating on audibly produced <b>speech.</b> To <b>bridge</b> the gap to the final frontier of neural prostheses based on imagined speech processes, we investigate the differences between audibly produced and imagined speech and present first results towards BCI from imagined speech processes. This dissertation demonstrates the usage of speech processes as a paradigm for BCI for the first time. Speech processes offer a fast and natural interaction paradigm which will help patients and healthy users alike to communicate with computers and with friends and family efficiently through BCIs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Speech</b> is a <b>bridge</b> {{to every}} aspect of a child's life, {{therefore}} I {{think it is important}} to understand how it develops. Children are naturally eager, willing and able to acquire speech and language and in the first six years of life acquire the basics of communication that will benefit them for life. It is known that children produce as much speech as they hear it. This means that a child who only hears and adopts partially and deformed sounds, also speaks less and worse. During the study my interest has deepened in Speech and Language Therapy, in addition to that I got inspired for my dissertation from my father, who is hard of hearing. We raise and educate hard of hearing child so that he will be able to find knowledge and use it in life. We must trust in him, his development and his abilities. This is the foundation so we are able to empathize with the child and encourage him. We offer a professional and personal willingness so with the reflection of our own work can help the child in its development. For this, there is only one way, namely practice. Therefore, in my Bachelor's degree I explored how teachers and teacher assistants encourage speech, language and communication in hard of hearing and hearing children. The research involved fifty teachers and teacher assistants from three Slovenian nursery schools. Aforementioned teachers and teacher assistants responded to the questionnaire on the use of activities in the curriculum area of language, frequency of use of speech games and exercises, how to implement them, the evaluation of the importance of influencing speech games and exercises and they spoke about the importance of games and exercises for hard of hearing and hearing children. I analysed date on the basis of two groups of participants in the survey, namely teachers and teacher assistants who have experience with hard of hearing children and teachers and teacher assistants who do not have experience with hard of hearing children. I found out that most of teachers and teacher assistants, regardless of whether they have experience with hard of hearing children or not, use all language activities listed from the curriculum. In addition, the groups unify in influencing games and exercises, since they most want to influence on child's articulation and their opinion is that the speech exercises and games are important for hard of hearing as well as hearing children...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the way to}} combine navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) with electrophysiological techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalo­graphy (MEG). This technical and neurophysiological possibility allows the assessment of cortical excitability and functional connectivity with the advantage of high spatiotemporal resolution. Investigation of these cortical network properties can lead in deeper understanding of sensorimotor and <b>speech</b> networks and <b>bridge</b> the gap between basic research and clinical applications by means of TMS. First, we examined whether nTMS–EEG {{can be used as}} a marker of cortical excitability changes by investigating the reproducibility of EEG after TMS. We showed that reproducibility is a feature of TMS-evoked EEG responses if the parameters of the stimulation and coil orientation are kept the same. Utilization of navigation is crucial for such test–retest paradigms. The second part of the thesis elaborated the effect of neuronal state prior to TMS on cortico–cortical excitability. We demonstrated modulation of excitability not only of the contra- but also of the ipsilateral hemisphere during preparation and execution of unilateral movements. We also tested the methodology to measure the time onset of cortical activation by grading the levels of its modulation with TMS–EEG. Next, we utilized MEG to detect sensorimotor cortical sources. nTMS was used to target these sources and modulate their activity during a motor task after a sensory stimulation. We demonstrated that stimulation of the secondary somatosensory cortex can influence the primary one and amplify somatosensory processing. By this study, we set the methodological standards on how to use nTMS and MEG in mapping the sensorimotor cortex. Therefore, we applied our experience in presurgical mapping of epileptic patients before cortical resection. By combining the nTMS and MEG advantages, we created a noninvasive methodology to map the sensorimotor cortex. The results were as accurate as electrical cortical stimulation in most patients. Thus, it may be possible to replace costly invasive standard procedures, which pose a high risk for the patient, when the epileptic focus is near sensorimotor cortex and accessible to MEG. This motivated us to create another nTMS paradigm for mapping speech-related areas. We combined an object naming paradigm and repetitive TMS to find cortical sites sensitive to interference during the task. We recorded video of the experiment to evaluate the effect of TMS on the subjects’ performance. The results show that this method may map speech-related areas successfully. All in all, we show that recent advances in TMS set new standards in basic research and clinical applications, such as preoperative work- up and test–retest pharmacological studies. Cross-modal nTMS applications open new avenues in studying cortical network parameters...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Norway between the period of August and December 2012. The study is focused on {{communication}} between children with cochlear implants (CI) and their hearing parents. Parents of deaf children encounter a unique challenge to family unity. Since most of these parents are themselves hearing, they experience a feeling of being different from their child (Adams, 1997). As a result, most of these parents {{do not know how to}} communicate with them. With the advancement of cochlear implant technology, and earlier identification of deafness in children, the potential for intervention has changed a lot. However, it is important to understand that simply providing CI does not mean that a child will start to understand spoken language. There is an important distinction between the ability to hear sounds, and the understanding of <b>speech.</b> In <b>bridging</b> this distinction, parents have to help their child a lot, because they are the main people who can help them in language development. Parents need to learn how to develop their child s communication skills through meaningful everyday interactions with them. Qualitative research was chosen as an approach in this study. Using a qualitative research and case study design, this thesis describes the communication process between hearing parents and their cochlear implanted children. The study sheds light on how parents help their children to develop communication skills. Data was collected by means of observation, note taking, and interview. The data is mostly based on observations of the parent –child interaction. This thesis is organized into 5 chapters. I discussed in Chapter 1 the difficulties that parents face when learning that their child has a hearing disorder. They must make early decisions for treatment, and need to find the time to learn methods to communicate with their child. They must also manage their expectations, and learn the important distinction between hearing sound and understanding language. In the second chapter, I presented a literature review that covered useful and relevant research to my research problem. I described different types of hearing loss, and potential treatments. The three children I studied as a part of this thesis were all prelingually deaf, which means that they lost their hearing before they had learned to speak or understand a language. In chapter II, I also drew on theories from researchers such as Vygotsky, who suggests that early development and learning best takes place within the context of the child s cultural group, usually the family. Vygotsky places an emphasis on the child s interaction with others, and parent s role in facilitating language and communication development in the child. This theory forms the basis for the hypothesis that a child s success with cochlear implants heavily depends on their parent s efforts in helping them. Bruner similarly agrees with Vygotsky that a child learns language in interaction with adults, and parents should play an active role in assisting a child s learning. They both emphasise the social nature of learning, citing that parents should help children develop their language abilities through the process of scaffolding. I explain in Chapter 3 my research methods, explaining that the qualitative research method is most suited to this type of study. A qualitative research method enabled observation and interviews, whereby I could ascertain from the parents the methods they use to communicate with their cochlear implanted children, as well as their child s medical history and the parent s feelings and opinions on certain methods, and their reasons for choosing them. My sample was small due to the relatively rare nature of CI, and the difficulties in contacting potential recipients. I also had strict criterion that needed to be met. I followed every procedure in ensuring the recipient s confidentiality and informing them that they could withdraw at any time, and arranged interviews with the parents to gather relevant background information and to arrange a time and place for observations. This was extremely useful as these observations have formed the backbone of my thesis, and I managed to observe the parents in different situations and utilising different methods of communication and encouragement. Ethical considerations were also accommodated, and all the child s names were changed to protect confidentiality. In the fourth chapter, an actual analysis of my results was outlined, including several example conversations between the parents and their child, describing the communication strategies the family were using and its subsequent impacts. I provided a brief history and description of the three children, including their age of diagnosis and the age they had CI implanted. The conclusion is in chapter 5. My findings support the theories of Vygotsky and Bruner, as well as past research by Hart & Riley s, Spencer & Lederbergs and Warren & Walkers. Parents who listen to their child, follow their lead, actively engage and use positive feedback can have excellent communication with their children...|$|R
40|$|Organizer & Introduction: Diana Van Lancker Sidtis, New York University, Nathan Kline Institute, NY Presenters: Tania Kouteva, University of Düsseldorf, Germany Benjamin Stahl, Freie Üniversität Berlin, Germany Kelly Bridges, New York University, Nathan Kline Institute, NY, William Paterson University, NJ Seung-yun Yang, New York University, Nathan Kline Institute, NY Background Formulaic {{language}} (conversational speech formulas, idioms, recited speech) {{is important}} in communication, revealing a large repertory in various kinds of discourse. Damage in the left hemisphere (LH) {{is associated with a}} significant increase (30 %) in formulaic expressions in spontaneous speech in comparison to healthy persons (25 %), while right hemisphere (RH) damage yields a significant diminution (17 %). Basal ganglia damage leads to impoverished proportions (Speedie et al., 1993), while Alzheimer’s disease (AD) features increased formulaic expressions. These observations have led to the “dual processing” model of language, whereby formulaic and grammatical language are processed differently in the brain. Presenters 	Dr. Tania Kuteva (Heine et al., 2014) presents a parallel between Formulaic vs. Novel language in the dual process model of Van Lancker Sidtis (2004, 2012), and Thetical Grammar vs. Sentence Grammar, within the framework of Discourse Grammar, showing how speech from persons with aphasia and LH damage contrasts systematically with data from persons with RH damage. There is a preponderance of impaired Sentence Grammar in LH damage, and, by contrast, greater difficulties with Thetical Grammar in RH dysfunction (Heine et al. 2014). This linguistic perspective supports a distinct role for formulaic expressions in cerebral processing. Dr. Benjamin Stahl (et al., 2011, 2013) investigated the influence of melody, rhythm, and formulaic expressions on aphasic speech and language recovery after LH stroke. Results suggest that the efficacy of melody-based aphasia therapy may depend on rhythm and formulaic expressions. Rhythmic pacing and successful retention of formulaic expressions surpassed the effects of melodic intonation. Patients with non-fluent aphasia were able to use formulaic language resources in therapy, establishing an individual formulaic repertoire to communicate basic needs. This talk has implications for a role of formulaic expressions in language rehabilitation, a concept which has yet to be adopted in current, standard treatment approaches. Dr. Kelly Bridges will present findings on spontaneous speech in AD and on recited <b>speech</b> in PD (<b>Bridges</b> et al., 2013 a, b). Quantification of formulaic expressions in monologues in AD revealed a significantly higher incidence, while a study of recited speech in Parkinson’s disease showed a deficiency. Given that AD maintains functional subcortical systems while PD involves dysfunctional basal ganglia, these findings lend support to the notion that production of formulaic language relies on subcortical motor systems. Dr. Seung-yun Yang (2014) obtained speech samples that can be produced with either an idiomatic or a literal meaning (e. g., “It broke the ice”) from native speakers of Korean with focal left (LH) or right hemisphere (RH) lesions. Measures were listening studies, acoustic analysis of F 0 and duration, and subjective ratings of voice. Healthy listeners failed in discerning this contrast in speech produced in RH damage. Acoustic analyses revealed that F 0 measures deviated from normal in the RH group and durational measures were abnormal in the LH group. Summary Formulaic language studies remain less well recognized in language disorders. Profiles of differential formulaic language abilities in neurological disease have implications for cerebral models of language and for clinical evaluation and treatment of neurogenic language disorders...|$|R
