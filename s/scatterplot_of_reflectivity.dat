40|$|Cross-study {{validation}} of gene expression investigations {{is critical in}} genomic analysis. We developed an R package and associated object definitions to merge and visualize multiple gene expression datasets.

Visualization tools support exploration and cross-study {{validation of}} the data, without requiring normalization across platforms. Tools include "integrative correlation" plots that is, <b>scatterplots</b> <b>of</b> all pairwise correlations in one study against the corresponding pairwise correlations of another, both for individual genes and all genes combined. Gene-specific plots {{can be used to}} identify genes whose changes are reliably measured across studies. Visualizations also include <b>scatterplots</b> <b>of</b> gene-specific statistics quantifying relationships between expression and phenotypes of interest, using linear, logistic and Cox regression.

40|$|The underpotential {{deposition}} of monolayer of lead on platinum and its catalytic effects on oxidation of formic acid were studied by specular reflectance technique. A monolayer of lead causes a large change <b>of</b> <b>reflectivity</b> <b>of</b> platinum electrode. The wavelength dependence of relative change <b>of</b> <b>reflectivity</b> has been determined. The intermediates in oxidation of formic acid, however, cause a small change <b>of</b> <b>reflectivity</b> <b>of</b> platinum electrode.

This explains a smaller catalytic of its adatoms...|$|R
