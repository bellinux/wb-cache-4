40|$|We study bifurcations arising in {{a system}} of two synaptically {{interconnected}} neurons where the individual neurons are represented by the Morris-Lecar model. The <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnection</b> strength and externally applied input dc current are treated as bifurcation parameters and the critical values that result in neural excitability are identified. It is seen that the synaptic coupling strength, (i) strongly reduces the threshold of external current that determines excitability in isolated neurons and (ii) preserves the type I mechanism of neural excitability. As an interesting consequence, individual neurons which are at rest for a given set of parameters can be rendered excitable under <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnection.</b> Numerical simulations are presented to verify the analytical results. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} for a long time that, on a {{large-scale}} macroscopic scale, cortical activation states can be modeled by considering the dynamics of two non-linearly coupled populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons [11], spatially organized into stereotyped modules. Considering the huge number of cells found in layered cortical areas neuronal activation is usually defined over spatially continuous domains (neural fields) as continuous distribution of neurons and synapses where each point in space corresponds to a neural population [6]. Formally, each layer dynamics is described by integro-differential ordinary equations, where the integral kernel is a smooth function that replaces the <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnection</b> matrix and continuous position variables replace the indices of discrete models. In this way, metric relations apply and it becomes possible to model the geometrical properties, such as spatial nearness and topology, that characterize the rich anatomy structure of cortical areas (e. g., maps, columns, dendritic and axonal arborizations, cell density, etc.) [7] [4]. By introducing a diffusive coupling into the equations that govern the punctual excitation-inhibition reactions, additional local interactions take place, providing a gradual spread of the variations of activity in space and simulates the continuity constraint of the neural field. In general, reaction-diffusion systems are natural candidates to model cortical phenomenologica...|$|E

The members of the Kavli Neuroscience Prize Committee have decided to reward three scientists (Sten Grillner, Thomas Jessell, and Pasko Rakic) jointly “for discoveries on the developmental and functional logic of neuronal circuits”. Pasko Rakic performed groundbreaking studies of the developing cerebral cortex, including the discovery of how radial glia guide the neuronal migration that establishes cortical layers and for the radial unit hypothesis {{and its implications for}} cortical connectivity and evolution. Thomas Jessell discovered molecular principles governing the specification and patterning of different neuron types and the development of their <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnection</b> into sensorimotor circuits. Sten Grillner elucidated principles of network organization in the vertebrate locomotor central pattern generator, along with its command systems and sensory and higher order control. The discoveries of Rakic, Jessell and Grillner provide a framework for how neurons obtain their identities and ultimate locations, establish appropriate connections with each other, and how the resultant neuronal networks operate. Their work has significantly advanced our understanding of brain development and function and created new opportunities for the treatment of neurological disorders.

Most importantly, without any intentional hard-wired connection, such synaptic arrays are intercoupled due to the electric-field induced lateral proton modulation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the tiger}} {{salamander}} retina, visual signals are {{transmitted to the}} inner retina via six morphologically distinct types of photoreceptors: large/small rods, large/small single cones, and double cones composed of principal and accessory members. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the morphology of these photoreceptors and their <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnection</b> with bipolar cells and horizontal cells in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Here we showed that glutamate antibodies labeled all photoreceptors and recoverin antibodies strongly labeled all cones and weakly labeled all rods. Antibodies against calbindin selectively stained accessory members of double cones. Antibodies against S-cone opsin stained small rods, a subpopulation of small single cones, and the outer segments of accessory double cones and a subtype of unidentified single cones. On average, large rods and small S-cone opsin positive rods accounted for 98. 6 % and 1. 4 % of all rods, respectively. Large/small cones, principle/accessory double cones, S-cone opsin positive small single cones, and S-cone opsin positive unidentified single cones accounted for about 66. 9 %, 23 %, 4. 5 %, and 5. 6 % of the total cones, respectively. Moreover, the differential connection between rods/cones and bipolar/horizontal cells and the wide distribution of AMPA receptor subunits GluR 2 / 3 and GluR 4 at the rod/cone synapses were observed. These results provide anatomical evidence for the physiological findings that bipolar/horizontal cells in the salamander retina are driven by rod/cone inputs of different weights, and that AMPA receptors play an important role in glutamatergic neurotransmission at the first visual synapses. The different photoreceptors selectively contacting bipolar and horizontal cells support the idea that visual signals may be conveyed to the inner retina by different functional pathways in the outer retina...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Extensive {{synaptic}} connectivity is {{a hallmark}} of neuronal circuitry. In the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal neurons receive around 10, 000 synapses. Network models allow us to explore the computational potential of such connectivity. Any of the neuron models discussed in chapter 6 {{can be used to}} build network models, but detailed mathematical analysis and efficient simulation of large networks are often restricted to cases where the individual neurons and synapses are modeled relatively simply. Most work on networks uses either the integrate-and-fire neurons or the rate-model neurons discussed in chapter 6. In this chapter, we use rate-model neurons. Cortical circuits have three broad classes of <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections.</b> Feedforward connections bring input to a given region from a previous area along a particular processing pathway.

40|$|Recent {{intracellular}} recordings from reticular thalamic (RE) neurons at resting and hyperpolarized membrane potentials in vivo {{suggest that}} the reversed inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) between RE cells can directly trigger a low-threshold spike. The oscillatory mechanisms underlying IPSP-triggered low-threshold spikes crowned by spike-bursts within the RE nucleus and their effect on the network behavior were investigated in models of an isolated RE network and network of RE and thalamocortical (TC) cells. In a one-dimensional RE network the external stimulation resulted in waves of excitation propagating with constant velocity 25 - 150 cells/sec controlled by the GABAA conductance, radius of <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections</b> in the network {{and the level of}} membrane potential in RE cells. In a one-dimensional network of RE and TC cells sequences of spindle oscillations were followed by localized waves propagating inside the RE network, triggering oscillations involving both RE and TC cells.

40|$|Abstract. Smart grid is an {{electric}} power network which enables an ef-fective use of electric {{power in a}} highly parallel distributed manner. We have first formulated the basic equations for the smart grid by inspiring from the mechanisms in biological organism, and controled the power-flow dynamically in the smart grid by monitoring an objective function, which reflects the power-flow and the constraint imposing on the power nodes. To validate {{the operation of the}} smart grid, we performed several simulation experiments: which include the operations of a conventional power network, a microgrid (comprises eight power nodes), and a smart grid (comprises three microgrids integrated into the conventional power network) both in synchronous and asynchronous manners for the opera-tion of power nodes. Furthermore, even for the case of power failure such as outage, power recovery can be automatically achieved through bypass connections similar to <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections</b> in a dynamic function of brain. This kind of flexible function in the smart grid makes it possible to promote the introduction of renewable energy, such as solar energy, wind energy, and biomass energy rather than fossil energy...|$|R
40|$|Early {{cognitive}} vision {{is one of}} the most important perceptive functions in the mammalian cerebral cortex. During information processing in the visual cortex, many bioelectrical signals are exchanged between cortical neurons, across their <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections.</b> When modelling visual cortex processing a dynamic scene can be modelled as an optical flow field, which can, in turn, be mapped on to a neuronal network. A possible, simple network structure has neurons placed along axes arranged radially from the optical flow field centre with only nearest-neighbour, on-axis connections. The characteristics of a dynamic scene can thus be reconstructed by local computation in neurons based upon the optical flow field. We have modelled a large-scale leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuronal network in precisely this network arrangement. The model uses edge-sensitive pixels to capture the position and speed of movement of features in a moving scene. Subsequently, object identification is achieved and depth information is recovered. In this example, we have restricted movement to a straight line, with a constant relative speed between a moving cognitive model and the static scene. Each neuron has two excitatory input synapses. One connects to the edge-sensitive pixel and is referred to as the receptive synapse. The second receives a prediction of the time-of-arrival of an edge from the previous neuron in the flow field, and is referred to as the flow synapse. When an edge passes a pixel sensor, the corresponding LIF neuron will issue a spike provided that the sum of excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP...|$|R
40|$|Band heterotopias are {{an example}} of genetic {{generalized}} neuronal migration disorders that may be present in patients with mild epilepsy and normal or slightly impaired intellect, {{as well as in}} patients with intractable epilepsy and mental retardation. The case of a 17 -year-old left-handed female patient with epilepsy and normal cognitive development is reported in whom single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed. MRI revealed the presence of bilateral asymmetric band heterotopia, SPECT revealed a left frontoparietal and occipital hypoperfusion, demonstrating a good correlation with the electroencephalogram abnormalities. Because of the appearance of new types of seizures, the patient underwent a second MRI investigation together with a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study, MRI confirmed bilateral band heterotopia characterized by greater thickness in the left hemisphere at the frontal and occipital level. MRI and SPECT findings were in agreement wi th left occipital electroencephalogram abnormalities and with occipital seizure type. Qualitative results of proton MRS revealed normal spectra profiles in the examined left frontal and occipital heterotopic area and in the normal overlying cortex. Later, fMRI was performed. The finger-tapping test of the right hand yielded the activation of both normal left sensory-motor cortex and the facing band heterotopia, In the right hemisphere, only the activation of the sensory-motor neocortex was observed; no involvement of the right misplaced brain tissue was present. This functional behavior could be considered the consequence of poor neuronal representation. On the contrary, the involvement of both band heterotopia and normal cortex observed in the left hemisphere could be the result of many <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections.</b> Functional investigations may have an important role in defining the activity of band heterotopia per se and in relation to the overlying neocortex.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the neurocomputation by {{implementing}} two different neuron models. One is a semi magnetic micro p-n wire that emulates nerve fibres and supports the electrical propagation and regeneration. The {{other is a}} silicon neuron based on Hodgkin-Huxley conductance model that can generate spatiotemporal spiking patterns. The former model focuses on the spatial propagation of electrical pulses along a transmission line and presents the thesis that action potentials may be represented by solitary waves. The later model focuses on the dynamical properties such as how the output patterns of the active networks adapt to external stimulus. To demonstrate the dynamical properties of spiking networks, we present a central pattern generator (CPG) network with winnerless competition architecture. The CPG consists of three silicon neurons which are connected via reciprocally inhibitory synapses. The network of three neurons was stimulated with current steps possessing different time delays and that the voltage oscillations of the three neurons were recorded {{as a function of}} the strengths of inhibitory <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections</b> and internal parameters of neurons, such as voltage thresholds, time delays, etc. The architecture of the network is robust and sensitively depends on the stimulus. Stimulus dependent rhythms can be generated by the CPG network. The stimulus-dependent sequential switching between collective modes of oscillations in the network can explain the fundamental contradiction between sensitivity and robustness to external stimulus and the mechanism of pattern memorization. We successfully apply the CPG in modulating the heart rate of animal models (rats). The CPG was stimulated with respiratory signals and generated tri-phasic patterns corresponding to the respiratory cycles. The tri-phasic stimulus from the CPG was used to synchronize the heart rate with respiration. In this way, we artificially induce the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which refers to the heart rate fluctuation in synchrony with respiration. RSA is lost in heart failure. Our CPG paves to way to novel medical devices that can provide a therapy for heart failure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{feasibility}} of the use of tissue cultures for studying some of the mechanisms of synaptic transmission in the mammalian CNS. The cerebellar cultures are particularly suitable because their morphological features have been studied in detail, offering a possibility of correlating electrophysiological and morphological data. Another advantage of the cerebellum is that its structure and function are relatively well known in vivo so the validity of the tissue culture model can be well tested in this case. It is well known from previous studies that functional synapses develop in the cerebellar cultures. However, the patterns of synaptic connections in cultures, in particular the interactions between cortex (Cx), deep cerebellar nuclei (DN) and brain stem (BS) have not been investigated. Electrophysiological experiments were performed on fully developed cultures 3 - 4 weeks old. The cultures were placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope so the electrodes could be placed near the neurones under visual control. The temperature of the perfusing solution (Earle's balanced salt solution) was maintained at 35 - 37 °C and the pH at 7. 3 - 7. 4. One region of the cultures was usually activated by brief electrical pulses and synaptically evoked responses were sought in a different region. Stimulation of the DN area resulted in a synaptic activation of about 50 % of the Cx neurones whereas a stimulation of the Cx area evoked 30 % of the DN neurones antidromically. On the basis of known conduction velocities and latencies of the synaptically evoked responses it has been concluded that in culture DN neurones form a synaptic projection to the Cx area, which resembles a mossy fiber pathway found in the intact cerebellum (Tolbert et al., 1976). Electron microscopic observations in culture give supporting evidence for the mossy type projection from the DN to the Cx (Hendelman et al., 1978). Another synaptic pathway which has been well documented in culture is the monosynaptic inhibitory projection from the Cx region to the DN. Satisfactory electrophysiological and morphological evidence has been obtained to suggest that the projection is monosynaptic and that it can be routinely reproduced in culture. Electrophysiological characteristics of the pathway resemble those described in vivo by Ito et al. (1970 a). Using pharmacological blockers, such as Bicuculline, Picrotoxin and Strychnine, it has been shown that GABA is probably the neurotransmitter responsible for the inhibition. This observation is similar to that of Obata et al. (1970 a) who studied an analogous synaptic connection in the lateral vestibular nucleus of cats. In addition to the two major pathways demonstrated in cultures, evidence for recurrent axon collaterals of DN neurones and possibly Purkinje neurones has been obtained which again is in agreement with previous morphological observations in culture as well as in vivo. The presence of inhibitory interneurones in the Cx area was also evident. Neurones from the BS area, which can be included with the cerebellar cultures, have also been studied in spite of their uncertain identity. No firm evidence could be obtained as to the terminations of these neurones in other areas of the cultures but the results suggest that these neurones are excitatory and that they are interconnected by excitatory synapses which are possibly formed by the terminals of their own recurrent axon collaterals. A sparse inhibitory projection from the Cx to the BS area has been shown. Such a detailed demonstration of the <b>synaptic</b> <b>interconnections</b> in tissue cultures which resemble those in vivo provides a background for further experimentation. The tissue culture model of the Cb can be used for investigation of the mechanisms of synaptic transmission and the action of various pharmacological agents on the neurones. The advantage of such a model system lies primarily in its accessibility to pharmacological manipulations which are often difficult in the intact brain...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of the neural networks is their high number of interconnections between the neurons through <b>synaptic</b> multipliers. <b>Interconnections</b> occupy large area and increase the circuit complexity which limits {{the size of the}} fully parallel network. To implement large size networks, time-multiplexing should be used. Two new mixed-signal time-multiplexed architectures are proposed for on-chip mixed-signal neural networks. MRIII is used for training the network which is more robust to mixed-signal designs. The problem of node addressing and routing is solved by performing the operations in current mode. The architectures are simple and compact and learning is performed on-chip without the host computer, which reduces the cost of learning for the network. Mixed-signal MDACs are used for synaptic multiplication. A new compact architecture is proposed for the MDAC to reduce the area, power consumption and noise. The proposed MDAC performs the digital to analog conversion in series. Comparison shows that the new MDAC is more linear and has less noise than the conventional MDAC. The layout of the proposed MDAC is relatively easy, since it has a repetitive structure. For the first time, a new 12 -bit MDAC is implemented, which enables us to perform on-chip training. The proposed 12 -bit MDAC still occupies less area compared to the 7 -bit conventional MDAC. A new low-voltage class-AB high-drive buffer for driving the voltages off-chip is developed. The proposed buffer is able to drive capacitive loads up to 2 nF. It also drives resistive loads down to 2 kO from rail to rail. For compensation, a 0. 2 pF capacitor is used.
