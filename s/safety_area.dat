5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway <b>safety</b> <b>area</b> and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the <b>safety</b> <b>area</b> resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E

This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway <b>safety</b> <b>area</b> and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a topological risk mapping for aircraft overruns. The proposed procedure {{is based on}} the study published in 2008 by Hall et al. (Analysis of aircraft overruns and undershoots for runway <b>safety</b> <b>areas.</b> Airport Cooperative Research Program. Washington, DC: Transportation Research Board; 2008). In that study the authors performed an analysis of aircraft overruns and undershoots for runway <b>safety</b> <b>areas</b> proposing the ACRP hazard probability model. In the present study the model was integrated into a two-step Monte Carlo simulation procedure to assess the risk of overrun accidents and to provide a topological risk map for a specific airport area. The model was modified to utilize traffic-related and weather-related factors described by statistical distributions of historical data of the airport under analysis. The probability distribution of overrun events was then combined with the Longitudinal and Lateral Location models Hall et al. (Analysis of aircraft overruns and undershoots for runway <b>safety</b> <b>areas.</b> Airport Cooperative Research Program. Washington, DC: Transportation Research Board; 2008) to obtain a two-dimensional grid assessing the probability of each area to be the end point of a runway overrun. The expected kinetic energy of the aircraft in a given point of the grid is used as severity index. The procedure is suitable for generalisation and it allows a more detailed planning of Airport <b>Safety</b> <b>Areas</b> (ASA), improving the correct implementation of ICAO recommendations. Results are also useful for land planning and structural analyses in airport areas. - Highlights: • Two-step probabilistic procedure for the topological characterisation of overrun risk in airports. • Monte Carlo simulation applied to existing overrun probability and location models. • Proposed topological severity index: Iso-Kinetic Energy Areas (KEA). • Expected kinetic energy almost constant for about 1000 m beyond the runway end...|$|R
