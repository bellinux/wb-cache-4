50|$|A {{soldering}} iron stand keeps the iron away from flammable materials, and often {{also comes with}} a cellulose sponge and flux pot for cleaning the tip. Some {{soldering iron}}s for continuous and professional use come {{as part of a}} <b>soldering</b> <b>station,</b> which allows the exact temperature of the tip to be adjusted, kept constant, and sometimes displayed.|$|E
5000|$|This {{division}} is also noticeable {{in the maintenance}} and repair {{of these kinds of}} products. Brown goods usually require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a soldering iron to a hot-air <b>soldering</b> <b>station),</b> while white goods may need more practical skills and [...] "brute force" [...] to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.|$|E
50|$|For {{soldering}} and desoldering small surface-mount components {{with two}} terminals, such as some links, resistors, capacitors, and diodes, soldering tweezers can be used; {{they can be}} either free-standing or controlled from a <b>soldering</b> <b>station.</b> The tweezers have two heated tips mounted on arms whose separation can be manually varied by squeezing gently against spring force, like simple tweezers; the tips are applied to the two ends of the component. The main purpose of the soldering tweezers is to melt solder in the correct place; components are usually moved by simple tweezers or vacuum pickup.|$|E
50|$|The Electronic Shop has {{laboratory}} test and measuring instruments, <b>soldering</b> <b>stations,</b> and component testers, to trouble shoot faculty instruments {{and set them}} right. Electronic components are maintained in the store for quick replacement.|$|R
50|$|First {{used in the}} 1970s by Japanese radio manufacturers, for {{microphone}} connectors on Citizens Band {{and amateur}} radio equipment, these screw-on circular connectors were available with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 pins. They often were used for other purposes as well, such as 1970s Kenwood mobile transceivers, Eastern Asian built <b>soldering</b> <b>stations</b> in 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The {{space has}} 3 {{distinct}} meeting rooms. Workshop equipment includes <b>soldering</b> <b>stations,</b> electronic measurement and diagnostic tools, a laser engraver, 3D printers, a CNC mill, and a metal lathe. A multi-purpose meeting room featuring a 60-inch high definition display, seats about 20 people at tables, and about 35 without tables. A smaller workspace in the building's basement contains heavier {{tools such as}} an optical table and an in-progress CNC router/3D-printer, and storage shelves. The church's common spaces are available for larger events.|$|R
50|$|For {{electrical}} and electronics work, a low-power iron, a power rating between 15 and 35 watts, is used. Higher ratings are available, {{but do not}} run at higher temperature; instead there is more heat available for making soldered connections to things with large thermal capacity, for example, a metal chassis. Some irons are temperature-controlled, running at a fixed temperature {{in the same way}} as a <b>soldering</b> <b>station,</b> with higher power available for joints with large heat capacity. Simple irons run at an uncontrolled temperature determined by thermal equilibrium; when heating something large their temperature drops a little, possibly too much to melt solder.|$|E
50|$|A <b>soldering</b> <b>station,</b> {{invariably}} temperature-controlled, {{consists of}} an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a soldering iron or soldering head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and a soldering head; a desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and a soldering iron head.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{soldering}} irons reach {{a temperature}} determined by thermal equilibrium, dependent upon power input and cooling by {{the environment and}} the materials it comes into contact with. The iron temperature will drop when in contact with a large mass of metal such as a chassis; a small iron will lose too much temperature to solder a large connection. More advanced irons for use in electronics have a mechanism with a temperature sensor and method of temperature control to keep the tip temperature steady; more power is available if a connection is large. Temperature-controlled irons may be free-standing, or may comprise a head with heating element and tip, controlled by a base called a <b>soldering</b> <b>station,</b> with control circuitry and temperature adjustment and sometimes display.|$|E
40|$|Are your <b>{{soldering}}</b> <b>stations</b> burning money? Most hand soldering systems invite higher temperature {{settings to}} solder lead-free joints. But poor control slows temperature response and promotes overshoot, leading to increased tip replacement rates, scrap boards, and energy consumption. You are almost literally burning money. The MFR Series Multi-Function Rework Systems from OK International combine convenience and reliability with {{the advantages of}} Metcal Smartheat ® technology, to solder lead-free joints efficiently and economically at lower source temperatures. The MFR Series is easy to use, {{with a wide range}} of variants and upgrades available to meet your needs long into the future. For more information visit: www. okinternational. co...|$|R
40|$|The colony Colonia Claudia ara Agrippinensium, {{located in}} modern day Köln, {{was a major}} center for control of Grermania Minor during the Roman Empire and a very strong {{military}} base. It was founded in 30 BCE by the Ubii, a Gaulic tribe, for their loyalty to the Romans during the Gaulic Wars of Caesar. I am planning on examining {{the interaction of the}} culture between the <b>solders</b> who got <b>stationed</b> there and the locals who originally founded the town. I believe that the interaction was a positive one with little tension and I plan to express this by showing and explaining the mixing of cultures that happened between them. I am examining this though the lens of archeological remains from the city and primary sources text on the region. I want to try to use the techniques Foucault used in The Order of Things to interpret the evidence that is left in the region...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a complete {{description of the}} design and implementation of a 500 W transformer <b>soldering</b> <b>station.</b> This <b>soldering</b> <b>station</b> includes a half-bridge DC/DC converter with a pulse transformer. The device works with a very low voltage and extremely high output current. Therefore some parts have a special design to ensure the proper equipment function. Coaxial transformer with very low leakage inductance (nH units) is unusual. A synchronous rectifier is another special feature working with low voltage and high output current of the transformer. The finished functional prototype consists of a <b>soldering</b> <b>station</b> and a soldering adapter...|$|E
30|$|The {{electronic}} circuit was designed using the Altium Designer program. The prepared prototype {{was transferred to}} an FR 4 plate, and fixation was completed at the <b>soldering</b> <b>station</b> (ERSA, Istanbul, Turkey). The prepared circuit {{was placed in a}} plastic housing box, HH 055. In the USB Chip Scheduler hardware, a control card with a USB 2.0 type B Jack output was used. Computer connection was achieved using a USB type B cable.|$|E
40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is to develop and then build system that would keep {{constant}} temperature in a given place or that of a given material (item), {{in this case it}} would be control system for a hot air <b>soldering</b> <b>station</b> heater with output up to 600 W, with required adjustable temperature range of 150 - 500 °C. Second goal {{of this work}} is to develop and then build this device using possibly simplest wiring and as small amount of components as possible...|$|E
