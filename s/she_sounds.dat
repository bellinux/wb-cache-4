500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{recorded}} for the album, [...] "Gang Bang" [...] {{was confirmed by}} Madonna {{to be part of}} the track listing, which was revealed on her official website on February 2012. On March 8, the singer and co-writer of the track, Mika, tweeted that it was [...] "weird as fuck, underground and lyrically cool; it's amazing and bizarre. I love it, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> so good singing words so harsh." [...] The same day, a snippet of the track was released. Orbit also commented about the song's dark tone and lyrics: ...|$|E
500|$|Swift desired for Caillat to sing {{background}} vocals {{but in a}} loud manner, {{enough for}} audiences to recognize who sang backup. Originally Swift and Caillat were only to harmonize in the chorus, but as Caillat recorded, Swift decided to include her voice more throughout the track because of how impressed she was. Swift first recorded the entire song, and Caillat then recorded background vocals separately. Swift was {{very pleased with the}} finished product: [...] "I think <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> beautiful on it. I'm so excited to have her voice on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|Closer to the Truth, Cher's 25th studio {{album and}} the first since 2001's Living Proof, entered the Billboard 200 at number three in October 2013, her highest {{position}} on that chart to date. Michael Andor Brodeur from The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Cher's 'Goddess of Pop' sash remains in little danger of undue snatching; at 67, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> more convincing than J-Lo or Madonna reporting from 'the club'". Cher premiered the lead single [...] "Woman's World" [...] on the season four finale of the talent show The Voice, her first live TV performance in over a decade. She later joined the show's season five as judge Blake Shelton's team adviser.|$|E

But he chuckled, [...] "Now {{you just}} cuddle under Sam's wing, {{and if anybody}} rubbers at you too long, I'll shoo 'em off. Here we go! Watch my smoke--Sam'l, the ladies' delight and the bridegrooms' terror!" ...|$|R

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{selected}} [...] "Candyman" [...] {{as one of}} the two outstanding {{songs on}} the second disc of Back to Basics, alongside [...] "Mercy on Me". Lucy Davis for BBC Music was negative towards the song, writing that it [...] "successfully turns the volume and intensity down from 11 to somewhere like 5." [...] Jenny Eliscu from Rolling Stone criticized [...] "Candyman" [...] as [...] "a dead rip-off" [...] of the Andrews Sisters' [...] "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy." [...] A reviewer from The Guardian disapproved of the [...] "awful creation" [...] and wrote that [...] "the jollier <b>she</b> <b>sounds,</b> the more terrifying it becomes." [...] "Candyman" [...] received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2008 Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|The album {{entered the}} Billboard Classical Albums chart at No. 1, the Holiday Albums chart at No. 3, and peaked on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. It peaked at No. 9 on the Canadian Albums chart. Allmusic's review gives the album three stars, commenting, [...] "Evancho's vocals are {{impressive}} as always, and the arrangements are mostly tasteful, with only occasional moments of bombast". The Salt Lake City Tribune rated the album [...] "A-", writing: [...] "some {{of us are}} still taken aback when we hear such a strong, womanly voice float out of an 11 year-old child. ... Her best offering is the cherubic 'Believe'." [...] Christopher John Farley of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "when she sings, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> like she’s channeling a past life, a future self, or possibly an actual angel." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Starship Poopers", {{there is}} a shot of sound waves emanating from Springfield. At one point, {{there is a}} shot of North America {{and it appears that}} Springfield is located in Louisiana. The mystery of the {{location}} of Springfield is a running joke in The Simpsons, and a number of fans assumed that Louisiana was where the family lived. However, the animators had drawn the waves so that there were coming {{from the center of the}} screen, and they never intended to have them emanate from a specific location. In one scene, Marge is abducted by Kang and Kodos, who lasso her then pull her into the ship. According to David Cohen, it is a running gag that Kang and Kodos' abduction methods are never the same. Maggie has a line at the end of the episode, where <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> like Kang. She was voiced by Harry Shearer.|$|E

500|$|... "Let There Be Love" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic complimented Aguilera's {{approach to the}} song, writing that <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "fresh," [...] while Andrew Hampp for Billboard wrote {{that it is a}} club friendly song but does not show much personality. Chris Younie for 4Music thought that it is obvious from the [...] "initial stabs of synth" [...] that [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] will resonate [...] "Ibiza type" [...] beats. He continued to write that Aguilera had managed to create a [...] "dance anthem" [...] without the assistance of Calvin Harris. The Huffington Post writer Mesfin Fekadu thought that Martin's production of [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was superior to [...] "Your Body", citing it as [...] "typical" [...] but potentially successful on radio. Jim Farber for New York Daily News praised the song, writing that it is [...] "a prime disco diva anthem".|$|E
500|$|Nekesa Mumbi Moody of USA Today {{called it}} [...] "a sexy techno groove that you can't help but bounce to." [...] Theon Weber of The Village Voice said that [...] "Spears's writers present {{her with the}} goofiest, most vivacious {{productions}} she's ever had, filling 'Radar' with pinging noises and polishing Madonna's dance-floor trash bright." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy called it [...] "a rave-tinged electro blipathon on which Spears is vocodered {{to the point of}} sounding extra-terrestrial." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song [...] "seems to be bending over backwards to annoy the listener. Perhaps it's a last desperate tactic to win back some privacy: she's trying to get people to leave her alone by making as irritating a noise as possible." [...] A reviewer from the Ottawa Citizen said that [...] "some tracks [...] just don't work, such as Radar, in which Britney's voice is tuned up so high <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> like she's 14." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we think this is going to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with me, because it was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier, {{the album}} shows that [...] "There's an {{important}} difference between {{having a great}} voice and being a great singer. Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles (and octaves) around the most famous woman on the planet, but Madonna, through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match." [...] John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna [...] "can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers" [...] and found [...] "an unaffected simplicity and sincerity" [...] in her ballad singing. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine believed that with the album [...] "Madonna not only reminds us that there's more to her music than dance tunes, but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine." [...] He further explained, [...] "one {{of the most amazing}} things about the album is how sultry and assured <b>she</b> <b>sounds...</b> The Madonna on display here not only has a richer, deeper voice than you imagined, but more interpretive insight as well." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Letter to My Daughter, Younge states, [...] "At moments in the book <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> like an elderly relative, distraught at the wayward manners of the young," [...] but also says that Angelou seems to have [...] "outlived the need for social convention". Kirkus Reviews finds [...] "old {{fashioned}} wisdom" [...] in the book, and calls it [...] "a slim volume packed with nourishing nuggets of wisdom". Reviewer Karen Algeo Krizman says that [...] "Angelou delivers with her signature passion and fire" [...] and that although the essays are [...] "easy to take in during brief moments of quiet", they have a powerful message. Laura L. Hutchison of The Fredicksburg Free Lance-Star states that Letter is [...] "written in Angelou's beautiful, poetic style" [...] and called the essays [...] "advice from a beloved aunt or grandmother, whose wisdom you know was earned". Hutchinson also stated that the book would gain Angelou new readers, and that her current audience would read and reread it. Psychologists Eranda Jayawickreme and Marie J. C. Forgearda called the essays in Letter to My Daughter [...] "illuminating" [...] and {{used it as a}} non-scientific, interdisciplinary textto teach positive psychology.|$|E

5000|$|That night, Hogan and Jimmy Hart wrote several {{songs for}} the album. Hogan let {{his wife at}} the time Linda sing back up vocals {{on a couple of}} the songs because, {{according}} to him, <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> better than [...] "the rest of the stuff." ...|$|R

500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was exemplary in that [...] "Swift is a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track {{to that of}} producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who he referred to as [...] "Swedish pop gods". He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted {{it sounds like it}} has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed the role of a big sister instead of a big star, {{to be one of the}} best and the most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past. Leah Greenbelt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "When she sings about sexuality, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita".|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush was {{complimentary}} of Lewis's vocals, {{writing that}} <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> [...] "appealing and captivating," [...] {{and continued to}} say that it is what her fans have been waiting for. Sciarretto gave [...] "Collide" [...] a rating of three out of a possible five stars. Lewis Corner for Digital Spy praised the song, writing that Lewis combined her ability to deliver power ballad lyrics into a dance orientated song. Corner compared the song to Katy Perry's [...] "Firework", also produced by Sandy Vee; however, Corner noted that Lewis performs [...] "Collide" [...] in a way which distances the comparison. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust was critical of the song. Whilst she noted that Lewis was venturing into dance music, where artists such as David Guetta and Kylie Minogue have experienced great success, and that Lewis has an iconic voice compared to both, she felt that the delivery still lacked. St. Asaph wrote [...] "The lethargic, two-note verses make her voice sound less husky than bored, an emotion that a comeback single should never evoke." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian felt that the song seemed to build and drop at the wrong times, and that its structure was not cohesive. Cragg continued to say that Lewis does a [...] "passable job as a dance diva," [...] and noted the resemblances between [...] "Collide" [...] and [...] "Penguin".|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{said that}} “Loud works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, {{maintaining}} the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until {{it gets to}} 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> as remote as ever." [...] James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, [...] "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited {{about him in the}} first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting." ...|$|E
50|$|Further, {{she felt}} that there was a {{distance}} between the way <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> in a recorded and live performance, so when she started writing the album and was looking for a producer, she explained to her A&R that she needed to be produced as a band.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{that she}} had been {{influenced}} by the managerial Vida Sherwin; certainly <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> as though <b>she</b> was selling culture. But she dropped it when she sat on the couch, her chin in her hands, a volume of Yeats on her knees, and read aloud.|$|R
50|$|Brittany has synesthesia; <b>she</b> sees <b>sounds</b> as colors.|$|R
500|$|Priya Elan for NME was {{critical}} of Lewis's execution of the song [...] "Hurt", writing that <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> as though the singer took [...] "too much Night Nurse the evening before." [...] Elan noted that the composition of [...] "Hurt" [...] {{was similar to that}} of Lewis's cover of [...] "Run", writing [...] "there's an awful lot of layered build up to the chorus before a full band and orchestra come in during the second verse." [...] However, Elan concluded her review saying that although she appears not to know the legacy of the song, Lewis sounds [...] "pretty". Katherine St. Asaph for PopDust described Lewis's interpretation of [...] "Hurt" [...] as being formulaic like a [...] "template", writing that it is something that American Idol and The X Factor winners and contestants seem do when covering a song. St. Asaph continued to explain her opinions with regard to Lewis and [...] "Hurt", writing [...] "For Leona, that's big notes in bigger arrangements, with a couple hushed sections for contrast." [...] She was also skeptical of Lewis's emotive abilities, writing [...] "Either she knows that quiet-to-loud arrangements and whispered vocals can simulate gravitas pretty well regardless of whether you’re thinking of pain or grocery lists, or she’s genuinely feeling something that comes out in her voice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kyle Anderson for MTV considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] as [...] "a similar-sounding anthem [...] with some streamlined rock guitar taking center stage (there's even a solo). It's catchy enough." [...] Spence D. of IGN considered [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] " [...] Martin's glossy grown-up pop" [...] song, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] a [...] "further hit" [...] from ...Baby One More Time, along with [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "Sometimes". Music critic Walt Mueller wrote [...] "When Spears starts to sing on this one, <b>she</b> <b>sounds</b> {{a lot like}} Janet Jackson." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press noted that the song and [...] "Stronger" [...] are [...] "so lamely feel-good" [...] tracks that they [...] "could have been the theme song to a 'Karate Kid' sequel." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it a [...] "lightly dorky" [...] song, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as a [...] "fluffy dance-pop at its best." [...] In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was ranked ninth in a list of Spears' best songs. During the 2001 BMI Pop Awards, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song.|$|E
5000|$|Some critics defended Phair, however, {{arguing that}} the song {{is one of her}} most honest songs.
