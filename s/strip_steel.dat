50|$|The Ravenscraig steelworks, {{operated}} by Colvilles and from 1967 by British Steel Corporation, consisted {{of an integrated}} {{iron and steel works}} and a hot <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> mill. They were located in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>Steel</b> or {{cold rolled}} strip is a steel product that is {{produced}} from a hot rolled strip that has been pickled. The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold roll steel mill straight away or reversing mill or in a tandem mill consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product. High carbon <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> requires additional annealing and cold reduction operations. The coil is then slit to the desired width {{through the process of}} roll slitting.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 February 1951, as {{a result}} of the Iron and Steel Act 1949, the nationalised Scottish iron and steel {{companies}} came under the ownership of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. However, a change of Government and the passing of the Iron and Steel Act 1953, gradually returned the former nationalised Iron and Steel companies to their original owners. This was to be achieved via the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency, which was charged with creating an efficient industry. Stewarts & Lloyds was returned to its former owners in 1954; and Colvilles in 1955. Shortages of <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> led to the need to increase the capacity for producing <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> and tin plate, the first strip mill in Great Britain having been opened at Ebbw Vale in the late 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} {{analysis}} method was adopted to simulate the masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and was verified by comparing with test results. The influence rules of two factors including the cross sectional area of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression were investigated. The results show that, as for unreinforced masonry wall, {{the relationship of the}} shear capacity of unreinforced masonry wall and the vertical compressive strain is linear under lateral load; the speed of stiffness degeneration is accelerated after the peak point of the curves, but decrease with the increasing of lateral displacement. As for masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the shear capacity increases significantly, and shows nonlinear relationship with the cross section area of the <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression; ductility is improved.

5000|$|Another area of {{difference}} between EPS-treated <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> and acid-pickled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is rust resistance. Conventional acid-pickled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is frequently coated with a thin film of oil {{to serve as a}} barrier to contact with oxygen so as to prevent rusting. EPS-processed steel is inherently rust-inhibitive and, therefore, needs no oil or other coating to prevent rusting. Many [...] "downstream" [...] processes and steel fabrication processes must have the steel's oil coating (or other surface contaminants) removed as a precursor step of the process. Use of EPS-treated steel in these processes precludes the need for any such [...] "oil-stripping" [...] precursor step, thereby simplifying the process.|$|R

5000|$|Motherwell {{was noted}} as the steel {{production}} capital of Scotland, nicknamed Steelopolis. Its skyline {{was dominated by}} the gas holder and three cooling towers of the Ravenscraig steel plant which closed in 1992. The Ravenscraig plant {{had one of the}} longest continuous casting, hot rolling, steel production facilities in the world before it was decommissioned. Construction of the integrated iron and steel works started in 1954. The steel mill, which was built shortly after, was one of four in the United Kingdom.

5000|$|In Scotland, Western Europe's largest hot <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> mill Ravenscraig steelworks, near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, {{was closed}} by British Steel in 1992, leading to huge {{unemployment}} in the area. It also led to the closure of several local support and satellite businesses, such as the nearby British Steel Clydesdale Works in Mossend, Clyde Alloy in Netherton and equipment maker Anderson Strathclyde. Demolition of the site's landmark blue gasometer in 1996, and the subsequent cleanup operation, has created the largest brownfield site in Europe. This huge area between Motherwell and Wishaw is in line to be transformed into the new town of Ravenscraig, a project partly funded by Corus.|$|E
5000|$|Inland Steel {{continued}} to face heavy competition from U.S. Steel, the Pittsburgh-based giant {{that at that}} time possessed a dominant share of the U.S. steel market. World wars increased steel demand and pushed Inland Steel forward.

50|$|The badik {{consists}} of three parts, namely the handle and blade, {{as well as the}} sheath or scabbard. It comes in a great variety of shapes and sizes. The badik can have a straight, curved, bulbous or wavy, single- or double-edged blade. The blade is smooth or with hollow sections (fullered). The point of the blade can be either pointed or rounded. Like the kris, the shape of the blade is asymmetric and often shows patterns typical of pamor (pattern welding steel commonly known as Damascus steel). However, it differs from the kris in that the badik does not have a ganja (a buffer <b>strip</b> <b>steel).</b> Some versions from Sulawesi are decorated with inlaid gold figure on the blade called jeko. The handle is made of wood, horn or ivory in a shape of a pistol grip at a 45Â° to 90Â° angle or similar in a bent shape often decorated with carvings. From its native Sulawesi, the badik soon spread to neighbouring islands like Java, Borneo, Sumatra {{and as far as the}} Malay Peninsula, creating a wide variety of badik according to each region and ethnic group.

In the nickel platting process, the organic solvent, trichloroethylene, has previously been used for cleaning. Due to the carcinogenic nature of trichloroethylene and the many operations previously required during cleaning, it was considered to do cleaning of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> without use of the mentioned organic solvent. In the purpose of elimination of trichloroethylene from the cleaning process of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the tests of perforation of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> with use of oils of different viscosity were made.

The perforation percent was the same irrelevant of the viscosity of the used oil. Before being perforated using the oils with different viscosity, the nickel platting <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> were cleaned in different degreasers (based on NaOH as well as on KOH). It was shown that efficient cleaning without the use of trichloroethylene is possible with the use of oil with smaller viscosity in the perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> process and the degreaser based on KOH in the cleaning process, before nickel platting.

The signal of the width reduction rate exceeding a certain value means that the strip edge is too tight.

By applying this method, the incidence of strip breakage can be reduced and the productivity capacity can be increased, and more, the width control accuracy of the rolled steel strip can be improved.

40|$|AbstractReactive {{annealing}} of semi-processed electrical steels is {{an important}} process to reduce electro-magnetic losses. The annealing process involves heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> which is passed continuously through the furnace, to a certain temperature. The heated <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> gets decarburised and annealed in a warm gas atmosphere containing N 2 -H 2 -H 2 OCO-CO 2 mixture. The composition of the warm gas atmosphere {{plays a major role}} in both the decarburisation and selective oxidation of carbon from the <b>steel</b> <b>strip.</b> The furnace settings are often changed to cater for products with different metallurgical properties and varying dimensions. Often the line speed of the process too needs to be changed to cater to varying input parameters of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> such as composition, width, thickness etc. Thus an advanced mathematical model based system is desired to optimize the running of the furnace to achieve the desired properties at improved productivity. For effective control of system, mathematical model for the heating of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is developed. Decarburisation model for the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> has been coupled with the thermal model. The model takes in various inputs like line speed, composition of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> width and its thickness. Temperatures in the different zones of the furnace along with the decarburising gas flow rate, H 2 /H 2 O ratio etc, are taken as input parameters. The model predicts the thermal profile of the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> inside the furnace. It also predicts the carbon composition in the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> along the length of the furnace. Based on optimized temperature and carbon profile for different grades, the model suggests the desired line speed and the temperature settings in the different zones of the furnace. If there is a mismatch in the desired and the actual line speed the model also generates the desired set points of temperature for increasing or decreasing the furnace temperature which is downloaded to PLC in order to control the furnace parameters in real-time...|$|R
