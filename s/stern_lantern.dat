60|$|Rowing, {{he faced}} her, a hooded and cloaked shape, and {{above her head}} he had before his eyes the gleam of the <b>stern</b> <b>lantern</b> expiring slowly on the {{abandoned}} vessel. When it went out without a warning flicker he could see nothing of the stranded yacht's outline. She had vanished utterly like a dream; and the occurrences of the last twenty-four hours seemed also {{to be a part}} of a vanished dream. The hooded and cloaked figure was part of it, too. It spoke not; it moved not; it would vanish presently. Lingard tried to remember Mrs. Travers' features, even as she sat within two feet of him in the boat. He seemed to have taken from that vanished schooner not a woman but a memory--the tormenting recollection of a human being he would see no more.|$|E
60|$|Wasub's body swung {{over the}} sea with {{extended}} arms. Lingard caught up the sculls, and as the dinghy darted away from the brig's side he had a complete view of the lighted poop--Shaw leaning massively over the taffrail in sulky dejection, the flare bearers erect and rigid, the heads along the rail, the eyes staring after him above the bulwarks. The fore-end of the brig was wrapped in a lurid and sombre mistiness; the sullen mingling of darkness and of light; her masts pointing straight up could be tracked by torn gleams and vanished above as if the trucks had been tall enough to pierce the heavy mass of vapours motionless overhead. She was beautifully precious. His loving eyes saw her floating at rest in a wavering halo, between an invisible sky and an invisible sea, like a miraculous craft suspended in the air. He turned his head away as if the sight had been {{too much for him}} at the moment of separation, and, as soon as his little boat had passed beyond the limit of the light thrown upon the water, he perceived very low in the black void of the west the <b>stern</b> <b>lantern</b> of the yacht shining feebly like a star about to set, unattainable, infinitely remote--belonging to another universe.|$|E
50|$|The Gay Street {{entrance}} is approached by marble steps that are flanked by plinths with wrought-iron lamp standards with lamps resembling 18th century ship's <b>stern</b> <b>lanterns.</b> The entrance doors are protected behind wrought-iron grillework.|$|R
6000|$|Noyon stands about a {{mile from}} the river, in a little plain {{surrounded}} by wooded hills, and entirely covers an eminence with its tile roofs, surmounted by a long, straight-backed cathedral with two stiff towers. As we got into the town, the tile roofs seemed to tumble uphill one upon another, in the oddest disorder; but for all their scrambling, they did not attain above the knees of the cathedral, which stood, upright and solemn, over all. As the streets drew near to this presiding genius, through the market-place under the Hôtel de Ville, they grew emptier and more composed. Blank walls and shuttered windows were turned to the great edifice, and grass grew on the white causeway. [...] "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." [...] The Hôtel du Nord, nevertheless, lights its secular tapers within a stone-cast of the church; and we had the superb east-end before our eyes all morning from the window of our bedroom. I have seldom looked on the east-end of a church with more complete sympathy. As it flanges out in three wide terraces and settles down broadly on the earth, it looks like the poop of some great old battle-ship. Hollow-backed buttresses carry vases, which figure for the <b>stern</b> <b>lanterns.</b> There is a roll in the ground, and the towers just appear above the pitch of the roof, as though the good ship were bowing lazily over an Atlantic swell. At any moment it might be a hundred feet away from you, climbing the next billow. At any moment a window might open, and some old admiral thrust forth a cocked hat, and proceed to take an observation. The old admirals sail the sea no longer; the old ships of battle are all broken up, and live only in pictures; but this, that was a church before ever they were thought upon, is still a church, and makes as brave an appearance by the Oise. The cathedral and the river are probably the two oldest things for miles around; and certainly they have both a grand old age.|$|R
