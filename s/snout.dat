5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 <b>snout.</b> As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the <b>snout,</b> the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its <b>snout</b> at the surface of the water to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the <b>snout)</b> is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the <b>snout</b> connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the <b>snout</b> called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its <b>snout</b> was not blunt, and the teeth were {{not confined to the}} front of the <b>snout.</b> These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snouts</b> {{are found}} on many other mammals {{in a variety}} of shapes. Some animals, {{including}} ursines and great cats, have box-like <b>snouts,</b> while others, like shrews, have pointed <b>snouts.</b> Pig <b>snouts</b> are flat and cylindrical.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{crocodilians}} {{exhibit a}} similar morphological diversity, {{for example the}} broad <b>snouted</b> altirostral alligator and the long <b>snouted</b> dolichorostral gavial.|$|R
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long <b>snouts</b> (compared {{to the short}} <b>snouts</b> of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long <b>snouts</b> do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long <b>snouts</b> may facilitate better chewing.|$|R
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} <b>snout.</b> Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone {{on the top of}} its <b>snout,</b> and the single rounded horn on the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E
5|$|Pristiophoriformes: These are the sawsharks, with an elongated, toothed <b>snout</b> {{that they}} use for {{slashing}} their prey.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the <b>snout</b> worn smooth, indicating that the <b>snout</b> is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E

50|$|Scinax elaeochrous (common names: Sipurio <b>snouted</b> treefrog, olive <b>snouted</b> treefrog) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Hylidae. It {{is found in the}} Caribbean {{lowlands}} of Nicaragua and Panama and in the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica and Panama, with an isolated population in Colombia.|$|R
50|$|Schmidt's <b>snouted</b> frog is {{only known}} from the park.|$|R
5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its <b>snout.</b> A small bronze-coloured shark {{reaching}} a length of , it has a slender body and a long, pointed <b>snout.</b> Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips. The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo-Pacific, from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia. It inhabits warm, shallow waters close to shore.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} {{relative}} to the large body, and quite distinctive in shape, being flat and blunt at the front, like the <b>snout</b> of a pig. Some teeth are chisel-shaped, small and leaf-like, indicating a probable herbivorous diet, although peg-like teeth and a keratinous <b>snout</b> have been considered possible adaptations in some species for feeding on colonial insects. A study of the braincase of Stagonolepis robertsoni has shown that there are similarities between it and those of crocodylomorphs, which may indicate a close relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the <b>snout</b> taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} <b>snout</b> are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The jagged suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the <b>snout</b> are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

5|$|The <b>snout</b> of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded {{to the sides of}} the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, strap-like, side osteoderms of the <b>snout,</b> completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the <b>snout</b> had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the <b>snout</b> into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad <b>snout,</b> with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the <b>snout</b> being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Laticauda colubrina, {{commonly}} known as the banded sea krait, colubrine sea krait, or yellow-lipped sea krait, is a species of venomous sea snake found in tropical Indo-Pacific oceanic waters.

5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like <b>snout</b> and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its <b>snout</b> does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the <b>snout</b> of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The extant Alligatoridae are {{two species}} in the genus Alligator, and six species of caimans grouped into three genera. They can be {{recognised}} by the broad <b>snout,</b> in which the fourth tooth of the lower jaw cannot be seen when the mouth is closed.|$|E
50|$|Scinax x-signatus (common name: Venezuela <b>snouted</b> treefrog or Venezuelan <b>snouted</b> treefrog) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Hylidae. It is found in Brazil, the Guyanas (Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname), Venezuela and Colombia. Introduced populations exist on Guadeloupe and two nearby smaller islands, Marie Galante and La Désirade, and on Martinique. It may {{represent}} more than one species.|$|R
50|$|Cur/Snout - Children {{captured}} by Sharma's army and gradually brainwashed into serving it {{by a combination}} of drugs and psychological conditioning. Because the Bardic ethos considers child soldiery an abomination, the presence of the Curs weakens the defences of the cities they are sent to invade. This impact is enhanced by the ruthlessness of the <b>snouts,</b> who are trained to be merciless or even sadistic, and sometimes by the presence among the <b>snouts</b> of a defender's own child or relative. <b>Snouts</b> are introduced in the third book, wherein Hem infiltrates their training camp in search of his friend Zelika (see below) and accompanies a troop of Curs to Dén Raven.|$|R

5|$|The extant Crocodylidae are twelve {{species in}} the genus Crocodylus, and two species in other genera. They {{have a variety of}} <b>snout</b> shapes, but can be {{recognised}} because the fourth tooth of the lower jaw is visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat <b>snout,</b> {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional {{length of the}} <b>snout</b> decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} the <b>snout,</b> though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} banded sea krait is black, with lateral {{nostrils}} and an undivided rostral scale. The upper lip and <b>snout</b> are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends backward {{on each side of}} the head above the eye to the temporal scales.|$|E
