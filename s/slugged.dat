25|$|At the Battle of Gettysburg the regiment, having 302 men {{present for}} duty, {{was in the}} brigade of Paul J. Semmes in the {{division}} of Lafayette McLaws. On the second day, July 2, 1863, the brigade initially constituted the divisional reserve. During McLaw's assault in the afternoon through Semmes' Brigade was called forward {{to close the gap}} between the other brigades in front of the Wheatfield; the 50th taking an exposed position ahead of the brigade's left. The brigade then <b>slugged</b> it out against elements of Caldwell's division of Hancock's Corps before finally being repulsed. When the present commander of the 50th Georgia, Lt. Col. Kearse, was wounded McGlashan temporarily took command of the regiment until he was superseded later that day. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel. At Gettysburg the records of the regimental losses are unclear and conflicting; the most detailed however give the losses as 16 killed, 62 wounded and 14 missing. When the regimental commander, Col.

25|$|Prior {{to their}} homestand against the Colorado Rockies, Dodger manager Joe Torre {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire {{at the end of}} the season and that Don Mattingly would take over as the Manager for the 2011 season. The Dodgers followed the news with a 7–5 loss to the Rockies. Relief pitcher Octavio Dotel switched dugouts prior to the second game as the Dodgers traded him to the Rockies for a player to be named later. The Dodgers then proceeded to be blown out 12–2 as Troy Tulowitzki <b>slugged</b> two homers and Melvin Mora hit a grand slam, while John Ely was roughed up in the loss. The Dodgers fell behind 6–1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7–6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6–0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3–1 defeat. The Dodgers avoided being swept at home due to Hiroki Kuroda's eight-inning, one-run performance in the Dodgers' 3–1 win over the Padres.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} series against the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw threw seven shutout innings {{in the first game}} of the series, leading the Dodgers to a 6–0 victory. In the second game, the Dodgers dropped the contest 3–2 in ten innings as reliever Octavio Dotel threw three wild pitches that led to the go-ahead run scoring. The Dodgers came up on top in the final game of the series, when Ted Lilly pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout and Reed Johnson hit a two-run home run for the only runs of the game, 2–0. The Cincinnati Reds came to town for the next series. The Reds came into the series with a streak of not having won a game at Dodger Stadium since 2005. They snapped that streak the first game, when Reds starter Homer Bailey shut down the Dodgers offense and the Reds capitalized on a throwing error by Dodger starter Carlos Monasterios to pull out a 3–1 victory. Monasterios started the game after Vicente Padilla was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The Dodgers offense, dormant for much of the second half of the season, finally showed up in the second game of the series. The Dodgers <b>slugged</b> back-to-back homers in both the second and third innings off Reds starter Johnny Cueto and held on for an 8–5 victory. However, the bats vanished again the following day as the Dodgers lost 5–2 despite a strong start from Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 in seven innings. In an effort to bolster their catching corps, depleted by Russell Martin's season-ending injury, the Dodgers acquired Rod Barajas off waivers from the New York Mets on August 22.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slug</b> {{catchers}} {{can be used}} continuously or on-demand. A <b>slug</b> catcher permanently {{connected to}} the pipeline will buffer all production, including the <b>slugs,</b> before it {{is sent to the}} gas and liquid handling facilities. This is used for difficult to predict <b>slugging</b> behaviour found in terrain <b>slugging,</b> hydrodynamic <b>slugging</b> or riser-based <b>slugging.</b> Alternatively, the <b>slug</b> catcher can be bypassed in normal operation and be brought online when a <b>slug</b> is expected, usually during pigging operations. An advantage of this set-up is that inspection and maintenance on the <b>slug</b> catcher can be done without interrupting the normal operation.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to develop a <b>slug</b> {{generator}} that can be used upstream of the Multiphase Capacitive Flow meter (MCF) developed by KSEPL. This meter operates only in the intermittent flow regime. The scope of application should be widened to the stratified and stratified annular flow regime by means of a <b>slug</b> generator. Objectives in the study are the design, modelling and validation of the device, the <b>Slug</b> Generator, meeting requirements for its operation. <b>Slug</b> generator operation requirements consist of an overall <b>slug</b> performance in the stratified and stratified annular flow regime, compact geometry, robustness, low pressure loss and assessment of measurability of the <b>slugs</b> produced. Literature study and <b>slug</b> generator design stages resulted in a device meeting these specifications. This device, the <b>Slug</b> Generator, consists of a kink and an inverted U-tube. Observations of the flow behaviour reveal that the kink continuously propagates shock waves encountering the incoming liquid flow in the pipe sections upstream of the <b>Slug</b> Generator. In this way instabilities are created from which liquid <b>slugs</b> are initiated. These <b>slugs</b> subsequently travel via the inverted U-tube to the downstream pipe, where they continue as liquid <b>slugs</b> over an appreciable pipe length. Such <b>slugs</b> can be used as input to the MCF. <b>Slug</b> Generator performance has been validated in a laboratory scale 2 ft tubing air -' water test loop and a full scale 4 " tubing air - gasoil test loop. The <b>Slug</b> Generator produces <b>slugs</b> over the entire range of validation covering the complete flow map. A deterministic and a probabilistic model of the <b>Slug</b> Generator have been developed. The <b>slug</b> generating mechanism of the <b>Slug</b> Generator bas been implemented in the models. This mechanism consists of a superposition of the hold-up building processes: stratified flow, liquid accumulating, shock wave propagation and <b>slug</b> initiation. The deterministic model computes the critical <b>slug</b> initiation level over the pipe sections upstream of the <b>Slug</b> Generator. The probabilistic model calculates an evolutionary probability density function in the <b>slug</b> generating zone; an upstream pipe section in which <b>slug</b> generation takes place. Both models provide information on <b>slug</b> generating zone length, <b>slug</b> frequency and <b>Slug</b> Generator operation limits. The models have been qualitatively validated in the 2 " and 4 " tubing test loops. The model can be quantitatively improved by adopting an interfacial shear wave model and improving the critical <b>slug</b> initiation level calculation. Pressure drop over the <b>Slug</b> Generator bas been modelled. It has been validated in a laboratory scale 2 " tubing air - water test loop. It is sufficiently accurate in calculating the full scale 4 " tubing air - gasoil test loop. The MCF is able to correlate on the <b>slugs</b> produced by the <b>Slug</b> Generator. It meters satisfactorily without any adjustments to hard- or software in the stratified flow area and {{a small part of the}} stratified annular flow area, whereas it operates normally in its operating envelope. Metering in the stratified flow area is successful if <b>slugs</b> are produced that have steady state characteristics. Therefore the MCF needs to be placed some 35 diameters from the <b>Slug</b> Generator; whereas in annular flow metering is successful if the MCF is placed some 15 diameters from the <b>Slug</b> Generator to prevent the <b>slugs</b> from being blown apart. A MCF position description is still acking. This can he achieved by implementing a model on <b>slug</b> stability, <b>slug</b> hold-up, <b>slug</b> length and <b>slug</b> velocity in the <b>Slug</b> Generator model. MCF performance can be improved by implementing a model on developing <b>slug</b> flow in the software. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|<b>Slugs</b> {{formed by}} terrain <b>slugging,</b> {{hydrodynamic}} <b>slugging</b> or riser-based <b>slugging</b> are periodical in nature. Whether a <b>slug</b> {{is able to}} reach the outlet of the pipeline depends on {{the rate at which}} liquids are added to the <b>slug</b> at the front (i.e. in the direction of flow) and the rate at which liquids leave the <b>slug</b> at the back. Some <b>slugs</b> will grow as they travel the pipeline, while others are damped and disappear before reaching the outlet of the pipeline.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first road trip {{of the second}} half of the season in New York City against the Mets on July 20. Kemp and Luis Cruz each <b>slugged</b> two-run homers off Mets starter Johan Santana and the team held on for a 7-6 victory. Juan Uribe, who had {{struggled}} in the first half of the season, broke out in the next game, with a homer, double, two walks, four RBI and three runs scored. Chris Capuano picked up his team leading 10th win in the 8–5 victory. Matt Treanor's pinch hit two-run single in the top of the 12th inning led the Dodgers to an 8–3 victory over the Mets on July 22. The win completed the Dodgers first 3-game series sweep of the Mets in New York since 2002 and gave rookie Josh Wall the win. Wall was the first Dodger to pick up a win in relief in his first appearance since Tim Belcher in 1987. Billingsley came off the disabled list to pitch six solid innings in the Dodgers 5–3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on July 24. Luis Cruz's three-run homer was main offense in the game. Kershaw struggled in the next game, allowing 8 earned runs, in the Dodgers 8–2 loss to the Cardinals that ended the five-game winning streak. The Dodgers acquired Hanley Ramírez from the Miami Marlins in a trade on July 25 and Ramírez went 2-for-4 with a triple in his Dodgers debut against the Cardinals. It wasn't enough, however, as ex-Dodger Rafael Furcal hit a two-out single to left in the bottom of the 12th to give the Cardinals a 3–2 victory. Chris Capuano turned in his worst start of the season in the finale against the Cardinals, as the Dodgers lost 7–4. Ramírez hit his first home run as a Dodger in the opener of a key series against the division leading Giants. The two-run homer, in the top of the 10th inning was the difference in a 5-3 victory. The Dodgers picked up another win against their rivals the next day as Chad Billingsley pitched 7 scoreless innings while allowing only 4 hits and Matt Kemp went 4 for 5 with two doubles and a home run in the 10–0 rout. Kershaw pitched a five-hit complete game shutout to complete the Dodgers sweep of the Giants, 4–0, and move them back into a tie for first place in the division.|$|E

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster <b>slug</b> and the sabot <b>slug</b> is the wad <b>slug,</b> {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun <b>slug</b> designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster <b>slug,</b> a deep hollow is located in the rear of this <b>slug,</b> which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the <b>slug</b> much like the Foster <b>slug.</b> However, unlike the Foster <b>slug,</b> a wad <b>slug</b> additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the <b>slug</b> while also reducing the amount of expansion of the <b>slug</b> when fired, reducing the stress on the shot wad in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster <b>slugs</b> that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} <b>slug,</b> much like those on the Brenneke, the wad <b>slug</b> is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The wad <b>slug</b> is loaded using a standard shotshell wad, which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the wad <b>slug</b> is slightly less than the nominal bore diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge wad <b>slug,</b> and a wad <b>slug</b> is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the <b>slug</b> is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge wad <b>slug</b> masses include -oz. and 1-oz. wad <b>slugs,</b> and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell wad intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card wad is also sometimes located between the <b>slug</b> and the shotshell wad, depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded wad <b>slug</b> shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|R

50|$|Conservationists {{within the}} Pacific Northwest and BC Canada are {{concerned}} about competition between Arion ater and native <b>slugs</b> such as the banana <b>slug</b> (Ariolimax californicus, A. columbianus, and A. dolichophallus). The University of British Columbia’s zoology department published a study on this interaction in 2015. They determined the two <b>slugs</b> to be functionally different but proposed further studies to determine if black <b>slugs</b> are displacing native <b>slugs.</b> Their study found black <b>slugs</b> were more abundant and consumed a greater quantity of mushrooms than native banana <b>slugs</b> but could not determine reasons for differences in population sizes. They theorized the greater abundance of black <b>slugs</b> could be because the black <b>slug</b> displaced banana <b>slugs</b> or because the black <b>slug</b> might be invading areas with previously low banana <b>slug</b> numbers; however, there is no data for banana <b>slug</b> population sizes prior {{to the arrival of}} Arion ater. This complicates determining if alien <b>slugs</b> have a negative or negligible effect upon native <b>slug</b> numbers. Additionally, this study could not determine if high fungi-consumption resulted from dietary preference or from higher concentrations of alien <b>slugs</b> amidst Douglas fir forests, which promote fungal growth. The study also concluded that black and banana <b>slugs</b> compete for under-story berries. Thankfully, the study demonstrated neither native nor alien <b>slugs</b> consume conifer or fern seedlings. The study demonstrated no significant difference between metabolic rates; however, they concluded the black <b>slug</b> may eat more because of its shorter life span (one compared to several years), requiring faster consumption rates in order to reach sexual maturity. The study demonstrated both <b>slugs</b> benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds and spores. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the two <b>slugs</b> to be functionally different; however, this study proposed further research on the following to determine if black <b>slugs</b> are displacing banana slugs: interactions between Arion ater and fungal communities and comparative studies looking at seed dispersal rates to determine their effect on native, fruit-bearing plant communities.|$|R

500|$|The 1927 New York Yankees team is {{considered}} one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderer's Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2–2 tie. [...] "Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted [...]356, drove in 164 runs and <b>slugged</b> [...]772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, [...] "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she <b>slugged</b> from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Slugs</b> need be fed {{regularly}} so {{that they}} remain healthy, and baby <b>slugs</b> need extra special care to help them mature. If experienced enough, <b>slugs</b> can evolve into an even stronger form called a Mega Morph. To Mega Morph a <b>slug</b> needs to be shot at two hundred miles per hour, but the <b>slug</b> has {{to be ready to}} handle the extra speed and power. If a <b>slug</b> is not experienced enough, it will get thrown off by the speed and the Mega Morph will fail. By equipping your blaster with an accelerator, the slinger can help a <b>slug</b> Mega Morph more easily. <b>Slugs</b> are kept in special cylinder-shaped cases called <b>slug</b> tubes.|$|R
50|$|The black <b>slug</b> (also {{known as}} black arion, European black <b>slug,</b> or large black <b>slug)</b> Arion ater L. {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} gastropod mollusk in the family Arionidae—the round back <b>slugs.</b> Land <b>slugs</b> lack shells like other terrestrial mollusks (such as snails). Without such shells, <b>slugs</b> produce unappetizing mucus—that may also contain toxins—to deter predators. Additionally, terrestrial <b>slugs</b> produce two other forms of mucus that facilitate locomotion and prevent death from drying. Such mollusks are hermaphroditic preferring to find mates. <b>Slugs</b> most often function as decomposers but are also often omnivores. Arion ater is one such <b>slug,</b> decomposing organic matter, preying on other organisms, and consuming vegetative matter—including agricultural crops. Native to Europe, the black <b>slug</b> is an invasive species in Australia, Canada (British Columbia, Newfoundland, Quebec), and the United States—Pacific Northwest.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the behaviour of a steam <b>slug</b> which was rising in an isothermal vertical pipe at a reduced pressure. When {{the water temperature}} around the steam <b>slug</b> was higher than the saturated temperature, the <b>slug</b> grew upon rising in the pipe. The temperature difference between the steam <b>slug</b> and the surrounding water was increased, when water velocity in the pipe was increased or a static pressure to the system was decreased. The increase in velocity of {{the leading edge of}} a rising steam <b>slug</b> was caused by the <b>slug</b> growth. But the trailing edge velocity of a steam <b>slug</b> was equal to that of an air <b>slug</b> without growth in water. As the water temperature around the tip of the steam <b>slug</b> was locally higher than the mean flow temperature, it was regarded that the liquid vaporization, which caused the <b>slug</b> growth, occured at the front face of the <b>slug...</b>|$|R
