25|$|However, {{although}} Transpersonal psychology {{has experienced}} recognition {{from the surrounding}} culture, it has also faced {{a fair amount of}} skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings. Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of Transpersonal psychology. Zdenek, representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inception. Other commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the field. In 1998 the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the holistic studies program at the John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, which included a Transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Several commentators presented their skepticism towards the program. Another controversial aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic <b>substances.</b> <b>Commenting</b> upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald & Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement. The authors do however note {{that this is not the}} most common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy.|$|R

2500|$|Natasha Kassulke of the Wisconsin State Journal stated [...] "The concert {{captured}} {{the scope of}} Jackson's talent from songwriter to singer, producer, actress, dancer and fashion diva." [...] Similarly, Gemma Tarlach of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel observed, [...] "A tiny dynamo of constant motion, Jackson strutted, slunk and grooved her way {{from one end of}} the stage to the other... Her voice, sometimes thin and girlish on her albums, sounded fuller and more powerful than ever. Michael's baby sister? Nope, the commander of her own rhythm nation, in complete control. The show was as much a feast visually as musically." [...] Kevin Johnson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch commended the tour as [...] "one of the flashiest on the concert scene." [...] Elizabeth Aird, who reviewed Jackson's concert at GM Place, wrote [...] "If there's a show sexier and more polished than Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope extravaganza, it's only on Broadway... Saturday night's show at GM Place was two hours of thrills pumped out by Jackson, her never-say-die dancers and her powerful band." [...] James Sullivan of the San Francisco Chronicle observed her concert at the new arena [...] "offered a career retrospective, punctuated by new material, periodic video diversions and fireworks." [...] "The show was a lot like an '80s flashback, though to its credit Jackson's eight-piece band—bass, guitar, drums and percussion, two keyboardists and two backup singers—added some inventive layering to her older hits." [...] Charles Passy of the Palm Beach Post reported Jackson's show at the Coral Sky Amphitheatre emphasized style over <b>substance,</b> <b>commenting</b> her [...] "two-hour set was about half hormones—and half pyrotechnics. Without much in the way of a voice, she has sold her persona throughout her career. And as that persona has evolved from girlish teenager to sexually sophisticated woman, her albums—and tours—have provided a road map." [...] Jet Magazine reported, [...] "With wit, sass, dance and a whole lot of sex appeal, Janet turns her song and dance fest into one of the major musical events of the year. In fact, it has become the must-see concert of the year." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper replies to Bix and Soper (Bix 2007; Soper 2007). Bix’s paper raises methodological questions, {{especially}} {{whether a}} form-theorist merely needs {{to reflect on}} form from the arm-chair so to speak. A variety of methods is called for, including conceptual analysis, study of usage, “education in the obvious, ” general reflection {{on the nature of}} specific functional legal units, empirical research on their operation and effects, and still more. Further methodological remarks are made in response to Soper’s paper. Soper suggests the possibility of substituting “form v. substance ” of a unit as the central contrast here rather than form v. complementary material or other components of a unit. Various reasons are given here for not doing this. Among other things, it is also argued here that form does not, contrary to Soper’s suggestion, always follow <b>substance.</b> 1. <b>Comments</b> on Bix’s Remarks 1 Bix refers to my plea for a “renewed focus on form. ” It is true that I seek to clarify what form is in functional legal units; demonstrate how form is an avenue for advancing understanding of such units; identify the credi...|$|R
2500|$|A survey {{investigating}} 12,000 {{cases of}} alleged SRA {{found that most}} were diagnosed with DID as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The level of dissociation {{in a sample of}} women alleging SRA was found to be higher than a comparable sample of non-SRA peers, approaching the levels shown by patients diagnosed with DID. A sample of patients diagnosed with DID and reporting childhood SRA also present other symptoms including [...] "dissociative states with satanic overtones, severe post-traumatic stress disorder, survivor guilt, bizarre self abuse, unusual fears, sexualization of sadistic impulses, indoctrinated beliefs, and <b>substance</b> abuse". <b>Commenting</b> on the study, Philip Coons stated that patients were held together in a ward dedicated to dissociative disorders with ample opportunity to socialize, and that the memories were recovered through the use of hypnosis (which he considered questionable). No cases were referred to law enforcement for verification, nor was verification attempted through family members. Coons also pointed out that existing injuries could have been self-inflicted, that the experiences reported were [...] "strikingly similar" [...] and that [...] "many of the SRA reports developed while patients were hospitalized". The reliability of memories of DID clients who alleged SRA in treatment has been questioned and a point of contention in the popular media and with clinicians; many of the allegations made are fundamentally impossible and alleged survivors lack the physical scars that would result were their allegations true.|$|R
5000|$|Rather than {{beginning}} her racing {{career in}} a maiden race, Nahoodh made her {{debut in the}} Group Two Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 11 July and finished twelfth of the fourteen runners behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained You'resothrilling. She was dropped to maiden class for a contest at Ascot Racecourse later that month and started the 11/4 favourite against fifteen opponents. She struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight and although she finished strongly she finished third, beaten a head and a short head by Albabilia and Naomh Geileis. Nahoodh was moved back up to Group Two class for the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse {{in which she was}} ridden by Jamie Spencer and started 15/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Visit (winner of the Princess Margaret Stakes), Fleeting Spirit (Molecomb Stakes) and You'resothrilling. After being restrained by Spencer {{at the rear of the}} nine-runner field she was switched to the outside and began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile. She overtook Fleeting Spirit a furlong out and held off a late challenge from Visit to win by half a length. The runner-up was later disqualified after testing positive for a banned <b>substance.</b> Spencer <b>commented</b> [...] "She has loads of talent but wouldn't settle early. I went earlier than I normally would because you can get away with it on outsiders, and I took a chance".|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to make a}} {{critical}} study and analysis of the poetry in Spirit during the nine years of its publication, 1934 - 1943. The problem is to determine whether or not: the purpose of the magazine is realized, its standards are maintained, there is any progress or development in the quality of the poetry, the subject matter is within the range stipulated by the editors and the Catholic Poetry Society. As no critical study has been made in this field, the magazines themselves, rather than an extensive bibliography, furnish the most satisfying source and the most efficient tool for the study here undertaken. Current books on modern poetry and criticism were used as guides. The evaluation is {{to be based on the}} definitions and principles of poetry as outlined by the members of the Society. The study will include a summary of Spirit 2 ̆ 7 s literary criticism, a study of the poetry as to <b>substance</b> and form, <b>comments</b> on the authors, and a conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{personal}} freedom Alaskans not only expect, but rely upon, exposes a significant need for federal {{cooperation in the}} reformation of marijuana laws, including the removal or reclassification of marijuana in the Controlled <b>Substances</b> Act. This <b>Comment</b> summarizes this issue in light of Alaska’s recent recreational marijuana legalization. In doing so, elements unique to Alaska and their likely influence on the state 2 ̆ 7 s upcoming marijuana legislation; the history and evolution of Alaska marijuana laws; and the scholarly literature on Alaska marijuana law regarding the tensions between federal and state marijuana regulation are discussed. This Comment proposes that marijuana {{be removed from the}} Controlled Substance Act and that the federal government take a page out of Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s book in setting up a new marijuana regulatory system by shifting oversight of marijuana regulation from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Such a solution could provide for consistency among the continuing emergence of state recreational marijuana laws while still allowing each state to properly police itself {{on the basis of its}} unique needs...|$|R
40|$|Teranishi (2007) investigates {{whether the}} {{financial}} system prior to World War II was an indirect system led by banks, as {{it was during the}} high-growth period, or whether it was a direct system led by equity and other capital markets. On this question, Teranishi has long argued that large-enterprise capital-raising primarily took the form of equity, while the broader macro-level, private nonfinancial sector raised most of its funding in the form of bank borrowings, just as it did after the war. Teranishi (2007) reorganizes this argument, develops it, and adds further consideration of the qualitative capabilities of banks and equity markets. In the process, he notes that in my research to date I have argued that the prewar financial system was basically an indirect system led by banks, and that is indeed what I have maintained, but Teranishi (2007) has caused me to reflect on whether the argument for indirect finance really holds up, and those reflections are the <b>substance</b> of the <b>comments</b> presented in this paper. Before examining this issue, we must first confirm the vantage point from which we are determining whether finance is considered direct or indirect. Teranishi (2007) notes this conceptual problem in Fujino and Teranishi (2000, p. 148), commenting: “One must consider how to handle cases in which the borrowers of bank loans use the proceeds to purchase equity and bonds from nonfinancial enterprises; bank lendin...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. July 2011. Major: Science, technology, and {{environmental}} policy. Advisor: Jennifer Kuzma. 1 computer file (PDF); v, 107 pages. For the oversight of emerging technologies and their products, public comment periods on proposed federal rules {{is one of}} the most popular methods of gaining public insight into public values and opinions about emerging technologies in federal rulemaking. Many science and technology scholars suggest that this level of participation is not effective, or broad enough according to democratic and ethical principles. In this analysis, we set out to examine this issue using the case study of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) in the food supply and recent proposed rule changes coming from the primary regulatory body for these products, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Services (USDA-APHIS). This paper addresses the issue of public participation looking at the following areas of research: 1) what are the substantial differences between the old and new proposed regulations for GEOs, 2) what stakeholder groups comment on proposed rules 3) what do the comments say about the proposed rule (as expressed through formal public comments on the Federal Register notice) and 4) to what degree should these comments be taken into consideration by the agency in final rule-making process? Stakeholder groups that have participated in the comment period on this new rule have been identified and the <b>substance</b> of their <b>comments</b> have been examined in order to consider group-diversity and potential patterns of opinions based on affiliation, expertise, demographics, or culture to determine the extent and substance of participation through comment and rule making. Stakeholders were identified, and public comments from these stakeholders were analyzed based on thematic coding schemes in the software NVivo. Areas were identified from these comments that need to be addressed if APHIS should choose to publish the final rule. The method of public participation also was examined using democratic theory and the literature on public participation, including perspectives and social goals of public participation. Negotiated rulemaking was identified as a method to resolve conflict between competing interests and educate and inform the public about issues...|$|R
