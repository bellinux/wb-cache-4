40|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{is central}} to the treatment of many poisonings. When it was placed on the FDA drug shortage list in 2012, alternative treatment strategies to specific poisonings were considered. Many hospital pharmacies, poison centers, and medical toxicologists proposed <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> as an adequate alternative, despite a paucity of data to support its use in medical toxicology. The intention of this review is to educate the clinician on the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> and to advise them on the potential adverse events when given in excess. We conducted a literature search focused on the pharmacology of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate,</b> its use as a buffer in pathologic acidemia and dialysis baths, and potential adverse events associated with excess <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusion.

The increase in the response to <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> was observed up to 6 hr, but not at 12 hr after exposure. To clarify the mechanism of this enhancement of the chemotactic response, several mutants were used. The chemotactic response of pre-exposed tph- 1 and bas- 1 mutants, whose main defect was serotonin secretion, was enhanced in comparison with that of the control mutants (p < 0. 01). However, cat- 1 and cat- 2 mutants, which are respectively defective in serotonin and dopamine secretion and dopamine secretion only, showed no enhancement of the chemotactic response to <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate,</b> even when pre-exposed to this chemical. When the cat- 1 and cat- 2 mutants were pre-exposed to <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> and bred in the presence of 40 mM dopamine, these mutants showed enhanced chemotactic response to <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> (p < 0. 05).

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} nitrites and sulfites as food {{preservatives}} {{has been}} {{a cause for concern}} due to the health problems that these additives can cause in humans. Natural products have been studied as an alternative, but most of them have hardly been applied in the food industry for technological and economic reasons. In this sense, organic salts such as <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> are a good alternative due to their affordability. Thus, this study evaluated the capacity of sodium nitrite, sodium sulfite, a <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> product (TQI C- 6000), and chitosan to inhibit two important foodborne pathogens, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. The MIC of each chemical was in vitro evaluated and their antibacterial action was subsequently checked in situ using minced meat as a food model. MIC values of sodium nitrite (10, 000 mg/L) and sodium sulfite (50, 000 mg/L) for Salmonella enterica were higher than the values allowed by legislation (450 mg/L for sulfites and 150 mg/L for nitrites). Additionally, the <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> product caused the inhibition of Salmonella enterica and Listeria at a relative low quantity. The two foodborne pathogens were inhibited in the food model with 1 % of the <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> product. Additionally, {{there were no significant differences}} between sodium nitrite, sodium sulfite, and <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> products in the inhibition of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes in the food model.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> {{has been}} shown to cause hemodynamic {{instability}} when used as a hemodialysis buffer. The pattern of hemodynamic response to injury will be evaluated between those who received <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> and those who did not. The primary purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> on hemodynamic parameters. Secondarily we looked at the effects on prevention and treatment of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Methods The study arm was comprised of patients who had received <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusions in place of normal saline between March 2005 and December 2009. A control arm was created based on matching three pre-treatment variables: injury severity score (ISS), pH (+/- 0. 03) and base deficit (+/- 3). A retrospective chart review was performed for patients in both arms. Blood pressure, arterial blood gas data and chemistry values were recorded for the time points of - 6, - 1, 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours from start of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusion. Patients were excluded based on the following criteria: patients who were given sodium bicarbonate within 48 hours of starting <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate,</b> those given <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> as a bolus, non-trauma patients, burn patients, patients who expired within 24 hours of arrival to the ICU, patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and patients whose medical record could not be obtained. Results A total of 78 patients were included in the study, 39 in the study arm and 39 in the control arm. There were no statistically significant drops in blood pressure within either group. The median pH between the two groups at the start of infusion was equal. Both groups trended towards normal pH with the study arm improving faster than the control arm. The median serum bicarbonate at start of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusion was 19 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L at time zero for the study and control arms respectively with both trending upward during the study period. Chloride trended up initially in both groups but the study arm began to correct sooner at 24 hours compared to 48 hours for the control arm. Conclusion We analyzed the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> as an alternative to normal saline or lactated ringers during resuscitation of critically ill trauma patients at a single center. Our data shows that the hemodynamic profile remained favorable, without evidence of instability at any point during the study period.
