[...] In the past several years, SPS students have (in <b>simulation)</b> <b>run</b> congressional campaigns, negotiated {{their way through a}} dangerous crisis with North Korea, taken steps to contain a flu pandemic sweeping the nation, and argued and decided Supreme Court cases on First Amendment and national security issues. [...] In the [...] "real" [...] world, the SPS students have, among other things, visited the White House to talk with the White House Chief of Staff, had lunch with the Governor of Maryland, hosted a formal dinner for Ambassadors from around the world, attended screenings of [...] "Meet the Press" [...] and talked with host David Gregory, met with members of the U.S. Supreme Court, and chatted about fiscal policy with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.|$|E

30|$|A typical testcase for {{performance}} characterization contains a large set of very similar <b>simulation</b> <b>runs,</b> which differ only in channel realization, noise realization, or received signal strength. To avoid having a different testcase {{for each of}} these very similar <b>simulation</b> <b>runs,</b> testcases can contain multiple <b>simulation</b> <b>runs.</b> These runs differ only by few parameters. The missing notion of relative timing among <b>simulation</b> <b>runs</b> calls for an even finer grained structure: each run is again sequenced into phases which can be timed relative to each other. This is required for functional verification of sequences of several transmit and/or receive simulations.|$|R

30|$|Finally, the {{evaluation}} of a simulation study {{is based on a}} statistical analysis. A simulation usually captures the dynamics of complex systems. In the context of logistics, the delivery locations will change day-by-day, and so will the delivery routes. To account for these dynamics and still derive a general idea of how the system behaves, different <b>simulation</b> <b>runs</b> have to be executed. In this context, it is important to choose a sufficient number of <b>simulation</b> <b>runs</b> and a sufficient length of each run. The target metrics will then be computed as the average over all <b>simulation</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{data points}} {{presented}} in the simulation results were calculated as the average of ten <b>simulation</b> <b>runs</b> to eliminate the effect of any anomalous individual result because we observed a realistic variance among the points using ten or more <b>simulation</b> <b>runs.</b> We plotted the 95 % confidence interval as error bars on the figures.|$|R

50|$|Once defined, these {{test scripts}} are {{executed}} during the <b>simulation</b> <b>run,</b> when the TPNS program ITPENTER (the simulator) processes the submitted statements and creates data streams in the required formats and protocols, prior to {{sending them to}} the system under test {{as if they had}} originated from real user(s) operating real terminal(s). In turn, the target application(s) running in the system under test respond(s) to the simulated terminal(s) and, if the simulation is successful, these exchanges would continue until the programmed scripts reach the end of the <b>simulation</b> <b>run,</b> at which time ITPENTER is terminated by the test programmer.|$|E
5000|$|Simulation acceleration: Simulating huge designs with an HDL {{simulator}} is a tedious task. When {{the designer}} transfers {{parts of the}} design to an emulation system and co-simulates them with the HDL simulation, the <b>simulation</b> <b>run</b> times can be decreased.|$|E

50|$|Source-code {{annotation}} is {{a feature}} of debugging tools such as GTKWave that allows values from a <b>simulation</b> <b>run</b> to be viewable directly in the source code. This allows for viewing of values at a given point in time rather than longitudinally across many time values.|$|E
50|$|With V3R5 (1998), IBM {{introduced}} the TPNS Test Manager which added substantial automation features that streamline many repetitive tasks associated with planning, preparing, operating and analyzing a TPNS-based <b>simulation</b> <b>run,</b> while still enabling the test programmer optionally to retain full awareness, in real-time, {{of the events}} unfolding at every step and to intervene if necessary.|$|E
