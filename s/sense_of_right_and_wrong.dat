He owns the First, Second, and Third Keys, but is not in {{possession}} of them {{throughout most of the}} book. Arthur shows a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> as well as a reliance on friends and allies to achieve his goal: the rightful mastery of the entire House.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by {{the ideology of the}} free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{has a deep}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and a {{conviction}} that it is right to intervene when injustice occurs, which sets him apart from his own people, the Time Lords, and their strict ethic of non-intervention.|$|E

25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a man like that. After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|Steven first {{appears in}} the serial The Chase, when the Doctor and his {{companion}}s, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki, find him on the planet Mechanus where he crash-landed two years before. He joins the Doctor and Vicki as a companion in the following serial, The Time Meddler, when they discover that he stowed-away in the TARDIS after having escaped the burning Mechanoid City. Steven is a strong-willed individual, who is more capable when there is something physical to do than when there is thinking to be done. He has a finely developed <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and places {{a high value on}} human life.|$|E
5000|$|One of the Suitors, Ctesippus of Same is {{described}} as [...] "a man who had no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong" [...] and attempts to throw an ox's hoof from the meat-basket of the dinner table at Odysseus.|$|R
50|$|There {{are still}} many other elements, such as chéng (誠/诚, honesty), shù (恕, {{kindness}} and forgiveness), lián (廉, honesty and cleanness), chǐ (恥/耻, shame, judge <b>and</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong),yǒng (勇, bravery), wēn (溫/温, kind and gentle), liáng (良, good, kindhearted), gōng (恭, respectful, reverent), jiǎn (儉/俭, frugal), ràng (讓/让, modestly, self-effacing).|$|R

25|$|The term is used {{in various}} {{different}} ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, {{but in some cases}} the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> from the average person.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E
25|$|By 1998, Lawler rarely {{wrestled}} in the WWF {{and focused}} on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF {{for the first time}} and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far. He would become a full-time face by 2007. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} {{that she was still}} pledged to Gregory, and that she had loved him once. Both facts had to be admitted, and {{it seemed to her that}} if he insisted she must marry him. Deep down in her there was an innate <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> honesty, and she {{realized}} that the fact that he was not the man she had once imagined him to be did not release her. It was clear that, if he was about to commit a cruel and unjustifiable action, she was the one person of all others whose part it was to restrain him.|$|R

500|$|Although Skirth {{had volunteered}} for the Army in 1915, as an idealistic patriot, {{convinced}} that [...] "King and Country" [...] were causes worth fighting for, [...] {{it was not long}} before he became disillusioned with the war and the army. He attributed this to a combination of his sensitive character, his Christian upbringing and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and, most significantly, the horror of his war experiences.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins {{states that he}} agrees with Robert Hinde's Why Good is Good, Michael Shermer's The Science of Good and Evil, Robert Buckman's Can We Be Good Without God? and Marc Hauser's Moral Minds, that our <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> {{can be derived from}} our Darwinian past. Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as whatever it is that makes us behave well when nobody is looking... Those who believe that the existence of conscience is a proof of a godly design are advancing an argument that simply cannot be disproved because there is no evidence for or against it." ...|$|E

Oldman was Nolan's first choice for Ra's al Ghul, but when Chris Cooper turned down the part of Gordon to spend time with his family Nolan decided that it would be {{refreshing}} for Oldman, who is renowned for his portrayals of villains, to play the role instead. [...] "I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> good and bad and justice," [...] Oldman said of his character.

60|$|It is {{well known}} how dreadfully the Nawaub kept this promise, and {{how he and his}} son {{afterwards}} sunk before the discipline and bravery of the Europeans. The scene of just punishment which he so faithfully exhibited might be owing to his policy, his internal <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> to the ostentation of displaying it before an Englishman <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> and intelligence, or to all of these motives mingled together--but in what proportions it is not for us to distinguish.|$|R
40|$|Current law-and-development {{literature}} overwhelmingly urges {{the privatization}} {{of the economy and}} the establishment of a rule-of-law system, which endows citizens with <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> obligations, with the expectation that democracy and equality will inevitably follow. However, the above excerpts from my research interviewing female Chinese divorce litigants about their experiences in the Chinese court system capture a much more ambiguous effect of Chinese reforms on its citizens 2 ̆ 7 <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> entitlements. This article looks at China 2 ̆ 7 s recent legal reform through the eyes of male and female divorce litigants, and examines the kinds <b>of</b> citizenship <b>rights</b> that are being promoted through the Chinese court system. Are the changes occurring within the Chinese legal system encouraging a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> citizenship <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> equality amongst its citizens? How has the Chinese court system benefited its most vulnerable citizens? Are Chinese legal reforms consistent with its citizens 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of justice...|$|R
60|$|My <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> {{justice was}} {{beginning}} to assert itself, and I felt quite indignant with the fellow. Two minutes ago, as I have explained, I could contemplate the taking of another man's seat with equanimity. Now, such an act seemed to me shameful. The truth is that my better nature never sleeps for long. Leave it alone and it wakens of its own accord. Heaven help me! I am a sinful, worldly man, I know; but there is good {{at the bottom of}} me. It wants hauling up, but it's there.|$|R
500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity.

And that plays out {{for the rest of your}} life." [...] McCanlies added that films can provide viewers with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would [...] "make us feel like we're all part of humanity [...] is something we need to feel."

500|$|Betty's two passions in {{life are}} darts and food. Playing darts brings out her {{competitive}} side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her [...] "homely and comfortable" [...] figure. Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: [...] "I had to [...] between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he'd have married one." [...] Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: [...] "Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn't face life alone at home". Little has observed that Betty [...] "has a finely tuned <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> {{and has never been}} afraid to stand up for her beliefs", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The Smiths {{involved}} themselves {{heavily in}} local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers; he {{also became a}} founder member of the Selukwe Freemasons' Lodge and President of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community. [...] "My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> of integrity, in their children," [...] Ian Smith wrote in his memoirs. [...] "They set wonderful examples to live up to."

He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs."

40|$|These {{words were}} penned in 1867 by Father Venancio Garrido, a Benedictine monk at New Norcia Aboriginal mission in Western Australia (see Map 4. 1). They {{form part of}} his lengthy report on the mission which was {{requested}} by the Colonial Secretary to be forwarded to the Aborigines Protection Society in London. In 1871 Father Garrido’s report was collated alongside other ‘information’ about Aborigines in Western Australia that had been collected by missionaries and government agents, and was printed by the government printer. The above statement suggests two issues which I will draw out in this chapter: the Aboriginal residents at New Norcia had a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong; and the Benedictine community at New Norcia considered them to be the original owners of the land which was, in 1867, increasingly occupied by pastoralists...|$|R
60|$|To know good <b>and</b> evil, <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong--to have a conscience, a moral sense--that is the {{likeness}} of God of which I wish to preach to-day.

It is through our moral sense that God speaks to us; through our <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> wrong; through that I say, God speaks to us, whether in reproof or encouragement, in wrath or in love; to teach us what he is like, and to teach us what he is not like.|$|R

[...] The article {{which was based on}} that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: [...] "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded {{it in such a way}} that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{scored the}} game a 9.1/10 {{and said that}} [...] "anyone looking for a first-person shooter that offers more than flat, stereotypical {{characters}} and copy-and-paste supersoldier plots, one that attempts to establish a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> and loops you into the decision making process, and one that's set {{in one of the}} most vividly realized settings around should pick up BioShock 2. It's a game in which story, setting, and gameplay are expertly blended to create an experience that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining." [...] IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have seen it before, and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, the twists and turns seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.|$|E
