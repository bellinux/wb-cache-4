The various presented algorithms introduce different trade-offs between the accuracy and the computation complexity. While all our schemes are global, they employ simple pair-wise measurements between neighboring nodes. Consequently, all the algorithms presented in the paper, are simple, easy to implement and require a modest amount of measurement and control traffic. I...|$|E

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) {{has always}} been {{in a world of}} its own, but as the {{technology}} has been refined and has evolved in recent years, QOS usage has increased {{to the point where it}} is now considered a necessary part of network design and operation. As with most technologies, large- scale deployments have led to the technology becoming more mature, and QOS is no exception. The current trend in the networking world is convergence, abandoning the concept of several separate physical networks in which each one carries specific types of traffic, moving towards a single, common physical network infrastructure. The major business driver associated with this trend is cost reduction: one network carrying traffic and delivering services that previously demanded several separate physical networks requires fewer resources to achieve the same goal. One of the most striking examples is voice traffic, which was previously supported on circuit- switched networks and is now starting to be delivered on the “ same common ” packet- <b>switched</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The inherent drawback in having a common network is that the road is now the same for different traffic types, which poses the challenge of how to achieve a peaceful co-existence among them since they are all competing for the same network resources. Allowing fair and even competition by having no traffic differentiation does not work because different types of traffic have different requirements, just like an ambulance and a truck on the same road have different needs. The first attempt to solve this problem was to make the road wider, that is, to deploy network resources in an over- provisioned manner following the logic that although the split of resources was not ideal, so many free resources would be available at all times that the problem would be minimized. However, this approach works against the major business driver behind network convergence, which is cost reduction. Even more, such over- provisioning needs to be done not only for the steady state but also to take into account possible network failure scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Recent {{development}} on Ethernet switching to provide Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) on network interface cards (NICs) improves Ethernet throughput for Virtual Machines (VMs) and lowers CPU loads. SR-IOV creates multiple receive queues on a NIC, directly accessible by VMs for frames coming from sources {{external to the}} Ethernet port. This virtualization of Ethernet ports and the presentation of frames directly to VMs eliminates a major cause for CPU loading by reducing the interrupts for receipt of inbound frames. However, SR-IOV cannot provide switching support for two VMs on the same computer; the only existing switching option is software-based switching in the hypervisor, which limits throughput and results in high CPU utilization. New industry standards 802. 1 Qbg and 802. 1 Qbh assist Ethernet traffic between VMs, but they require costly replacement of both Ethernet NICs and the data center external physical <b>switch</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In this paper, we propose a new design by integrating a new Ethernet switching functionality into the NIC, which is called nSwitch, to enable hardwarebased switching for inter-VM traffic on a single computer that has a single or multi-socket, multi-core CPU. Compared with software-based switching in the hypervisor, this enhancement greatly reduces CPU utilization and permits efficient traffic monitoring for on-board inter-VM I/O. Furthermore, it eliminates the back-and-forth usage of external port or channel bandwidth for internal VM communications...|$|R

It is an embodiment of the software-defined networking paradigm, in which higher-level flow routing decisions are derived from a control layer that, unlike classic network switch implementations, is separated from the data handling layer. The central attraction to this paradigm is that by decoupling the control logic from the closed and proprietary implementations of traditional network <b>switch</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> researchers can more easily design and distribute innovative flow handling and network control algorithms. Indeed, we also believe that OpenFlow can, in time, prove to be one of the more impactful technologies to drive a variety of innovations in network security. Open-Flow could offer a dramatic simplification to the way we design and integrate complex network security applications into large networks. However, to date there remains a stark paucity of compelling OpenFlow security applications. In this paper, we introduce FRESCO, an OpenFlow security application development framework designed to facilitate the rapid design, and modular composition of OF-enabled detection and mitigation modules. FRESCO, which is itself an OpenFlow application, offers a Click-inspired [19] programming framework that enables security researchers to implement, share, and compose together, many different security detection and mitigation modules. We demonstrate the utility of FRESCO through the implementation of several well-known security defenses as OpenFlow security services, and use them to examine various performance and efficiency aspects of our proposed framework. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Software-defined {{networks}} (SDNs) pose both {{an opportunity}} and {{challenge to the}} network security community. The opportunity lies {{in the ability of}} SDN applications to express intelligent and agile threat mitigation logic against hostile flows, without the need for specialized inline hardware. However, the SDN community lacks a secure control-layer to manage the interactions between the application layer and the <b>switch</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (the data plane). There are no available SDN controllers that provide the key security features, trust models, and policy mediation logic, necessary to deploy multiple SDN applications into a highly sensitive computing environment. We propose the design of security extensions at the control layer to provide the security management and arbitration of conflicting flow rules that arise when multiple applications are deployed within the same network. We present a prototype of our design as a Security Enhanced version of the widely used OpenFlow Floodlight Controller, which we call SE-Floodlight. SE-Floodlight extends Floodlight with a security-enforcement kernel (SEK) layer, whose functions are also directly applicable to other OpenFlow controllers. The SEK adds a unique set of secure appli-cation management features, including an authentication service, role-based authorization, a permission model for mediating all configuration change requests to the data-plane, inline flow-rule conflict resolution, and a security audit service. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our system implementation through both a comprehensive functionality assessment and a performance evaluation that illustrates its sub-linear scaling properties.

The inputs to the virtual topology design problem are the physical topology, the traffic matrix and the regular topology. In this paper, this problem is both tackled directly and by decomposition into two subproblems. The first subproblem - dilation minimization - uses only the physical topology and the virtual topology as optimization inputs. Node placement optimization - the second subproblem - considers the traffic matrix and virtual topology as inputs. The solutions of these two subproblems are compared {{with each other and}} against the results obtained when the global problem is optimized directly (using all three possible input parameters) for a variety of traffic scenarios. This gives insight into the relative importance of the physical topology and traffic matrix when designing a regular virtual topology for optical packet switching. Regardless of the approach adopted, the problem is intractable, and hence, heuristics must be used to find (near) optimal solutions expeditiously. Five optimization heuristics, using different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, are employed in this paper. The results obtained by the heuristics for the three alternative design approaches are compared under a variety of traffic scenarios. An important conclusion of this paper is that the traffic matrix plays a less significant role than is conventionally assumed, and only a marginal penalty is incurred by disregarding it in several of the traffic cases considered. In fact, it was found {{that it is possible to}} design the regular virtual topology without using the traffic matrix, and yet, the solution is close to optimal for a range of traffic scenarios and relatively immune to traffic fluctuations...|$|R
