5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce <b>syngas,</b> a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of <b>syngas</b> to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} <b>syngas</b> fuels a {{combustion turbine}} that produces electricity. At this stage the <b>syngas</b> is fairly pure H2.|$|E
25|$|Gasifiers offer a {{flexible}} option for thermal applications, {{as they can}} be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as ovens, furnaces, boilers, etc., where <b>syngas</b> may replace fossil fuels. Heating values of <b>syngas</b> are generally around 4–10 MJ/m3.|$|E
25|$|If the refiner {{wants to}} produce gasoline, the <b>syngas</b> is {{collected}} at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the <b>syngas</b> is {{fed into the}} water gas shift reaction, where more hydrogen is liberated.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{gasification}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} <b>syngas,</b> a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) gas. Often <b>syngas</b> is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity, but the versatility of <b>syngas</b> also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the Fischer-Tropsch process; alternatively, <b>syngas</b> can be converted into methanol, which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process. Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is currently used by the Sasol chemical company of South Africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a hydrogen economy, making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} called {{integrated}} because (1) the <b>syngas</b> {{produced in the}} gasification section is used as fuel for the gas turbine in the combined cycle and (2) the steam produced by the <b>syngas</b> coolers in the gasification section {{is used by the}} steam turbine in the combined cycle.|$|E
25|$|All coal gasification-based {{conversion}} processes require {{removal of}} hydrogen sulfide (H2S; an acid gas) from the <b>syngas</b> {{as part of}} the overall plant configuration. Typical acid gas removal (AGR) processes employed for gasification design are either a chemical solvent system (e.g., amine gas treating systems based on MDEA, for example) or a physical solvent system (e.g., Rectisol or Selexol). Process selection is mostly dependent on the <b>syngas</b> cleanup requirement and costs. Conventional chemical/physical AGR processes using MDEA, Rectisol or Selexol are commercially proven technologies and can be designed for selective removal of CO2 in addition to H2S from a <b>syngas</b> stream. For significant capture of CO2 from a gasification plant (e.g., > 80%) the CO in the <b>syngas</b> must first be converted to CO2 and hydrogen (H2) via a water-gas-shift (WGS) step upstream of the AGR plant.|$|E
25|$|Coal is an {{important}} feedstock in production {{of a wide range}} of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is coal gasification to produce <b>syngas.</b> Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the <b>syngas</b> include methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including olefins, acetic acid, formaldehyde, ammonia, urea and others. The versatility of <b>syngas</b> as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the final}} fuel form, {{gasification}} itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and <b>syngas</b> conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO2 emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the <b>syngas.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Syngas</b> {{can also}} be used for further {{processing}} to liquid fuels or chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Lower-temperature {{gasification}} {{is desirable}} when co-producing biochar, but results in <b>syngas</b> polluted with tar.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{processing}} (Gas to liquids) of the <b>syngas</b> {{may produce}} other synthetic fuels instead of electricity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syngas,</b> {{a mixture}} of carbon monoxide, {{hydrogen}} and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of oxygen that {{is not sufficient to}} convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water. Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes pyrolysed. The resulting gas mixture, <b>syngas,</b> is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.|$|E
25|$|The {{gasification}} {{process can}} produce <b>syngas</b> {{from a wide}} variety of carbon-containing feedstocks, such as high-sulfur coal, heavy petroleum residues, and biomass.|$|E
25|$|Chemrec's {{pilot plant}} in Piteå that has {{produced}} 3MW of clean <b>syngas</b> since 2006, generated from entrained flow gasification of black liquor.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessary}} extensive {{flue gas}} cleaning may be performed on the <b>syngas</b> instead of the much larger volume of flue gas after combustion.|$|E
25|$|Ash {{is formed}} in {{gasification}} from inorganic impurities in the coal. Some of these impurities {{react to form}} microscopic solids which can be suspended in the <b>syngas</b> produced by gasification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syngas</b> may {{be burned}} {{directly}} in internal combustion engines, turbines or high-temperature fuel cells. The wood gas generator, a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can {{be connected to}} an internal combustion engine.|$|E
25|$|According to the Gasification and <b>Syngas</b> Technologies Council, a trade association, {{there are}} {{globally}} 272operating gasification plants with 686gasifiers and 74plants with 238gasifiers under construction. Most of them use coal as feedstock.|$|E
25|$|Choren Industries {{has built}} a plant in Germany that {{converts}} biomass to <b>syngas</b> and fuels using the Shell Fischer–Tropsch process structure. The company went bankrupt in 2011 due to impracticalities in the process.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syngas</b> can be {{used for}} heat {{production}} and for generation of mechanical and electrical power. Like other gaseous fuels, producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels, leading to more efficient and cleaner operation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syngas</b> {{can be used}} {{to produce}} methanol, DME and hydrogen, or {{converted}} via the Fischer-Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700°C.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting <b>syngas</b> can be combusted. Alternatively, if the <b>syngas</b> is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of gasification is that using the <b>syngas</b> (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially {{more efficient than}} direct combustion of the original fuel {{because it can be}} combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. <b>Syngas</b> may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as biodegradable waste. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.|$|E
25|$|General Electric is {{currently}} designing an IGCC model plant that should introduce greater reliability. GE's model features advanced turbines optimized for the coal <b>syngas.</b> Eastman's industrial gasification plant in Kingsport, TN uses a GE Energy solid-fed gasifier. Eastman, a fortune 500 company, built the facility in 1983 without any {{state or federal}} subsidies and turns a profit.|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion CO2 removal is {{much easier}} than CO2 removal from flue gas in {{post-combustion}} capture due to the high concentration of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the <b>syngas.</b> During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in post-combustion flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred {{for the removal of}} CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents is the need for the <b>syngas</b> to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{chemical}} reactions of methane are combustion, steam reforming to <b>syngas,</b> and halogenation. In general, methane reactions {{are difficult to}} control. Partial oxidation to methanol, for example, is challenging because the reaction typically progresses {{all the way to}} carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen. The enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane, but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, coal-derived <b>syngas</b> can be {{converted}} into transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel through additional treatment via the Fischer-Tropsch process or into methanol which itself {{can be used as}} transportation fuel or fuel additive, or which can {{be converted}} into gasoline by the methanol to gasoline process. Methane from coal gasification {{can be converted}} into LNG for use as a fuel in the transport sector.|$|E
25|$|Mississippi Power’s Kemper Project is in late {{stages of}} construction. It {{will be a}} lignite-fuel IGCC plant, {{generating}} a net 524 MW of power from <b>syngas,</b> while capturing over 65% of CO2 generated using the Selexol process. The technology at the Kemper facility, Transport-Integrated Gasification (TRIG), was developed and is licensed by KBR. The CO2 will be sent by pipeline to depleted oil fields in Mississippi for enhanced oil recovery operations.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s {{production}} of gas from coal was an obsolete technology. By 1963 the Geelong Gas Company had changed production methods, using an Onia Gegi reforming plant to convert hydrocarbon gases from the Shell oil refinery at Corio into town gas. The new reforming plant was visited by many other gas companies {{as an example}} of modern <b>Syngas</b> technology. The former coal carbonising equipment was only used when coke (a by-product of the gasification process) was required.|$|E
25|$|Gasification of bio mass yields {{wood gas}} or <b>syngas</b> {{which can be}} {{converted}} into substitute natural gas by Methanation. Nearly 750 million tons of non edible (by cattle) biomass is available annually in India which can be put to higher value addition use and substitute imported crude oil, coal, LNG, urea fertiliser, nuclear fuels, etc. It is estimated that renewable and carbon neutral biomass resources of India can replace present consumption of all fossil fuels when used productively.|$|E
25|$|In small {{business}} and building applications, where the wood source is sustainable, 250–1000 kWe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in Europe that produce tar free <b>syngas</b> from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery. This type of plant {{is often referred to}} as a wood biomass CHP unit but is a plant with seven different processes: biomass processing, fuel delivery, gasification, gas cleaning, waste disposal, electricity generation and heat recovery.|$|E
25|$|Gasification is {{a process}} that {{converts}} organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (>700°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called <b>syngas</b> (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas {{is considered to be a}} source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.|$|E
25|$|Combustion of <b>syngas</b> or derived fuels emits {{exactly the}} same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct {{combustion}} of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could {{play a significant role in}} a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes {{the same amount of}} CO2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.|$|E
25|$|Currently Industrial-scale {{gasification}} {{is primarily}} {{used to produce}} electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the <b>syngas</b> is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially {{in the production of}} electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO2 capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.|$|E
