In this paper, an efficient numerical approach for field infrared <b>smoke</b> <b>transmittance</b> based on grayscale images is presented. Firstly, a field trial experimental setup is introduced. Then a grayscale <b>smoke</b> <b>transmittance</b> mathematical model is deduced and built. In addition, an image processing algorithm is used to extract the gray values of certain pixel points from grayscale images, and the positions of the selected points are discussed. Lastly, a field trial sample calculation is included to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method. The results prove to be of enough precision for engineering applications, and the method has greatly simplified the field trial process, thus improving efficiency...|$|E
