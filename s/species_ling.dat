The iChip is a small plastic block that contains 192 holes going through it. The holes are filled with a culture medium that are then inoculated with soil diluted to deposit only one bacterium in each hole. After depositing the bacterium in the holes the iChip is covered on both sides by a semipermeable membrane and put into a box of the original soil. The permeable membranes allow nutrients and growth factors from the soil to diffuse in and allow growth of only one <b>species.</b> <b>Ling</b> et al. screened approximately 10,000 iChip growth isolates for prospective antimicrobial activity, and E. terrae seemed to be hopeful.

In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the <b>species,</b> <b>ling</b> and tusk, in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of ling and tusk otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only. In order to achieve precise and stable age determination, {{there is a need for}} inter-calibrations of readings by different readers, and repeated reading by the same reader...|$|E

Ascertaining the severity of this threat to particular amphibian species is necessary if managers are to prioritize conservation actions. In New Zealand, Bd has been detected on both threatened endemic (Leiopelma spp.) and widespread introduced (Litoria spp.) anuran <b>species,</b> but <b>Le.</b> archeyi, one of four native species, has demonstrated low susceptibility to chytridiomycosis in captivity. To determine potential impacts of Bd on New Zealand's native anuran fauna, we assessed the susceptibility of two native <b>species,</b> <b>Le.</b> pakeka and Le. hochstetteri, to chytridiomycosis. We exposed Bd-naive individuals to a virulent New Zealand isolate of Bd, and monitored infection status with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Furthermore, no frogs demonstrated clinical signs of chytridiomycosis. Since Le. archeyi has similarly demonstrated low susceptibility, this appears to be a genus-wide trend, which warrants further study of the mechanism of this response. These findings, in agreement with results from field surveys and analyses of skin peptide defenses, suggest that Bd poses a low risk to leiopelmatids. An investigative study of potential susceptibility to Bd, such as this one, can better equip managers to target imminent threats and focus conservation plans for at-risk amphibian fauna...|$|R

40|$|Dispersal {{ability and}} {{reproductive}} success are important criteria {{in determining whether}} a threatened or endangered species is capable of recovering from bottlenecks and catastrophic population declines. The goal of this dissertation is to understand patterns of population genetic variation and population connectivity (i. e. gene flow), and their implications {{for the conservation of}} freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae). I generated mitochondrial DNA sequence data and nuclear microsatellite data sets for five mussel <b>species</b> (Leptodea leptodon, <b>Le.</b> fragilis, Lampsilis abrupta, Cyprogenia aberti, C. stegaria) and one fish species (Aplodinotus grunniens) in order to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure within each of these species. In the first of three chapters, I assessed the genetic variation of two nominal species in the genus Cyprogenia (C. aberti and C. stegaria) in order to delineate the number of evolutionary lineages present within the genus. Based on the molecular data collected from mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite genotyping, I found evidence of mito-nuclear discordance in Cyprogenia. Analyses of mtDNA sequences suggest that two deeply divergent clades co-occur sympatrically in most of our sampling sites; the nuclear microsatellite data support three allopatric clades that correspond to major hydrologic basins. My study also showed that the pigmentation of mussel conglutinates in Cyprogenia is highly correlated with the recovered mtDNA clades. Furthermore, the mtDNA sequences appear to be under selection and therefore not reliable for delineating species, and the recognition of species and evolutionarily significant units was based solely on the microsatellite data. The second chapter investigates the impact of host fish dispersal on the gene flow of a common and a rare mussel species. I compared the gene flow pattern and population structure of an endangered mussel species Leptodea leptodon and its common and widespread congener Le. fragilis with their shared host fish, the freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens. The results showed that population structure of Le. fragilis were more congruent with that of the host fish, while the endangered Le. leptodon populations displayed higher levels of genetic isolation among drainages. In the third chapter I investigated contributions to mussel gene flow from two sources: gamete-mediated gene flow contributed through sperm dispersal, and zygote-mediated gene flow contributed through larval (glochidia) dispersal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether sperm dispersal or glochidia dispersal (via host fish) contribute more to maintaining connectivity among mussel populations. I developed an approach for estimating sperm gene flow of mussel populations when a paternally inherited genetic marker is not available. This is the first study that attempts to measure the gamete-mediated gene flow (male gene flow) in mollusks using mtDNA and nuclear markers.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Concerned researchers have argued that winter region habitat losses may exacerbate observed declines of grassland birds on the breeding grounds. Yet few studies have investigated grassland bird habits during the non-breeding season. I examined how wintering habitat affinities and shifts in community organization among grassland birds are shaped by responses to summer fire and grazing management. Summer prescribed burns are thought to sustain remaining prairie parcels by deterring woody species succession and by restoring historical disturbance regimes presumed to favor tallgrass prairie plants. I identified woody community responses to summer prescribed burns. Summer fire had a greater impact on small shrubs than large shrubs or shrub cover. Data suggested that with appropriate rest periods, enough fine fuel can accumulate to sustain similarly hot summer burns among grazing contexts. I offer that a rest-rotational grazing regime provides managers operational flexibility to integrate prescribed burning and sustainable grazing pressures into their management plans. Despite often being grouped into a single guild, grassland species did not respond similarly to management disturbances. Species exhibited higher use according to specific ecological conditions within successional ecotypes. Data suggested that grassland birds responded to two patterns of prairie succession that occurred along different temporal landscapes. In the short term, grassland species responded to disturbance mediated herbaceous succession. But over the long term, if fire intervals lengthened and shrub communities progressed, then grassland bird habitat use declined in association with woody plant induced desuetude that threatens the traditional openness of tallgrass prairies. Indeed, the presence of several <b>species,</b> <b>Le</b> Conte's Sparrow, Sedge Wren, and Sprague's Pipit, rapidly declined in areas where shrub densities surpassed 100 ha- 1 and shrub cover exceeded 30 %. At Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, I examined wintering grassland bird habitat use separate from woody advancement in an ungrazed prairie ecosystem. Data demonstrated that following fire, species were preferentially occupying specific successional patches. I expect this general pattern was largely mediated by proximate responses to habitat structure as prairie plants recovered in subsequent growing seasons post-burn...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to oxygen, Escherichia coli increases {{the expression of}} enzymes essential for aerobic respiration, such as components of the TCA cycle and terminal oxidase complexes. This increase requires the elimination of repression mediated by the Arc regulatory system under anaerobic conditions. Coordinately, the synthesis of enzymes that function in anaerobic processes such as fermentation decreases, {{partly due to the}} inactiva-tion of the transcription factor Fnr. E. coli is thus able to adjust the levels of respiratory enzymes to fit its environmental circumstances, and in this case, reduces the production of the less energy efficient fermentation enzymes in favor of the aerobic pathways.

Composition of the weed community and abundance of individual species were measured in. September and in. November just before crop harvest. In September there were very litde differences between treatinents, and in November the most important differences were due to time of gap opening but not between gaps {{of different}}: sizes. Most weed species are synchronous with the crop and are well adapted to coexist with it, {{so there is a}} marked negative effect of late opening of gaps on most of them.

5000|$|The {{primates}} called [...] "apes" [...] today {{became known}} to Europeans after the 18th century. As zoological knowledge developed, {{it became clear}} that taillessness occurred {{in a number of different}} and otherwise distantly related <b>species.</b> Sir Wilfrid <b>Le</b> Gros Clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an [...] ".. ascending series", leading from [...] "monkeys" [...] to [...] "apes" [...] to humans. Within this tradition [...] "ape" [...] came to refer to all members of the superfamily Hominoidea except humans. As such, this use of [...] "apes" [...] represented a paraphyletic grouping, meaning that, even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor, this grouping did not include all the descendant species, because humans were excluded from being among the apes.|$|R
40|$|Mountains {{are one of}} the {{conspicuous}} topographic {{features of}} the Hawaiian Islands. Because of these features, altitude-associated factors are of great importance to the island ecosystem. The present study is concerned with endemic psyllids in the Metrosideros collina polymorpha var. incana ecosystem in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the slopes of Mauna Loa. Psyllids, Homoptera: Psyllidae, {{are one of the}} major groups of primary consumers in Metrosideros ecosystem. The adults, Fig. la, are small fragile insects, approximately 2 - 4 mm in length. The eggs, Fig. Id, are laid on terminal shoots either on old growth or young shoot. They are 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm in length, yellow or black depending on species, and laid with one end partially imbedded in the host tissue. Upon hatching, the nymphs of most <b>species,</b> Fig. <b>le,</b> produce galls of various shapes depending upon the species, Figs. 1 and 2. They develop within the galls, emerge from them when fully grown, and molt into adults outside of the galls. In certain areas extensive damage resulting from deformation of terminal leaves and stems, was observed. Fig. 1.

Cedar seeds were sown on reference and local soils isolated from surrounding soil, on nonisolated local soil, and on forest floor with moss removed. Western hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar seeded on forest floor acted as controls. Treatments were {{implemented in the}} HA interior and the HA–clearcut edge, with soil treatments also imple-mented in clearcuts. Germinants and very young seedlings of cedar have a low leaf area of needle-like primary foliage. Cedar development of secondary foliage (the scale foliage normally associated with this species) was correlated with greater vigour and growth. Secondary foliage developed in the rankings forest edge and clearcut> forest interior, and reference isolated soil> local isolated soil> nonisolated local soil. Seedling survival rankings were edge> interior, and amabilis fir> hemlock> cedar on soil and with moss removed> cedar on forest floor. Cedar and amabilis fir showed a smaller growth response to light than hemlock. The results indicate that cedar, normally considered a late successional species, needs disturbance for early seedling establishment and survival and thus has some characteristics of an early seral <b>species.</b> Résumé: <b>Les</b> semis de thuya (Thuja plicata Donn ex D.

40|$|Although the {{structure}} of the ovipositor of parasitic Hymenoptera is largely uniform, interspecific variation in its morphology can be observed. Such variability {{may be related to the}} diversity of hosts attacked. To verify such an hypothesis, we compared, using correspondence analysis, the morphological characteristics of the ovipositors of 20 species in three categories: (i) species belonging to the same taxonomic unit and attacking the same type of host, (ii) species belonging to the same taxonomic unit but attacking different types of host, and (iii) species belonging to different taxonomic units but attacking the same type of host. Results show that variability in some morphological traits of the ovipositor can be related to host characteristics. Adaptive convergence in morphological variations observed between <b>species</b> is discussed. <b>Le</b> Ralec, A., J. M. Rabasse et E. Wajnberg. 1996.

40|$|Abstract: The {{striped bass}} (Morone saxatilis) is an {{economically}} and ecologically valuable finfish species that inhabits nearshore and estuarine waters of many states along the US Atlantic coast. Chesapeake Bay provides extensive nursery and foraging habitats for striped bass, yet {{fish in the}} bay exhibit high prevalence of disease caused by bacteria in the genus My-cobacterium. Detection of population-level impacts associated with mycobacteriosis has been difficult because the disease is chronic and synoptic biological and disease data have been limited. Here, we present modeling analyses of growth data for disease-positive and-negative striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. Three growth relationships were considered, and for each, a single model was parameterized to include several covariates, most notably disease status and severity. Our results indicate that disease-positive and-negative fish have differing growth patterns and that the estimated asymptotic sizes of disease-positive fish are considerably {{lower than those of}} disease-negative fish. Compromised growth along with documentation that striped bass in Chesapeake Bay are experiencing disease-associated mortality suggests that disease may be reducing the pro-ductivity of this <b>species.</b> Résumé: <b>Le</b> bar rayé (Morone saxatilis) est un poisson téléostéen de grande importance économique et écologique qui ha-bite les eaux côtières et estuariennes de plusieurs états de la côte atlantique des É. -U.
