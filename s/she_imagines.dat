60|$|And {{all around}} was this cradle of snow, {{and there was}} firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles.

She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E
5|$|In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, Ahalya is {{depicted}} as a romantic adulteress. When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she {{falls in love with}} Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya's marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying {{that it is not the}} right day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E
25|$|Babydoll convinces {{the four}} girls {{to join her}} in {{preparing}} an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by steampunk-inspired World War I German soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea copying {{a map of the}} brothel/institution from Blue's office); storming an Orc-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by Amber stealing a lighter from the mayor's pocket); and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by Sweet Pea stealing a kitchen knife from the Cook's belt). During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to save Sweet Pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket while she tries to protect her sister.|$|E

25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written at the ocean's point of view, {{detailing}} the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to [...] "Mother Oceania" [...] {{from which the}} singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: [...] "You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore [...] ". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{important}} questions raised by the novel is whether Maria is deluded in her relationship with Darnford. Maria writes an autobiography for her daughter in which she admits that she was misled by Venables, but critics disagree over {{the extent to which}} she is also misled by Darnford. Some suggest that Maria repeats her mistake and imagines Darnford as a hero, citing as evidence Maria's refusal to leave the madhouse, when she is free to do so, because she wants to remain with him, as well as her infatuation with Rousseau's novel Julie, or the New Heloise. <b>She</b> <b>imagines</b> Darnford as its [...] "hero", St. Preux, the sometime lover but not husband of Julie. [...] Maria's reading and the plots she conjures in her imagination {{as a result of that}} reading are the cause of her downfall in this interpretation: unable or unwilling to separate fiction from reality, she incorporates Darnford into her romantic fantasies. Other critics, while agreeing that Maria is led astray by Darnford, argue that it is not her sexuality and eroticism that are the problem, but her choice of partner. They argue that Wollstonecraft is not portraying female sexuality as inherently detrimental, as she had in Mary and the Rights of Woman, rather she is criticizing the directions it often takes.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} {{motherhood}} is also explored in the episode. According to Elyce Rae Helford, {{in her book}} Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, Mrs. Peacock functions as a being who has been reduced [...] "to all female functions" [...] by her sons. [...] She is [...] "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" [...] other than {{to do anything for}} her children. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club writes that [...] "Scully’s sympathy for a mother that <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> to be persecuted is turned violently on its head, to reveal a monster whose priorities are not quite so straightforward." [...] The episode {{is also one of the}} first to explore Scully's desire to become a mother. Booker states that the episode presents the dual nature of Scully's [...] "modern desire for motherhood", as opposed to Mrs. Peacock's [...] "perverted notion of family". Helford writes that the entry predicts [...] "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she is a mother, albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in second season, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result. With the revelation that Scully is pregnant at the end of the seventh season finale, [...] "Requiem", the concept revolving around Scully as a mother took center stage in seasons eight and nine with the birth of baby William.|$|E

Although house-elves can become intoxicated on Butterbeer, the amount of alcohol contained in Butterbeer has a negligible effect on Witches and Wizards. J.K.

Butterbeer can be served cold or hot, but either way it has a warming effect.|$|E

The work follows Maureen and Bamford Smales, an educated white couple, hiding for their lives with July, their long-time former servant. The novel plays off the various groups of [...] "July's people": {{his family and his}} village, as well as the Smales. The story examines how people cope with the terrible choices forced on them by violence, race hatred, and the state.|$|E
2500|$|Octavius goes to Cleopatra {{trying to}} persuade her to surrender.

2500|$|Mason's {{response}} {{was viewed as}} especially critical of Nancy Grace, whose news program is cited as having [...] "almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession". Grace said {{that she did not}} understand why Mason would care what pundits are saying, and that <b>she</b> <b>imagines</b> she has tried and covered as many cases as Mason. She criticized the defense attorneys for delivering media criticism before mentioning Caylee's name in their post-verdict news conference, and said she disagrees with the verdict. At a meeting of local professionals, named the Tiger Bay Club of Tampa, Mason told the media and those in attendance that he was surprised by the not-guilty verdict.|$|E
