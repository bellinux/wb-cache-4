40|$|Actions {{are said}} to be 'willed' if we {{consciously}} pay attention to their selection. It has been suggested that they are associated with activations in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (area 46). However, because previous experiments typically used a 'free selection' paradigm to examine this hypothesis, it is unclear whether the results reflected the attention to the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> or the freedom of choice allowed by the tasks. In this experiment, we minimized the difference of working memory demand across task conditions by using novel stimuli in each trial. We found that activation in the dorsal prefrontal cortex on a free selection task was not significantly different from that induced by another task that required attention to the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> although the responses were externally specified. This suggests that the dorsal prefrontal cortex is in fact associated with attention to the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> but does not play a unique role in the generation <b>of</b> internally initiated <b>actions.</b> However, the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) may subserve this function as activity in this region was found to be tightly associated with the free <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> responses.

50|$|The role of frontostriatal {{circuits}} is {{not well}} understood. Two of the common theories are action selection and reinforcement learning. The action selection hypothesis suggest that frontalcortex generates possible actions and the striatum selects one of these actions by inhibiting the execution of other actions while allowing the selected action execution. Whereas, the reinforcement learning hypothesis suggest that prediction errors are used to update future reward expectations for selected actions and this guides the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> based on reward expectations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe address {{decentralized}} stochastic control problems {{represented as}} decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). This formalism provides a general model for decision-making under uncertainty in cooperative, decentralized settings, but the worst-case complexity {{makes it difficult}} to solve optimally (NEXP-complete). Recent advances suggest recasting Dec-POMDPs into continuous-state and deterministic MDPs. In this form, however, states and actions are embedded into high-dimensional spaces, making accurate estimate of states and greedy <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> intractable for all but trivial-sized problems. The primary contribution of this paper is the first framework for error-monitoring during approximate estimation of states and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> Such a framework permits us to convert state-of-the-art exact methods into error-bounded algorithms, which results in a scalability increase as demonstrated by experiments over problems of unprecedented sizes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDescribing {{cognition}} as cooperating learning mechanisms [1] is {{a fruitful}} {{way to approach}} its complexity and its dynamics. In a simple model, we explore a possible cooperation between a long lasting procedural memory and a dynamical reinforcement learning, supposed to be respectively located in the parietal cortex and in the basal ganglia. In [2], the authors describe the visual system not only as perceiving features but also as preparing appropriate motor outputs elicited by perceived features. They state that this association is built in the parietal cortex. The <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is one <b>of</b> the goals of reinforcement learning [3] and aims at triggering the action that maximizes the expectation of reward. The basal ganglia have been proposed as a substratum for this selection [4]. Few models of the basal ganglia consider that the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> could operate on a restricted set <b>of</b> pre-activated <b>actions.</b> We have recently incorporated in the RDDR model (Reinforcement Driven Dimensionality Reduction [5]) realistic physiological and behavioral characteristics, including neuronal formalism of computation, protocol of learning and cerebral information flows. Concerning the latter characteristic, the network is composed of a sensorimotor cortical axis and a basal loop, intersecting in a cortical motor area. The cortical flow {{is the result of}} a perceptive analysis in a visual area and an associative matching in a parietal area. This results in the pre-activation <b>of</b> possible <b>actions</b> in the motor area. The basal loop integrates the cortical information in the input structure, the striatum, and compresses it in the output structure (GPi/SNr) where a strong reduction of dimensionality takes place. The <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is made at this level, thanks to the modulatory effect of the reward. The resulting effect is sent back to the motor area. The parietal pre-activation of the motor area is not sufficient to trigger an action but is sufficient to activate the striatum and to make selection operate on a restricted set <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> It will consequently speed up the convergence of reinforcement learning. As often required in reinforcement learning, an exploration mechanism is added to compensate the only exploitation of current knowledge and allows sometimes to trigger an action never associated before and thus to discover new rewarding rules. This new perception-action association, if validated by delivery of reward, will also modify the associative learning in the cortex. An interplay between two systems of memory is consequently observed: a procedural memory limits the choices for the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> by reinforcement learning and is in turn fed by the results <b>of</b> that <b>selection,</b> made by exploitation and exploration...|$|R

40|$|Whenever we plan, imagine, or observe an action, {{the motor}} systems {{that would be}} {{involved}} in preparing and executing that action are similarly engaged. The way in which such common motor activation is formed, however, is likely to differ depending on whether it arises from our own intentional <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> or from the observation of another 2 ̆ 7 s action. In this study, we use time-resolved event-related functional MRI to tease apart neural processes specifically related to the processing <b>of</b> observed <b>actions,</b> the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> our own intended actions, the preparation for movement, and motor response execution. Participants observed a finger gesture movement or a cue indicating they should select their own finger gesture to perform, followed by a 5 -s delay period; participants then performed the observed or self-selected action. During the preparation and readiness for action, prior to initiation, we found activation in a common network of higher motor areas, including dorsal and ventral premotor areas and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA); the more caudal SMA showed greater activation during movement execution. Importantly, the route to this common motor activation differed depending on whether participants freely selected the actions to perform or whether they observed the actions performed by another person. Observation <b>of</b> <b>action</b> specifically involved activation of inferior and superior parietal regions, reflecting involvement of the dorsal visual pathway in visuomotor processing required for planning the action. In contrast, the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> specifically involved the dorsal lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting the role of these prefrontal areas in attentional selection and guiding the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> responses.
