5|$|Scotland {{also has}} {{numerous}} vitrified forts but again an accurate chronology {{has proven to}} be evasive. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, using a variety of techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.|$|E
25|$|Only one work is {{attributed}} with certainty to Alamire, a four-part instrumental piece Tandernaken op den Rijn; however his evident skill and {{experience as a}} composer <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the anonymous works of the time may be his.|$|E
25|$|All Heliamphora {{species are}} endemic to the tepuis of the Guiana Highlands and their {{surrounding}} uplands. Most {{are found in}} Venezuela, with a few extending into western Guyana and northern Brazil. Many of the tepuis {{have not yet been}} explored for Heliamphora, and the large number of species described in recent years <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> more species may be awaiting discovery.|$|E

25|$|Great Dodd {{may also}} be {{included}} in a circular walk around Deepdale known as The Dodds. Or it may {{be included in a}} ridge walk, along the main Helvellyn ridge. The ridge path in either direction is broad and clear, with a shortcut contouring to the west of Great Dodd's summit which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> ridge walkers bypass the summit.|$|E
25|$|The oldest archaeological {{evidence}} for domesticated horses is from Kazakhstan and Ukraine between 6000 and 5500 years BP. The diverse mitochondrial DNA {{of the domestic}} horse coinciding with the very low diversity on the Y chromosome <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> mares but only very few stallions were used, and local use of wild mares or even secondary sites of domestication are likely. Therefore, the European tarpan {{may have contributed to}} the domestic horse.|$|E
25|$|In the runoff, Fujimori {{won with}} 51.1% {{of the total}} votes. While votes for Toledo {{declined}} from 37.0% of the total votes cast {{in the first round}} to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round. The large percentage of invalid votes in this election <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Peruvians took Toledo's advice and spoiled their ballots.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent report}} on the Sava river in Serbia <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the river silts contain about 100Bqkg1 of natural radioisotopes (226Ra, 232Th, and 238U). According to the United Nations the normal {{concentration}} of uranium in soil ranges between 300μgkg1 and 11.7mgkg1. It {{is well known that}} some plants, called hyperaccumulators, are able to absorb and concentrate metals within their tissues; iodine was first isolated from seaweed in France, which suggests that seaweed is an iodine hyperaccumulator.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to {{a handful}} of wealthy sympathisers, the sale of {{debentures}} was more successful but the identity of some of the debenture holders <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of these were donations rather than true investments. The first 20 debentures were bought by Edward Martyn, president of Sinn Féin from 1905 to 1908 and patron of many of Griffith's enterprises. John Sweetman, second president of Sinn Féin bought debentures 21 to 70, and the third most important investor, holder of 50 debentures, was Roger Casement, also a patron of many nationalist organisations until his execution {{in the aftermath of the}} 1916 Rising.|$|E
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Domesday Book is that {{by this time the}} native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, particularly Harold Godwinson himself. However, the Bodmin manumissions show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names. Naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans and further proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as Beroul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{variants}} {{contributing to a}} disease and the interactions among those variants also could influence the distribution of diseases among groups. The difficulty that has been encountered in finding contributory alleles for complex diseases and in replicating positive associations <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> complex diseases involve numerous variants rather than a moderate number of alleles, {{and the influence of}} any given variant may depend in critical ways on the genetic and environmental background. If many alleles are required to increase susceptibility to a disease, the odds are low that the necessary combination of alleles would become concentrated in a particular group purely through drift.|$|E
25|$|Layered {{sedimentary}} deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably {{consist of}} both sedimentary rock and poorly indurated or unconsolidated sediments. Thick sedimentary deposits {{occur in the}} interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and Meridiani Planum (see Henry Crater for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., Vastitas Borealis Formation). The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in an area containing cross-bedded (mainly eolian) sandstones (Burns formation). Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in Eberswalde Crater and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments.|$|E
25|$|Motivations {{direct and}} {{energize}} behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began {{a line of}} research which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> emotions are universal. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.|$|E
50|$|Facultative bipedality is {{most common}} in lizards, but also occurs in primates, bears, insects, crabs and even octopuses. It is {{commonly}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> extinct basal archosaurs were facultative bipeds, as well as hadrosaurs.|$|R

25|$|The Patrick {{portrayed by}} Tírechán and Muirchu is a martial figure, who {{contests}} with druids, overthrows pagan idols, and curses kings and kingdoms. On occasion, their accounts contradict Patrick's own writings: Tírechán states that Patrick accepted gifts from female converts although Patrick himself flatly denies this. However, the emphasis Tírechán and Muirchu placed on female converts, {{and in particular}} royal and noble women who became nuns, {{is thought to be}} a genuine insight into Patrick's work of conversion. Patrick also worked with the unfree and the poor, encouraging them to vows of monastic chastity. Tírechán's account <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> early Patrician churches were combined with nunneries founded by Patrick's noble female converts.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Little Bighorn, half of the 7th Cavalry's {{companies}} had just returned from 18 months of constabulary duty in the Deep South, having been recalled to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reassemble the regiment for the campaign. About 20 percent of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained, and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from Ireland, England and Germany, just as many of the veteran troopers had been before their enlistments. Archaeological evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of these troopers were malnourished and in poor physical condition, despite being the best-equipped and supplied regiment in the Army.|$|E
25|$|Distinct {{characteristics}} of urban planning from {{remains of the}} cities of Harappa, Lothal, Dholavira, and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilisation (in modern-day northwestern India and Pakistan) lead archeologists to interpret them as the earliest known examples of deliberately planned and managed cities. The streets {{of many of these}} early cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern, with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys. Archaeological evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy; many also had their own water wells, probably both for sanitary and for ritual purposes. These ancient cities were unique in that they often had drainage systems, seemingly tied to a well-developed ideal of urban sanitation. Cities laid out on the grid plan could have been an outgrowth of agriculture based on rectangular fields.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence of healing {{of the bones}} of the skull in prehistoric skeletons, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of those <b>that</b> proceeded with the surgery survived their operation. In some studies, the rate of survival surpassed 50%.|$|R

This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> C. dubliniensis has {{probably}} been present in the community for a much longer period than its recent discovery indicates and could also <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> cases of C. dubliniensis endophthalmitis have been wrongly attributed to C. albicans in previous published literature.|$|R
50|$|Historians such as Edward Radzinsky <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> pogroms were incited by authorities, {{even if some}} {{happened}} spontaneously, {{supported by}} the Tsarist Russian secret police (the Okhrana). Those perpetrators who were prosecuted usually received clemency by Tsar's decree.|$|R
25|$|Mosasaurs had a {{body shape}} {{similar to those}} of modern-day monitor lizards (varanids), but were more {{elongated}} and streamlined for swimming. Their limb bones were reduced in length and their paddles were formed by webbing between their long finger and toe bones. Their tails were broad, and supplied their locomotive power. Until recently, mosasaurs were assumed to have swum in a method similar to the one used today by conger eels and sea snakes, undulating their entire bodies from side to side. However, new evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> advanced mosasaurs had large, crescent-shaped flukes on the ends of their tails, {{similar to those of}} sharks and some ichthyosaurs. Rather than use snake-like undulations, their bodies probably remained stiff to reduce drag through the water, while their tails provided strong propulsion. These animals may have lurked and pounced rapidly and powerfully on passing prey, rather than chasing after it.|$|E
25|$|Led by the {{minister}} of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1200 members in Orange County, California. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired known city employees who were Catholic {{and replaced them with}} Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.|$|E
500|$|Anne also {{commissioned}} {{artists such}} as Paul van Somer, Isaac Oliver, and Daniel Mytens, who led English taste in visual arts for a generation. Under Anne, the Royal Collection began once more to expand, a policy continued by Anne's son, Charles. Historian Alan Stewart <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the phenomena now seen as peculiarly Jacobean can be identified more closely with Anne's patronage than with James, who [...] "fell asleep during some of England's most celebrated plays".|$|E
