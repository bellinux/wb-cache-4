40|$|Prefabrication and {{modularization}} {{has been}} used in the construction industry for decades. It has recently made a resurgence worldwide providing increased productivity, safety, quality and construction schedule. This research has focused on the situation where a construction company has decided to use prefabrication and faces two possibilities, they either will <b>self-perform</b> or they will outsource the construction of the prefabricated components. The decision making process used by a construction company to determine whether to outsource or <b>self-perform</b> prefabricated components is examined and analyzed. ^ Prefabrication is an industrial process in which certain components are manufactured in a specialized facility. These items will then be assembled or installed on the construction site in their final position. Any component manufactured off-site and requires being assembled or installed to form a complete system can be considered as prefabricated. ^ Outsourcing is a strategy in which a company hires another to perform some of their work activities. In the construction industry, outsourcing is performed by highly specialized companies, typically subcontractors or suppliers. In prefabrication outsourcing refers to subcontracting another company to perform 2 ̆ 2 manufacturing 2 ̆ 2 of prefabricated components offsite with their own resources. ^ <b>Self-performing</b> refers to a company executing activities of a project by utilizing their own qualified labor, specific types of equipment, and have specialized knowledge on how to construct the components. In construction, <b>self-performing</b> is typically used for schedule sensitive, complex and critical activities. This allows the contractors to identify and solve construction issues, control the level of quality, and manage the safety processes. Contractors <b>self-performing</b> have advantage over those that do not because of these issues. When referring to <b>self-performing</b> or prefabrication, it means that a contractor would be in charge of setting up the off-site manufacturing facility and providing prefabricated components that will be assembled or installed in the project. ^ In order to provide guidelines for construction companies to decide between outsourcing prefabricated components (buying/outsourcing) or creating a new division dedicated to manufacturing the components (making/self-performing) a decision tool was developed. The most important reasons for outsourcing and the most important reasons for <b>self-performing</b> were identified in a survey. Using all the information as a base, a survey tool was developed, tested and forwarded to experts to fill. The results of the survey were processed and analyzed {{in order to create a}} decision making tool to assist construction companies in their decision to whether outsource or <b>self-perform</b> prefabricated components. The tool is focused on construction companies who have had some experience with prefabrication in the past and are currently trying to decide if they should open a prefabrication facility to <b>self-perform</b> their own prefabricated components or if they should outsource them. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is {{a leading}} cause of {{neonatal}} morbidity and mortality. In an effort to reduce the impact of this serious affliction, universal screening for GBS has been adopted in many countries. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the acceptability of self-collected GBS swabs in a local population in Hong Kong. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital. A total of 327 pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinic for GBS screening from April 2012 to May 2012 were included in our study. The acceptability of GBS self-screening and its associated factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of these women, 200 / 320 (62. 5 %) participants preferred screening by healthcare workers, whereas only 18 / 320 (5. 6 %) preferred self-screening. The most common reasons why some participants preferred to be screened by clinicians were that professionals had greater knowledge, and the added worry about the accuracy of self-screening. 22 / 320 (69. 4 %) and 195 / 320 (60. 9 %) women believed that they felt comfortable enough to <b>self-perform</b> the vaginal swab and rectal swab respectively. Previous use of tampons was associated with higher perceived capability of <b>self-performing</b> the vaginal swab. Perceived capability to <b>self-perform</b> the rectovaginal swabs was associated with a willingness to <b>self-perform</b> the swabs (p < 0. 001). The majority of women, 303 / 320 (94. 7 %), found the current practice of an additional clinic visit for GBS screening acceptable. However, 218 / 320 (68. 1 %) participants would like to undertake self-screening if they were given the chance to do so in the next pregnancy, and 187 / 320 (58. 4 %) would recommend others have self-screening for GBS as well. CONCLUSION: Most women in the local population still preferred physician-collected samples for GBS screening, but they welcomed the option of self-screening in future pregnancies. Improved health education about the importance of GBS screening may improve the willingness of women to perform self-screening. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the first phase of a long-term study that addresses the determinants of the production arrangements by US building (commercial and residential construction) and non-building contractors (transportation, environmental and industrial construction). Empirical and census data are used to understand the subcontracting and self-performance practice of the considered contractors. The significant differences in their production arrangements are explained in terms of range of technological requirements and their relative importance within undertaken projects. Building contractors tend to subcontract much of their production, because of the relatively wider range of technological inputs of building projects and liability concerns. On the contrary, non-building contractors <b>self-perform</b> much of their production, because of the relatively narrower range of technological inputs of their projects and higher fixed investments in dedicated assets.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of optimal QoS Traffic Engineering (TE) in Co-Channel Interference (CCI) -affected {{power-limited}} wireless access networks that support connectionless services. By exploiting the analytical tool offered by nonlinear optimization and following the emerging "Decomposition as Optimization" paradigm [1], the approach pursued in this paper allows to develop a resource allocation algorithm that is distributed, asynchronous, scalable and self-adaptive. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm enables each node of the network to distribute its outgoing traffic among all feasible next-hops in an optimal way, as measured by an assigned global cost function of general form. This optimal traffic distribution complies with several subjective as well as objective QoS requirements advanced by the supported media flows and involves only minimum information exchange between neighboring nodes. Furthermore, it allows for load-balanced multiple forwarding paths and it is able to <b>self-perform</b> optimal traffic re-distribution (i. e., re-routing) in the case of failure of the underlying wireless links. Finally, actual effectiveness of the overall proposed algorithm is numerically tested via performance comparisons against both DSDV-based single-path routing algorithms and interference-aware multipath routing algorithms. © 2011 Elsevier B.
