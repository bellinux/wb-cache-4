5|$|Antoni Gaudi {{was born}} in 1852 in Riudoms or Reus, to the {{coppersmith}} Francesc Gaudí i Serra (1813–1906) and Antònia Cornet i Bertran (1819–1876). He {{was the youngest of}} five children, of whom three <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> adulthood: Rosa (1844–1879), Francesc (1851–1876) and Antoni. Gaudí's family originated in the Auvergne region in southern France.

The family was Lutheran. He had two half-siblings (Else and Walter Bormann) from his father's earlier {{marriage}} to Louise Grobler, who died in 1898. Antonie Bormann gave birth to three sons, one of whom died in infancy. Martin (born 1900) and Albert (born 1902) <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> adulthood.

5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E

The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E

Some reports claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but according to survivors' accounts, the ship sank after 40 minutes of flooding.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average length of the femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E

5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings <b>survived</b> <b>to</b> fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators.
