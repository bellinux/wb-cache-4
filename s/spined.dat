5|$|Tall <b>spined</b> {{vertebrae}} {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of England were once {{considered to be}} {{very similar to those}} of Acrocanthosaurus, and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, A. altispinax. These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax.|$|E
5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often <b>spined</b> for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E
40|$|Many {{stingray}} species replace their poisonous caudal <b>spines</b> season- ally; however, it is {{hypothesized that}} <b>spine</b> replacement {{may also be}} induced through a traumatic injury to the caudal <b>spine.</b> To determine whether the round stingray, Urobatis halleri, can replace damaged <b>spines</b> outside of normal <b>spine</b> shedding season, secondary <b>spine</b> growth of stingrays with clipped, removed, and intact primary <b>spines</b> was compared. Additional rays were separately collected for histological analysis of <b>spine</b> development. Though initial results indicated no difference in <b>spine</b> initiation among the treatments, later <b>spine</b> removals showed the ability of U. halleri to replace lost <b>spines...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{structures}} of <b>spine</b> apparatuses differ {{depending on their}} elaboration and position in the <b>spine.</b> <b>Spines</b> can be classified into four different categories: thin, stubby, mushroom, and branched. The shape of the <b>spine</b> apparatus differs depending upon which <b>spine</b> type it is associated with. For example, when the <b>spine</b> apparatus is associated with thin <b>spines,</b> the morphology is simple and consists of a very basic tubular form; however, when the <b>spine</b> apparatus is associated with mushroom shaped dendritic <b>spines,</b> the morphology is a complex laminar arrangement of saccules in the <b>spine</b> head and stalk.|$|R

25|$|The {{various species}} of Pachypodium {{are more or}} less heavily <b>spined.</b> Species from more arid regions have evolved denser and longer spines.

25|$|Although a {{wide range}} of {{reproductive}} modes are used by snakes, all snakes employ internal fertilization. This is accomplished by means of paired, forked hemipenes, which are stored, inverted, in the male's tail.

40|$|Introduction: Degenerative <b>spine</b> {{disorders}} are steadily increasing {{parallel to the}} aging of the population with considerable impact on cost and productivity. In this paper we study the prevalence and risk factors for multiple <b>spine</b> surgery and its impact on cost. Methods: Data on 1, 153 <b>spine</b> surgery inpatients operated between October 2005 and September 2008 (index <b>spine</b> surgery) in regard to the number of previous <b>spine</b> surgeries and location of surgeries (cervical or lumbar) were retrospectively collected. Additionally, prospective follow-up over a period of 2 - 5 years was conducted. Results: Retrospectively, 365 (31. 7 %) patients were recurrent <b>spine</b> surgery patients while 788 (68. 3 %) were de novo <b>spine</b> surgery patients. Nearly half of those with previous <b>spine</b> surgery (51. 5 %) were on different regions of the <b>spine.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} length of stay or hospital charges except in lumbar decompression and fusion (LDF) patients with multiple interventions on the same region of the <b>spine.</b> Significant differences (P<. 05) in length of stay (5. 4 days vs. 7. 4 days) and hospital charges ($ 55, 477 vs. $ 74, 878) between LDF patients with one previous <b>spine</b> versus those with ≥ 3 previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same region were noted. Prospectively, the overall reoperation rate was 10. 4 %. The risk of additional <b>spine</b> surgery increased from 8. 0 % in patients with one previous <b>spine</b> surgery (index surgery) to 25. 6 % in patients with ≥ 4 previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on different regions of the <b>spine</b> (including index surgery). After excluding patients with previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on different regions of the <b>spine,</b> 17. 2 % of reoperated patients had additional <b>spine</b> surgery on a different <b>spine</b> region. The percentage of additional <b>spine</b> surgery on a distant <b>spine</b> region increased from 14. 0 % in patients with one <b>spine</b> surgery to 33. 0 % in patients with two <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same region. However, in patients with three or more <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same <b>spine</b> region there were no interventions on a distant <b>spine</b> region during the follow-up period. Conclusion: De novo <b>spine</b> surgery is associated with an increased incidence of additional <b>spine</b> surgery at the same or distant <b>spine</b> regions. Large prospective studies with extended follow-up periods and multifaceted cost-outcome analysis are needed to refine the appropriateness of <b>spine</b> surgery...|$|R

40|$|Synapses are the {{building}} blocks of neuronal networks. <b>Spines,</b> the postsynaptic elements, are morphologically the most plastic part of the synapse. It is thought that <b>spine</b> plasticity underlies learning and memory processes, driven by kinases and cytoskeleton protein reorganization. <b>Spine</b> strength depends primarily on the number of incorporated glutamatergic receptors, which are more numerous in larger <b>spines.</b> Intrinsic and circadian fluctuations, occurring independently of presynaptic stimulation, demonstrate the native instability of <b>spines.</b> Despite innate <b>spine</b> instability some <b>spines</b> remain intact lifelong. Threats to <b>spine</b> survival are reduced by physical and mental activity, and declining sensory input, conditions characteristic for aging. Large <b>spines</b> are considered less vulnerable than thin <b>spines,</b> and in the older brain large <b>spines</b> are more abundant, whereas the thin <b>spines</b> are functionally weaker. It can be speculated that this shift towards memory <b>spines</b> contributes to enhanced retention of remote memories typically seen in the elderly. Gaining further insight in <b>spine</b> plasticity regulation, its homeostatic nature and how to maintain <b>spine</b> health will be important future research topics in Neuroscience...|$|R

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{throughout}} the year, {{but there is}} a peak that enables the birds to make use of periods that food is plenty, such as between August and December in South Sudan and between March and May in eastern Africa. Three or four eggs are laid in a roofed nest, that is suspended from a thin branch an in ant-gall acacia (Vachellia drepanolobium), or another <b>spined</b> and ant-housing acacia. The nest consists of grass straws, and during breeding and feeding the nestlings has one downward-facing opening. Eggs are approximately 19mm long and 14mm in diameter, greenish, bluish or white, unadorned or with fine black or olive colored specks, more dense at thick end, or so heavily blotched that the overall color seems olive-brown or ash-grey. Both parents share breeding duty but the female about twice as often as the male, until after thirteen or fourteen days, the eggs hatch.|$|E
25|$|The Banggai {{cardinalfish}} is {{the only}} member of its family that is diurnal. It is a demersal tropical marine fish that forms stable groups of about 9 individuals in shallow water, being most common at 1.5 to 2.5 meters in depth. It inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and open areas of sand and rubble. It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands. It is often found associated with the seagrass Enhalus acoroides and the long <b>spined</b> sea urchin Diadema setosum. It occurs among various living benthic substrates such as sea urchins, sea anemones, and branching corals; young fish are most commonly associated with sea anemones, while juveniles and adults occur most frequently among long-spined sea urchins and branching corals, as well as sea stars, hydrozoans, and mangrove prop roots. Individuals of 2 to 60 hover above the urchins, with the younger ones about 2 to 3 centimeters SL staying closest to them. The fish retreat among the spines when threatened. Individual fish exhibit well-defined homing behaviour and return to the original location of their group when disturbed. The Banggai cardinalfish often coexists with various anemonefish and anemone shrimp when sheltering in anemones and corals; when found among sea urchin spines, it associates with several other genera of cardinalfish. Following removal of the fish by aquarium collectors, the abundance of associated invertebrates has been shown to decline.|$|E

40|$|Dendritic <b>spines,</b> {{the site}} of most {{excitatory}} synapses in the brain, are lost in Alzheimer’s disease and in related mouse models, undoubtedly contributing to cognitive dysfunction.

To investigate effects of plaques on <b>spine</b> stability in vivo, we observed cortical neurons using multiphoton microscopy in a mouse model of amyloid pathology before and after extensive plaque deposition. We also observed age-matched nontransgenic mice to study normal effects of aging on <b>spine</b> plasticity.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{cautious}} outlook towards neck injuries {{has been}} the norm to avoid missing cervical <b>spine</b> injuries. Consequently {{there has been an}} increased use of cervical <b>spine</b> radiography. The Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was proposed to reduce unnecessary use of cervical <b>spine</b> radiography in alert and stable patients. Our aim was to see whether applying the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule reduced the need for cervical <b>spine</b> radiography without missing significant cervical <b>spine</b> injuries. Methods This was a retrospective study conducted in 2 hospitals. 114 alert and stable patients who had cervical <b>spine</b> radiographs for suspected neck injuries were included in the study. Data on patient demographics, high risk & low risk factors as per the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule and cervical <b>spine</b> radiography results were collected and analysed. Results 28 patients were included in the high risk category according to the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule. 86 patients fell into the low risk category. If the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was applied, {{there would have been a}} significant reduction in cervical <b>spine</b> radiographs as 86 / 114 patients (75. 4 %) would not have needed cervical <b>spine</b> radiograph. 2 / 114 patients who had significant cervical <b>spine</b> injuries would have been identified when the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was applied.
