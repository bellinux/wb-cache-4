A variety of {{organizations}} use <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> to structure events: alumni associations, chambers of commerce, business associations, universities and trade shows.

5000|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>networking</b> {{is often}} {{referenced}} as a derivative of speed dating, the round-robin approach to meeting potential suitors first developed by Rabbi Yaacov Deyo {{in the late}} 1990s. <b>Speed</b> <b>networking,</b> a more recent concept, arose from the combination of speed dating and business networking and {{is thought to have}} started in the United States and, perhaps, simultaneously in the United Kingdom. [...] <b>Speed</b> <b>networking</b> was first utilized during the US economic downturn of the early 2000s and began rising in popularity as the decade drew to a close. Credit for applying speed dating concepts to the corporate world has been attributed to Tom Jaffee, a Columbia MBA alumnus and founder of a speed-dating network. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> was introduced by Michael Piddock, future founder of event technology company Glisser, to increase employee-to-employee connections in corporate events. Although the techniques for speed dating and <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> can be similar - individuals paired or grouped together for the purpose of introduction - the practices differ in their end goals. Speed daters are trying to narrow down their choices by eliminating the unsuitable; conversely, speed networkers are trying to broaden their connections by increasing their exposure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>networking</b> can {{be based}} on one of three models: meeting random {{attendees}} sequentially in a round robin, meeting with specific people based on preassigned match ups (the first two models are one-on-one), or a third assembly-based model where individuals speak to a preselected group.Most <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> events begin {{in the style of}} a more traditional meeting: an open room for mingling. Following this open forum, during which drinks or food may be served, the event can be called to order by the host who explains the structure of the event, which differs slightly based on the available models (see below).In general, <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> events all have time limits placed on the interactions and a moderator that will time and announce these intervals. In addition, if the <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> model calls for specific movements of participants (to a preassigned table or group, for example) then the moderator would also facilitate these details.|$|E

50|$|In the station-based {{model of}} <b>speed</b> <b>networking,</b> {{attendees}} {{meet each other}} individually based on a pre-assignment. Prior to coming to the event, attendees fill out a questionnaire listing their business background (job title and industry) and whom they wish to meet (suppliers, customers or vendors).

At the event, numbered stations are set up where attendees meet with their assigned partners according to their list for a set period of time.

50|$|In the group-based {{model of}} <b>speed</b> <b>networking</b> {{attendees}} {{do not meet}} individually but instead are assigned to a sequence of tables. Each table seats a specific number of participants, depending on attendance. A typical event may call for tables of four to 10. Table assignments are often predetermined by computer software but other techniques {{can be used to}} determine the groups each attendee participates in. Each person at the table takes a few minutes - the length of these introductions can also be set - to introduce him or herself. Time at the table varies based on how the event organiser coordinate the event but usually lasts five to 15 minutes.|$|E
