5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and test a {{modeling}} procedure, as researchers have struggled for decades to develop <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> growth models that are both theoretically founded and empirically validated. This article presents the concept and hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> the history <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> models and a procedure that may serve as a useful tool in modeling <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> growth. Design/methodology/approach – Based on previous research and lessons learned from case study experience of the government sector in Norway, a procedure for the <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> growth modeling process is suggested and demonstrated. The procedure was used developing a stage model for e-government interoperability.

The paper proposes a new approach to <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> growth modeling. Originality/value – The utility of the suggested procedure is to improve theory building and empirical validation.
