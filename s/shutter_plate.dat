5000|$|... 1861: Thomas Sutton (UK) {{received}} {{first patent}} for SLR photographic camera. An unknown number made but very few; no known production model; no known surviving examples. The manually levered reflex mirror {{also served as}} the camera's <b>shutter.</b> Used glass <b>plates.</b>|$|R
40|$|During the 1930 s meteor {{astronomy}} {{entered a}} new era when the Canadian astronomer, Peter Millman, began investigating the spectra of meteors for his post-graduate studies at Harvard University. Whilst experimenting with different lenses, prisms, <b>shutters,</b> photographic <b>plates,</b> and observational techniques, Millman constructed {{a number of different}} meteor spectrographs, and by conducting systematic photographic surveys between November 1931 and February 1933 almost tripled the number of meteor spectra known to exist. Through these efforts, {{in less than two years}} he was responsible for single-handedly launching a whole new field of meteor investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{simulation}} study which examines {{the use of}} zone plates for lithography. Zone-Plate-Array Lithography (ZPAL) is a maskless lithography scheme that uses an array of <b>shuttered</b> zone <b>plates</b> to print arbitrary patterns in resist on a substrate. We have demonstrated a working ZPAL system in the UV regime, and are pursuing further experiments with the 4. 5 nm X-ray to obtain smaller feature sizes. A general numerical simulation tool, based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory, has been developed. A pattern will consist of many pixels exposed independently in the resist. Various zone plate and system parameters will affect the intensity distribution at the focal plane. We present simulation results which show {{the effect of these}} parameters on both the individual spots and exposed patterns...|$|R
50|$|Damage {{can occur}} during the casting and de-{{shuttering}} processes. For instance, {{the corners of}} beams can be damaged during the removal of shuttering because they are less effectively compacted by means of vibration (improved by using form-vibrators). Other physical damage {{can be caused by}} the use of steel <b>shuttering</b> without base <b>plates.</b> The steel <b>shuttering</b> pinches the top surface of a concrete slab due to the weight of the next slab being constructed.|$|R
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the bulky size of the view camera, Weston boasted he could [...] "set up the tripod, fasten the camera {{securely}} to it, attach the lens to the camera, open the shutter, study {{the image on the}} ground glass, focus it, close the <b>shutter,</b> insert the <b>plate</b> holder, cock the shutter, set it to the appropriate aperture and speed, remove the slide from the plate holder, make the exposure, replace the slide, and remove the plate holder in two minutes and twenty seconds." ...|$|R
50|$|LCD {{shutters}} {{consist of}} a stack of three primary elements. On the bottom and top of the <b>shutter</b> are polarizer <b>plates</b> set at right angles. Normally light cannot travel through a pair of polarizers arranged in this fashion, and the display would be black. The polarizers also carry the directors to create the twisted structure aligned with the polarizers on either side. As the light flows out of the rear polarizer, it will naturally follow the liquid crystal's twist, exiting {{the front of the}} liquid crystal having been rotated through the correct angle, that allows it to pass through the front polarizer. LCDs are normally transparent in this mode of operation.|$|R
5000|$|A few minor {{modifications}} {{were also}} made to internal parts, notably {{to the film}} pressure plate spring that changes {{through a variety of}} shapes from rod to flat shape. Most, if not all shutters alternatives have a No. 5 Cable Release socket with a tiny removable coin-slotted screw plug, while the later ones also have a Kodak type flash synchroniser contact post. A metal band inscribed [...] "Made in U.S.A." [...] was attached {{to the top of the}} <b>shutter</b> housing cover <b>plate,</b> save for the last year or two of production. The milling pattern on the focusing wheel front goes through a variety of styles from flat to a pattern of several concentric circles.|$|R
5000|$|When Nordenskiöld {{arrived in}} Durango he made {{arrangements}} {{to stay with}} Cattle rancher Richard Wetherill at the Alamo Ranch in Mancos, CO. This is confirmed in a 2 July 1893 letter to his father in which he requests his photographic equipment, consisting of camera, tripod, lens, cassette for photographic <b>plates,</b> <b>shutter,</b> dark cloth, and [...] "as well as my barometer". (Letters Letter No. 15, The Letters of Gustaf Nordenskiöld Mesa Verde 1991.) He also says in the same letter that his father should answer by telegram whether he should remain where he is. He worked with Wetherill, discoverer of the Mesa Verde ruins in 1888, and Charles Mason. The Wetherill's led Nordenskiöld through the canyons and sandstone cliffs of the Mesa Verde ruins where he applied his European scientific training, conducting the first archaeological excavation of the cliff dwellings. Nordenskiöld employed Wetherill to supervise excavations at Mesa Verde and trained Wetherill {{in a number of}} techniques, such as how to use a trowel (he had been using a shovel). Nordenskiöld explained to Wetherill the importance of documentation.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, Lloyd Cross {{opened the}} San Francisco School of Holography and taught amateurs {{how to make}} {{holograms}} using only a small (typically 5 mW) helium-neon laser and inexpensive home-made equipment. Holography had been supposed to require a very expensive metal optical table set-up to lock all the involved elements down in place and damp any vibrations that could blur the interference fringes and ruin the hologram. Cross's home-brew alternative was a sandbox made of a cinder block retaining wall on a plywood base, supported on stacks of old tires to isolate it from ground vibrations, and filled with sand that had been washed to remove dust. The laser was securely mounted atop the cinder block wall. The mirrors and simple lenses needed for directing, splitting and expanding the laser beam were affixed to short lengths of PVC pipe, which were stuck into the sand at the desired locations. The subject and the photographic plate holder were similarly supported within the sandbox. The holographer turned off the room light, blocked the laser beam near its source using a small relay-controlled <b>shutter,</b> loaded a <b>plate</b> into the holder in the dark, left the room, waited {{a few minutes to}} let everything settle, then made the exposure by remotely operating the laser shutter.|$|R
40|$|A {{special-purpose}} high-voltage {{power supply}} can be electronically switched on and off with fast rise and fall times, respectively. The output potential is programmable from 20 to 1, 250 V. An output current of 50 A can be sustained at 1, 250 V. The power supply was designed specifically for electronically <b>shuttering</b> a microchannel <b>plate</b> in an x-ray detector that must operate with exposure times as short as 1 ms. The basic design of the power supply is also adaptable to other applications {{in which there are}} requirements for rapid slewing of high voltages. The power-supply circuitry (see figure) includes a preregulator, which is used to program the output at 1 / 30 of the desired output potential. After the desired voltage has been set, the outputs of a pulse width modulator (PWM) are enabled and used to amplify the preregulator output potential by 30. The amplification is achieved by use of two voltage doublers with a transformer that has two primary and two secondary windings. A resistor is used to limit the current by controlling the drive voltage of two field-effect transistors (FETs) during turn-on of the PWM. A pulse transformer is used to turn on four FETs to short-circuit four output capacitors when the outputs of the PWM have been disabled. The most notable aspects of the performance of the power supply are a rise time of only 80 s and a fall time of only 60 s at a load current of 50 A or less. Another notable aspect is that the application of a 0 -to- 5 -V square wave to a shutdown pin of the PWM causes the production of a 0 -to- 1, 250 -V square wave at the output terminals...|$|R
40|$|The Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, BMRR, is a 3 MW heterogeneous, tank-type, {{light water}} cooled and moderated, {{graphite}} reflected reactor, {{which was designed}} for biomedical studies. Early BNL work in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) used a beam of thermal neutrons for experimental treatment of brain tumors. Research elsewhere and at BNL indicated that higher energy neutrons {{would be required to}} treat deep seated brain tumors. Epithermal neutrons would be thermalized as they penetrated the brain and peak thermal neutron flux densities would occur at the depth of brain tumors. One of the two BMRR thermal port shutters was modified in 1988 to include plates of aluminum and aluminum oxide to provide an epithermal port. Lithium carbonate in polyethylene was added in 1991 around the bismuth port to reduce the neutron flux density coming from outside the port. To enhance the epithermal neutron flux density, the two vertical thimbles A- 3 (core edge) and E- 3 (in core) were replaced with fuel elements. There are now four fuel elements of 190 grams each and 28 fuel elements of 140 grams each for a total of 4. 68 kg of {sup 235 }U in the core. The authors have proposed replacing the epithermal shutter with a fission converter <b>plate</b> <b>shutter.</b> It is estimated that the new shutter would increase the epithermal neutron flux density by a factor of seven and the epithermal/fast neutron ratio by a factor of two. The modifications made to the BMRR {{in the past few years}} permit BNCT for brain tumors without the need to reflect scalp and bone flaps. Radiation workers are monitored via a TLD badge and a self-reading dosimeter during each experiment. An early concern was raised about whether workers would be subject to a significant dose rate from working with patients who have been irradiated. The gamma ray doses for the representative key personnel involved in the care of the first 12 patients receiving BNCT are listed. These workers did not receive unusually high exposures...|$|R
