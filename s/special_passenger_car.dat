Many commuter trains are pushed from the back by the locomotive, including Metrolink trains returning to Los Angeles Union Station. [...] In a [...] "rear-pushed configuration," [...] the first car is a <b>special</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> with controls for an engineer at the end (sometimes {{referred to as the}} [...] "cab car"). This [...] "rear-pushed configuration" [...] eliminates the need for elaborate turnaround maneuvers and facilities to reverse a train's direction. There was severe criticism that the configuration made the accident worse: many people claimed that if the heavier engine were ahead of the passenger cars southbound train #100 would not have jackknifed, causing the second train to derail.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 This {{dissertation}} analyses the {{determinants of}} demand for new passenger vehicles in South Africa over a ten-year period, between 1995 and 2005. The following investigation into {{the determinants of}} demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars,</b> is based both on a statistical and empirical analysis {{of the performance of}} the South African new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> market. Firstly, in Chapter 2 a brief history of the South African motor in industry provides a background for the analysis which follows in this dissertation and gives some insight into the historical developments that created the structure of the industry during the period analysed by the study. The theoretical components of the thesis focus on the macro-economic theory of demand, which seeks to explain the influences which determine consumer demand when purchasing durable goods and more specifically new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars.</b> Chapter 3 explains how consumers trade off preferences and substitutes in their efforts to maximise their utility. When comparing the general theory of demand to the theory of demand for durable goods and more specifically the theory of demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars,</b> it is demonstrated that the theory of demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> is inherently different to that of non-durable goods. New <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> and other durable goods require a relatively higher investment, last longer than non-durable goods and literally retain some of their value, as they get older. Chapter 3 creates a theoretical foundation upon which the determinants of demand for <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> will be analysed in Chapter 4. Chapter 4 forms the base upon which the South African New <b>Passenger</b> <b>Car</b> Market will to be analysed. In Chapter 4 the study statistically and graphically analyses the primary economic determinants of demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars.</b> The analyses first present the relationship between price and new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> demand. It was found that demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> was price elastic. It was also identified that price elasticity of demand changed over the ten-year period analysed. Next, the impact of population growth and personal disposable income on new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> demand was analysed. It was discovered that should the population grow faster than the economy; relative prices unchanged, personal disposable income will decline and thereby affect desired stocks of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> negatively. The effect of disposable income on the sale of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> was found to be income inelastic. Income elasticity also, however displayed signs of change over the analysed period. The effect of the rate of interest on the demand for the new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> was also analysed. The analysis indicated that changes in interest rates resulted in changes of various proportions in all rates of interest in the economy; such an effect filtered through to the new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> market. After this, the effect of GDP on the demand for new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> was examined. The examination found that changes in the new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> market correlated very closely with GDP growth changes, hence GDP changes served as an important indicator of the new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> market. The result of changes in the price of fuel on new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> demand was also examined. The result showed that the structure of the market, i. e. the size of cars, etc. was more affected than the volume of sales. Finally, the effect of the level of confidence in new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> demand was analysed. Business and consumer confidence were found to be good indicators of the new <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> market. Chapter 5 concluded and summarised the findings of the dissertation. The study also noted that the effects of South Africa’s upgraded public transport system {{in the form of the}} Bus Rapid Transport System (BRT) and the Gautrain on the demands of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> could be a case for future research.

The changes in gasoline consumption in Japan were attributed to five factors: (1) change in the annual average driving distance of new and vintage cars, (2) change in the market share of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars,</b> (3) change in {{the total number of}} new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars,</b> (4) change in the fuel economy of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars,</b> and (5) change in the stock of vintage cars. We used the IDA results to estimate the economy-wide direct rebound effect, where improved fuel mileage causes additional travel. We found that the total gasoline saved by shifting from vintage ordinary <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> to both new kei <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> and new hybrid cars during fiscal 2006 – 2007 amounted to 395 ML, while about half of the gasoline savings from car replacement were lost by the direct rebound effects.
