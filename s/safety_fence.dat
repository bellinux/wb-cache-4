5|$|The Lake Hefner Parkway {{opened in}} 1992. SH-74 was {{transferred}} to the new freeway on April 6. Between April and July 2001, ODOT installed a Brifen <b>Safety</b> <b>Fence</b> cable barrier along the Lake Hefner Parkway section of SH-74. This installation was the first application of this barrier design in the United States. The freeway was extended from its former terminus just north of the Kilpatrick Turnpike to 164th Street in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Another monument, {{built in}} front of the Legislative Assembly, on the former Panama City-Canal Zone limits {{consists}} on a life-sized monument {{in the form of a}} lamppost, with three figures climbing it to raise their flag. The monument reflects the photograph that was on the cover of Life, in which three students scaled the 12 foot high <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> and climbed a lamppost and the one in the top had a Panamanian flag.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{was born}} in Espoo. He had {{a long line of}} success in karting from the age of 10. His first race outside Finland was in Monaco when he was 15 years old. During the race, the {{steering}} wheel broke, but he continued, informing his mechanic by frantically waving the steering wheel in the air on the home straight. Räikkönen's next Monaco race was also memorable; he was thrown {{on the wrong side of}} the <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> in a first lap collision but continued driving until running out of road. Undeterred, he lifted his kart back onto the track and continued to race. His mechanic thought Räikkönen had retired, but he eventually caught up with the other competitors and finished third. In 1998 he was 1st in the Nordic Championship at Varna in Norway. In 1999, Räikkönen placed second in the European Formula Super A championship for the Dutch PDB Racing Team– run by 1980 world champion Peter de Bruijn– utilising a Gillard chassis. He also competed in the Formula Ford Euro Cup. By the age of twenty, he had won the British Formula Renault winter series of 1999, winning the first four races of the year. In 2000, he won seven out of ten events in the Formula Renault UK Championship. Combined, over these two series of Formula Renault, he won 13 out of 23 events– a 56% win rate.|$|E

50|$|After {{completion}} of upgrading the A66 between Greta Bridge-Scotch Corner in 2007, two pegasus crossings were {{installed on the}} section of the dual carriageway in 2009, immediately to the west of Scotch Corner. These crossings included raised buttons for horse riders, <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> and lights to control the traffic which consisted of only two orange lights. These crossings never became operational and {{with the exception of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> were later removed.|$|R
40|$|This report {{proceeds}} from the basic idea that the risk factor of <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> should be {{less than that of}} the danger so it screens off. The safer the fence the greater its field of application. Definition: discontinuities are places where <b>safety</b> <b>fences</b> undergo an abrupt change with regard to their geometry of mechanical qualities. For elementary discontinuities solutions are suggested. In the first place the report addresses itself to the road controller...|$|R
500|$|Footpaths [...] wide {{on either}} side of the bridge were formed by {{concrete}} cast in situ and cantilevered out from the adjacent beams. These footpaths were separated from the roadway and the bridge's edge by lightweight aluminium balustrades and safety fences installed by Bristile. The street lights were integrated into the <b>safety</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{sculpture}} was surveyed {{and considered}} [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in March 1995. [...] After Conrad died in 2010, {{the city of}} Santa Monica began to reevaluate the structural integrity of the sculpture. In June 2011, an inspector observed children climbing the sculpture. [...] Safety tests were performed showing that the underlying structure built using fiberglass and copper chains was stable. [...] However, questions were raised about the long term integrity of [...] the fiberglass. An inspection found rust and corrosion on the steel frame skeleton and the revealed that the anchor bolts holding the sculpture to the base were weakened. Shortly after the inspection, the city installed a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> around the sculpture to protect the public.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{continued}} silence {{would seem}} a radical but also inconvenient form of communication, several Western authors recognized the social value of silence. Among those were Jacques Derrida and Søren Kierkegaard. In their view, silence would {{function as a}} precursor for clearer and substantively deeper understanding. Michael Strawser (Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Central Florida), commenting on Jacques Derrida's view of Soren Kierkegaard's meaning of silence, wrote, [...] "What is needed is Kierkegaard's call to silence in order to recognize one's responsibility to the other." [...] Silence is also valued by Perkey Avot, in the Jewish Sages guide for living, and functions as [...] "a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> for wisdom".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1948 the tarmac cycle track was dug up and {{replaced}} with a [...] speedway track. A steel <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> was erected around {{the outside of the}} track and the football pitch remained within the centre of the track. The first speedway meeting took place in the stadium on 26 April 1948, in tragic circumstances. The match against the Yarmouth Bloaters, which Poole won 74–32, saw Yarmouth's Reg Craven killed in the first race in the very first match at the track. A sheltered 1,100 seat grandstand was erected on the home straight in 1960 and is still in use. The terracing on the back straight of the speedway track was demolished in 1997 and replaced with a new glass fronted grandstand incorporating a 440 seat restaurant, two bars, Tote betting facilities and multiple viewing screens. The speedway track was reduced in size to [...] to accommodate a new greyhound track. Stadia UK were issued a long term lease on the stadium by the council, with the Pirates promotion sub-leasing use of the stadium and facilities from Stadia UK.|$|E
50|$|The {{speedway}} {{track was}} unusual {{because it did}} not have a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> as the stock car circuit acted as a run-off area. It was not until 1991 that a <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> was installed, but the lack of fence encouraged the riders to ride wider lines than they would otherwise have done.|$|E
50|$|The shaft is {{open and}} well defined behind a chain wire <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> (14m x 14m) that was erected in the late 1960s by the Charters Towers City Council. A {{temporary}} wire chain <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> {{has been placed on}} the eastern side presumably to render safe this side from subsidence. The shaft {{is open and}} intact. 50 metres to the south-west is a brick magazine. Substantial foundations for mine machinery associated with the mine lie to the north. The Day Dawn PC No. 4 is in evidence to the east as has a temporary <b>safety</b> <b>fence</b> around it. The USL on which the shaft lies is heavily grassed and is generally clear of other built or natural features.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} {{acquired}} {{in at least}} three parcels between 1929 and 1952. The Civilian Conservation Corps installed a fresh water system, sanitary works, picnic tables, stoves, trails, and <b>safety</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Railway <b>Safety</b> <b>Fencing</b> Board (Stängselnämnden) was a Swedish {{government}} {{agency responsible for}} settling conflicts between municipalities and rail transport companies regarding the building of fences along railways.

50|$|Road works (speed limit {{changed from}} 70mph to 50mph, speed cameras, better <b>safety</b> <b>fencing,</b> banning cyclists from the road, slip road changes) {{finished}} {{at the start}} of 2000 reduced traffic collisions and crashes by 60%. Before this it was having 26 vehicle collisions and crashes a year with 40 people injured.|$|R
5000|$|The {{greatest}} risk reduction {{in terms of}} head-on collision comes through the separation of oncoming traffic, also known as median separation or median treatment, which can reduce road collisions {{in the order of}} 70%.

25|$|In 1970 {{extensive}} sandblasting {{was conducted}} on all the steel components of the Waibaidu bridge to remove all rust.

50|$|Depending on {{the design}} of the race track, the main corner station may also have other {{subordinate}} stations behind barricades or protective <b>safety</b> <b>fencing,</b> where workers are stationed (a) to be closer to a possible area where crashes are likely, or (b) {{to be in a position}} where they can respond to an incident without crossing the track.|$|R
