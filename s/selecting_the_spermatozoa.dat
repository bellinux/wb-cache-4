40|$|Some stallions produce ejaculates of {{low quality}} and/or low {{fertility}} when used for artificial insemination (AI). The {{purpose of these}} five case studies was to use Single Layer Centrifugation (SLC) to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> best <b>spermatozoa</b> from problem ejaculates for subsequent use in AI. Sperm quality, in terms of motility, morphology and chromatin integrity, was improved in the SLC-selected samples compared to the corresponding uncentrifuged samples, {{with the exception of}} one stallion thought to have ampullary stasis. In this stallion, neither <b>the</b> incidence of <b>spermatozoa</b> with detached heads nor the proportion of damaged chromatin was decreased by SLC, in contrast to previous results. Pregnancies were obtained after using SLC-selected <b>spermatozoa</b> from <b>the</b> five stallions for AI, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> were functional after SLC. Overall, the results suggest that SLC may be useful when preparing AI doses from some problem ejaculates. This is the pre-reviewed version of the following article: J. M. Morrell, G. Mari, G.

40|$|The {{current review}} {{summarizes}} {{progress in the}} field of in vitro and in vivo production of South American Camelid embryos. Both methods require ovarian superstimulation (with FSH and eCG) to obtain multiple ovulations (in vivo embryo production) or to induce follicle growth for oocyte collection (in vitro embryo production). Moreover, superstimulation entails prior administration of hormones that inhibit follicular growth (progesterone, progestagens, and estrogens). Cumulus-oocyte complexes obtained must mature in vivo (buserelin administration) or in vitro to then be subjected to in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. All these techniques also require morphologically normal, motile spermatozoa to achieve fertilization. Methods used to decrease semen viscosity and to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> best <b>spermatozoa</b> (Percoll®; Androcoll-ETM) are described. Additionally, nuclear transfer or cloning has been applied in llamas. Up to now, embryo deep-freezing and vitrification have progressed slowly but are at the height of development. Embryos that are obtained by any of these techniques, either in vivo or in vitro, need to be transferred to synchronized recipient females. The best results are achieved after transfer to the left uterine horn with an ipsilateral ovulation. No live offspring have been obtained after the transfer of cryopreserved embryos. Applying reproductive biotechnologies, such as those described, will permit the expansion of genetically <b>selected</b> animals in <b>the</b> population and also that of wild camelid species, vicunas, and guanacos, whose embryos could then be transferred to the uterus of domestic species...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of human spermatozoa to penetrate methylcellulose (MC) and to compare this with penetration in hyaluronic acid. METHODS: Spermatozoa from normal (≥ 20 × 106 sperm/ml, ≥ 50 % progressive motility, ≥ 5 % normal forms) and oligozoospermic (< 20 × 106 sperm/ml) semen samples were allowed to swim into glass capillary tubes containing methylcellulose with a viscosity of 15 centipoise (cp) (MC 15) and 4000 cp (MC 4000), hyaluronic acid (rooster comb) or Sperm <b>Select.</b> Penetration of <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> at 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm were correlated with basic semen parameters (concentration, motility and morphology). The effects of temperature on penetration into MC 4000 were explored at 17 – 37 °C. RESULTS: Higher numbers of spermatozoa penetrated MC 4000 (10 mg/ml) compared with MC 15 and the hyaluronic acid preparations. There was a highly significant correlation between <b>the</b> number of <b>spermatozoa</b> at all migration distances in MC 4000 (10 mg/ml) and semen parameters. Increases in temperature from 17 – 37 °C were accompanied by significantly higher numbers of spermatozoa at each penetration distance. MC 4000 at 10 mg/ml was at least as favourable to sperm penetration as human cervical mucus. Effective discrimination between normal and abnormal samples was achieved using MC 4000 (10 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the potential use of methylcellulose (MC 4000, 10 mg/ml) as a reproducible and effective alternative to hyaluronic acid in sperm migration tests...|$|R

The non motile testicular <b>spermatozoa</b> from <b>the</b> testis exhibited different patterns of motility, when incubated with the luminal contents of different regions of <b>the</b> epididymis. <b>The</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> from <b>the</b> testis, different regions of the epididymis exhibited 8 different patterns of motility (a-h). Testicular <b>spermatozoa</b> incubated with <b>the</b> anterior and middle epididymal luminal contents showed the motility patterns almost similar to that of <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> of <b>the</b> anterior and middle epididymis respectively. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> of <b>the</b> posterior epididymis, none of <b>the</b> testicular <b>spermatozoa</b> showed any movement when incubated with the posterior epididymal luminal contents. This study throws light on the importance of each region of epididymis in the physiological maturation of spermatozoa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMorphology of <b>the</b> {{crayfish}} <b>spermatozoon</b> and of <b>the</b> spermatophore wall {{during three}} stages of final maturation including freshly ejaculated, post-mating, and after spermatozoa release was studied and compared. The crayfish spermatophore {{consists of a}} sperm mass enveloped by a three layered spermatophore wall. After mating, {{the thickness of the}} outer layer of the spermatophore is increased. The matrix in the middle layer of the spermatophore becomes reticulated, and granules inside this layer release their contents. Fibers in the inner layer degrade to small particles. <b>The</b> <b>spermatozoon</b> capsule swells and the space between the capsule and <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoon</b> appears. <b>The</b> area of the plasma membrane is increased by wrinkling of the surface and alteration from a single to a multilayered structure at the anterior part of the acrosome. The density of the subacrosome zone increases {{in the vicinity of the}} main body of the acrosome. With the onset of fertilization, the layers of the spermatophore are dissolved by female glair gland secretions. <b>The</b> <b>spermatozoon</b> extracellular capsule, plasma membrane, and membranous lamellae are eliminated, and bundles of filaments are released from anterior part of the acrosome. The subacrosome zone loses electron density and retracts. The electron-dense material of the innermost layer of the acrosome is discharged and, together with acrosome filaments, forms a filament/droplet structure at the anterior part of <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoon.</b> <b>The</b> most important change is observed in the subacrosome zone, which may play a key role in the fertilization. Also, morphological changes of <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoon</b> that occur after release from the capsule, especially formation of the filament/droplet structure, may contribute to the mechanism of egg-spermatozoon binding in the crayfish, representative of animals with non-motile spermatozoa...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> mature <b>spermatozoa</b> of four {{species of}} European decapod crabs (Clibanarius erythropus, Maja squinado, Cancer pagurusand Potamon fluviatile) have been {{investigated}} using indirect immuno‐fluorescence techniques {{for the presence of}} the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin. Indirect immunofluorescence labelling with monoclonal anti‐actin antibody and three different monoclonal anti‐tubulin antibodies indicate that actin is present in <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> of all four species, but tubulins are restricted to the two species with microtubular arms, Clibanariusand Maja. The pattern of actin fluorescence varies between <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> of <b>the</b> four species, with Majaand Cancershowing intense fluorescence in the acrosome vesicle and in elements of the sperm cell involved in the acrosome reaction. <b>The</b> <b>spermatozoon</b> of each species is described ultrastructurally using transmission electron microscopy and correlations made between observed patterns of fluorescence and the cellular components described. No obvious filamentous actin (F‐actin) is visible in the electron micrographs of <b>the</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> of any of the species. In most cases the fluorescence is sufficiently specific to indicate in which region of the mature sperm cell the actin and tubulin occurs. Actin is acrosomal in Maja, Cancerand Potamonbut appears to be cytoplasmic in Clibanarius, while the tubulins appear only to be present in the cytoplasm of Clibanarius, Majaand Cancer. 1994 The Royal Swedish Academy of Science...|$|R
