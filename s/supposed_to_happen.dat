5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|Traveling to {{the ruined}} city of Paddra in 10 AF, they find Hope, {{who has become}} {{the leader of the}} Academy, with Alyssa as his assistant. They also find a {{recording}} of prophecies made by one of the seeresses of Paddra, who are believed to have died out centuries prior: one fragmented prophecy shows Lightning in Valhalla. Paddra is shrouded by an eclipse, which Noel says is not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for several centuries. While Serah and Noel resolve the paradox causing the eclipse, they encounter Caius Ballad, a man Noel knows from 700 AF who opposes their mission, and Yeul, who looks identical to a girl of the same name Noel knew in the future. After resolving the paradox, an alternative timeline appears in which there was never an eclipse. The repaired prophecy shows Caius in Valhalla fighting Lightning and the pillar supporting Cocoon collapsing. Noel claims that this takes place around 400 AF, devastating the human population as well as the world, creating a future where he is the last human in existence. Serah and Noel move on, while Hope and Alyssa work on finding a way to prevent the pillar's collapse.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the above {{definition of the}} probability mass function, note that the probability for every specific sequence of knbsp&successes and rnbsp&failures is , because the outcomes of the knbsp&+nbsp&r trials are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> independently. Since the rthnbsp&failure comes last, it remains to choose the knbsp&trials with successes out of the remaining knbsp&+nbsp&rnbsp&−nbsp&1 trials. The above binomial coefficient, due to its combinatorial interpretation, gives precisely the number of all these sequences of length knbsp&+nbsp&rnbsp&−nbsp&1.|$|E

Since then, France had been signing {{agreements}} with the different rotator presidencies of the EU (the Czech Republic, Sweden and Spain) in order to maintain the co-presidency for alongside Egypt. The renewal of the co-presidency was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> on the second Union for the Mediterranean Summit. However, due to the two postponements of the summit, there has been no chance to decide which countries will take over the co-presidency.|$|E

5000|$|The Hanau epe (also, hanau eepe: <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> mean [...] "Long-ears") were a semi-legendary {{people who}} {{are said to have}} lived in Easter Island, where they came into {{conflict}} with another people known as the Hanau momoko or [...] "short-ears". A decisive battle occurred which led to the defeat and extermination of the Hanau epe. According to the legend, these events are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> at some point between the 16th and 18th centuries, probably in the late 17th century.|$|R
50|$|Arrested in late 1640, Laud {{was held}} {{initially}} for tactical reasons {{in the struggle}} between Charles I of England and the English parliament. When charges were actually brought, their main thrust was that Laud had run an ecclesiastical state within a state.

25|$|Chigurh kills without {{compassion}} or remorse, {{but always}} with deliberation. He {{is described as}} having his own set of morals, however twisted they may be. While he does not kill at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract. He {{sees himself as a}} hand of fate; an instrument who exacts what is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> upon those he sees accountable. He gives many of his victims he faces a chance to survive by making deals either personally, or by flipping coins in making decisions. In the novel, he is depicted as having a great deal of endurance, such as being capable of withstanding pain from multiple shotgun blasts or from a fractured arm.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy {{was aware}} of the {{traditional}} planning of the Imperial Japanese Navy for war with the U.S., as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. The Japanese made no secret of it, and in the 1930s American radio intelligence gave U.S. war planners considerable insight in Japanese naval exercises. These plans presumed there would be a large decisive battle between Japanese and U.S. battleships, but this would be fought near Japan, after the numerical superiority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (assured by the Washington Naval Treaty, and still taken as given) was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces, such as destroyers and submarines. This strategy expected the Japanese fleet to take a defensive posture, awaiting U.S. attack, and it was confirmed by the Japanese Navy staff only three weeks before Pearl Harbor. In the 1920s, the decisive battle was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> near the Ryukyu islands; in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central Pacific, near the Marshall islands. War Plan Orange reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the Pacific. Yamamoto's decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the U.S. as far east as Pearl Harbor, and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the American battleships, was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark.|$|E
500|$|His second {{defense was}} against Neil Sinclair in Yorkshire, Great Britain. In {{the first round}} Sinclair's {{offensive}} was effective and he scored a knockdown on the defending champion. On the second round Santos responded to Sinclair's strategy and won the fight by knockout. Prior to the fight Sinclair noted that a fight between Santos and him was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> eight years before, [...] "We were both in the 1992 World junior championships in Montreal. We were {{both at the same}} weight and were at other side of the draw from each other and ended up with bronze medals. So I have watched him fight in person and shook hands on the podium. If we had both won our semi-finals we would have faced each other." [...] Sinclair also stated that he expected to win based on his training, he said that all of his sparring partners were southpaws since Santos is one, this preparation also included contracting a new trainer.|$|E

When Sita asked Rama to get her the deer, Rama followed the deer and killed it. This incident is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> near a place called Mrugavadhe in Thirthahalli Taluk. Mrugavadhe means Killing of an animal in the local Sanskrit language.|$|R

50|$|Gli Asolani (the {{people of}} Asolo) are dialogues in three books written between 1497 and 1504 by Pietro Bembo in the {{language}} of Petrarch and comprise his first important work. Although he had shown a copy to Lucrezia Borgia in 1503, the first edition from 1505 was published by Aldo Manuzio (Aldus Manutius), and the second edition was published, after various revisions, in 1530.They concern a dialogue on love that is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> at Asolo near the court of Caterina Cornaro.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E

50|$|Rama Cay Creole is a Creole {{language}} spoken by some 800 to 900 {{people on the}} island of Rama Cay in eastern Nicaragua. It is based on Miskito Coast Creole with additional elements of the Chibchan language Rama and purportedly some elements of English spoken with a German accent. The creolization of the language is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> when Moravian missionaries who were native Germans but preached in English encouraged the Rama-speaking population of the island to shift to English.|$|R

The André Saraiva-shot cover is unarguably a bit disturbing. As Styleite notes, [...] "What exactly is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> right before the shot was taken? Is she a damsel in distress that was just saved by del Toro (because that would have some pretty sexist undertones), {{or is it something}} more sinister?" ...|$|R

2500|$|As an {{unexpected}} {{benefit of the}} double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, [...] "As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and {{there was lots of}} rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> by the books". This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said: [...] "It's so sad. Boyzone and Stephen, they've {{all been}} part of Irish life and far wider than that, the last 15 years, and so successful, so it's a huge, huge tragedy. He was 33 years of age, 15 years at the top, a fine musician, it's just a huge tragedy to Irish entertainment, Irish music and further afield as well". Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen paid tribute: [...] "Stephen Gately was a gifted {{young man with a}} talent for singing which brought him {{tremendous}} success as a member of Boyzone and also as a West End star. There was a joy about his music making, and his death {{at such a young age}} is both a personal and professional loss". Andrew Lloyd Webber said it is [...] "a great loss to the musical world". Elton John said he and his partner David Furnish were [...] "stunned" [...] when they heard the news. Katherine Jenkins twittered of [...] "memories 2 cherish" [...] from a night out in the weeks leading up to his death. Stephen Fry described Gately's demise as [...] "a dreadful shock". [...] "This was not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> This was not in the script", said music historian Paul Gambaccini.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is a good}} scene <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>happened</b> between Sam Rogers and a lady of fashion--the reporter, Lord Dudley. Sam enters, takes a stool, creeps {{close to}} the lady's side, who asks his opinion of the last new poem or novel. In a pathetic voice the spectre replies--"My opinion? I like it very much--but the world don't like it; but, indeed, I begin to think the world wrong in everything, except with regard to you." [...] Now, Rogers either must have said this somewhere, or he has it yet to say. We dined at Lord Melville's.|$|R
2500|$|Sagen, best {{translated}} as [...] "legends", are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have actually <b>happened,</b> very often {{at a particular}} time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact.

Ghost and lovers' leap stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.|$|R
500|$|King {{took a year}} to {{consider}} what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that {{a large amount of}} the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral. There are several stories that, on a visit to Bath, King had a dream in which he [...] "saw the Heavenly Host on high with angels ascending and descending by ladder" [...] which is now represented on the west front of the cathedral.

60|$|The story, {{which runs}} through the second, third, and fourth cantos, may {{possibly}} owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents which happened, or were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> at Tahiti, in the interval between the final departure of the Bounty, September 21, 1789, {{and the arrival of}} the Pandora, March 23, 1791; but, as a whole, it is a work of fiction.|$|E
6000|$|Now [...] "The Arabian Nights," [...] some of which, but {{not nearly}} all, are given in this volume, are only fairy tales of the East. The people of Asia, Arabia, and Persia told them in their own way, not for children, but for grown-up people. There were no novels then, nor any printed books, of course; but there were people whose {{profession}} it was to amuse men and women by telling tales. They dressed the fairy stories up, and made the characters good Mahommedans, living in Bagdad or India. The events were often <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in {{the reign of the}} great Caliph, or ruler of the Faithful, Haroun al Raschid, who lived in Bagdad in 786-808 A.D. The vizir who accompanies the Caliph was also a real person of the great family of the Barmecides. He was put to death by the Caliph in a very cruel way, nobody ever knew why. The stories must have been told in their present shape a good long while after the Caliph died, when nobody knew very exactly what had really happened. At last some storyteller thought of writing down the tales, and fixing them into a kind of framework, as if they had all been narrated to a cruel Sultan by his wife. Probably the tales were written down about the time when Edward I. was fighting Robert Bruce. But changes were made in them at different times, and a great deal that is very dull and stupid was put in, and plenty of verses. Neither the verses nor the dull pieces are given in this book.|$|E
