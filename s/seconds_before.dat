Quarrel then rescues the couple.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significantly}} slower {{propagation of}} seismic waves {{compared to the}} near-speed-of-light transmission of Internet traffic, some Twitter users read about the earthquake <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> feeling the tremors. For example, Twitter users in such cities as New York City and Boston reported reading tweets about the earthquake from users in Washington, D.C., or Richmond, Virginia, 15 to 30seconds before feeling the quake itself.|$|E
5|$|Hourly Countdowns {{are used}} as {{practice}} to ready the crowd for the main countdown at midnight. Their theme and design reflect those as mentioned above. Some of the hourly countdowns started fifteen <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the hour. Since 2008, it has started at twenty seconds.|$|E

5|$|Most gamma-ray {{emitting}} {{sources are}} actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation {{for a few}} milliseconds to thousands of <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2009, Strasburg {{was drafted}} number one {{overall in the}} 2009 Major League Baseball Draft by the Washington Nationals. On August 17, 2009, he signed a record-breaking four-year, $15.1million {{contract}} with the Nationals, just 77 <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the deadline, shattering a dollar-amount record previously held by Mark Prior, who signed for $10.5million in 2001. Strasburg is represented by agent Scott Boras.|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth {{over the next few}} days. The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|E

5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant uses three {{different}} hunting strategies to catch its prey. Gleaning insects from a perch is its primary hunting strategy; while gleaning, the bird sits upright with its wings dropped below the tail, which is pointing straight down. From this position the tit-tyrant scans upwards into the vegetation {{for three to}} five <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> attacking, making them surprisingly deliberate hunters for a small flycatcher.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in <b>seconds,</b> <b>before</b> the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E

5|$|Famed writer Paul Sheldon (Brian) {{has just}} {{finished}} his latest and final installment in his series entitled Snuggly Jeff, a series of children's books in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work, despite objections from his agent, Marcia (Lois). While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing Paul to swerve {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> hitting the ground completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Gru finds Lucy {{strapped}} to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. After a comical 147 dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Margo, Edith and Agnes finally have someone close to a mother.|$|E
5|$|He turned {{professional}} at Burnley {{at the age}} of 17 {{on wages}} of £7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a £500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 <b>seconds,</b> <b>before</b> going on to record a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.|$|E

5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Testing {{then moved}} to Kwajalein. The first test on 21 March 1963 failed when the MTR failed to lock onto the missile. A second on 19 April also failed when the missile's {{tracking}} beacon failed 30 <b>seconds</b> <b>before</b> intercept. The third test, this time using an actual target consisting of an Agena-D upper stage equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually trained on the missile.|$|E
