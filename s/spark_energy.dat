25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less <b>spark</b> <b>energy</b> to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E

40|$|An {{introduction}} {{to the problems of}} ignition in the petrol and gas turbine engine is given. Two new ignition devices are considered for their suitability to overcome these problems and a series of experiments were performed to evaluate their relative merits. The use of a laser spark {{and the development of a}} plasma plug igniter were compared with <b>sparks</b> of variable <b>energy</b> produced between two electrodes. A simple combustion chamber was used for the experiments and ionisation probes were used to follow the propagation of the flame from the ignition source and through the gaseous mixtures. The conditions of the experiments were as follows: Pre-mixed methane/air of 1. 0, 0. 8 and 0. 6 stoichiometry Pressures 101 kN/m 2 - 1067 kN/m 2 Laser <b>spark</b> <b>energies</b> 30 mJ - 400 mJ Plasma plug energies 50 mJ - 1500 mJ Electrode <b>spark</b> <b>energies</b> 10 mJ - 2500 mJ Samples of the combustion products were taken and the results for the three mixture ratios are presented. The performances of the three ignition methods are presented by plotting the flame speeds observed from the ignition sources as functions of energy. Practical considerations eliminate the use of the laser as an ignition method but the plasma plug could be used for automotive applications if some control of the energy was exercised. The gas turbine engine appears to be the roost likely application of the plasma plug as it offers greater penetration into the combustion chamber than current surface discharge igniters. </p...|$|R

In this research work, an experimental investigation was introduced to achieve higher productivity of the wire electrode associated with sustainable production in terms of product quality and less heat-affected zone. For this purpose, the effects of machining parameters including peak current, pulse on time and wire preloading were investigated using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system along with the Taguchi method. From this study, the optimal setting of machining parameters to achieve higher productivity and sustainability was identified. Moreover, Neuro-fuzzy modeling was successfully used to build an empirical model for the selection of machining parameters to achieve higher productivity at highest possible surface quality and minimum cost for sustainable production.
