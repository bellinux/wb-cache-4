5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge <b>spreading</b> <b>fire</b> in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E
25|$|Several contradictions {{surround}} the entire event. The survivors on board stated {{that two people}} had died from injuries and burns from the probable blast {{of one of the}} motors. Meanwhile, one of them was seriously burned and sent by helicopter to Tirana for specialized treatment. Captain Santarelli, chief of the Guardia di Finanza clearly stated that there were no signs of fire on the boat. It was speculated the motor had suffered an unexpected small blast without <b>spreading</b> <b>fire,</b> instead just leading to fuel leakage.|$|E
25|$|The board {{found that}} the crew and {{passengers}} had not jumped immediately from the aircraft owing to several factors, including a loss of altitude while attempting to find an emergency field, the rapidly <b>spreading</b> <b>fire,</b> which blocked or impeded egress from the plane, {{and the fact that}} a sufficient number of parachutes were either not on board or were not being worn. Almost immediately following the crash, Prime Minister Churchill issued a directive requiring any test flights with civilians or scientific personnel to carry a sufficient number of parachutes for all individuals involved.|$|E
25|$|Various LSTs {{managed to}} move to safety under their own power or with {{assistance}} by tugboats. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, <b>spreading</b> <b>fires,</b> before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also <b>spread</b> <b>fires</b> to Tares 7 and 9 {{even though they had}} been unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8. Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the <b>spreading</b> <b>fires.</b> One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from a collision course with an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot.|$|R

25|$|Air Canada Flight 797 was a {{scheduled}} trans-border flight that flew from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Montréal–Dorval International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Toronto Pearson International Airport. On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer {{skin and the}} inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The <b>spreading</b> <b>fire</b> also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked {{out most of the}} instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft. Blood tests showed some of the passengers had inhaled lethal amounts of toxins from the in-flight fire, likely meaning they were already dead in their seats before the plane touched down.|$|E

2500|$|According to US-based Arconic, the {{polyethylene}} {{version of}} the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding [...] in height, {{because of the risk}} of <b>spreading</b> <b>fire</b> and smoke. NPR subsequently stated that nearly all jurisdictions in the US (except three states and the District of Columbia) have enacted the International Building Code (IBC) requirement that external wall assemblies (cladding, insulation, and wall) on high-rise buildings with combustible components must pass a rigorous real-world simulation test promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association under the name NFPA 285.|$|E
40|$|Wildfires {{and their}} {{associated}} destruction have highlighted {{the need for}} real-time simulation systems for accurately predicting <b>fire</b> <b>spread.</b> Such systems would assist fire managers {{in their efforts to}} effectively contain potentially catastrophic fires. Modeling and simulation of forest <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> using the cellular discrete event approach is based on dividing the forest into small areas called cells. <b>Fire</b> <b>spread</b> is then modeled as a contagion process between cells where forward <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> across each cell is computed using a mathematical <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> model. Rothermel’s mathematical <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> model allows for computing a onedimensional maximum forward spread rate and direction. <b>Fire</b> <b>spread</b> in all other directions is inferred from this forward spread rate. If this inference is not correctly abstracted it can lead to distortion of fire shapes and incorrect simulation results. This paper proposes a new two-dimensional <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> decomposition scheme for cellular DEVS models based on Rothermel’s mathematical <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> model. Preliminary simulation results demonstrating the proposed scheme are presented. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{model is}} by {{definition}} a simplification of the physical reality that includes some approximations. Quintiere ([2012]) raises several issues with using computer simulation for addressing fire problems. Phenomena like soot formation, <b>fire</b> <b>spread,</b> water droplet breakup and turbulent combustion are things that cannot be addressed adequately with a numerical model (Quintiere [2012]). Traditional small- and full-scale experiments capture these types of phenomena. Another issue is <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> and <b>fire</b> growth. Fire models do provide predictions of different output quantities given a user defined fire {{but it is difficult}} to simulate <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> and <b>fire</b> growth with the current models even with information from experimental measurements (Rein et al. [2011]).|$|R
2500|$|The actors {{remained}} in character {{for only a}} little while longer, the audience growing increasingly restive. In spite of their efforts, the stage hands could not snuff the fire out; instead they had inadvertently knocked burning material free, <b>spreading</b> <b>fire</b> to the rigging loft. Bits of flaming debris were beginning to fall, descending onto the box set and other properties spread around backstage. Dickinson, sitting in the center parquet, saw a thin wreath of smoke curling along {{the ceiling of the}} boxed-in scene. “Immediately afterward, one corner of the canvas ceiling was raised, and through the opening thus made I saw the flames, and saw men trying to rake the fire off the ceiling [...] with long poles.” With smoldering debris falling onto the stage, the actors fell out of character. Many in the audience, already restive, rose from their seats and commenced to crowd the aisles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those {{seated in the}} front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries. [...] Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The {{majority of}} the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door. [...] The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident, but was quickly closed due to the <b>spreading</b> <b>fire</b> on that side of the aircraft. [...] Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seat back of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.|$|E

50|$|The {{motion picture}} films show the <b>fire</b> <b>spreading</b> {{downward}} along {{the skin of}} the airship. While fires generally tend to burn upward, especially including hydrogen fires, the enormous radiant heat from the blaze would have quickly <b>spread</b> <b>fire</b> over the entire surface of the airship, thus apparently explaining the downward propagation of the flames. Falling, burning debris would also appear as downward streaks of fire.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>fire</b> <b>spread</b> and catastrophic <b>fires</b> {{involving}} multiple vehicles are key indicators of tunnel fire safety they are not accounted for among the most common QRA methods for tunnels (PIARC 2008).
