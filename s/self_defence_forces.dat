The long-term goal for the group is to train 3,000 recruits; the initial batch is intended to develop in a training cadre in order to continue training Raqqa internal security forces recruits.

30|$|The goal of {{supporting}} Japan against China and North Korea {{also led to}} {{the founding of the}} <b>Self</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Forces</b> (SDF) (Jieitai), which was prevention from the democratic ideals of the constitution and enabled the established conservative elite to fortify their ruling position (Kingston 2010 : 13 – 4). In 1952, the San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed, which ended the occupation period, and Japan regained full authority.|$|E
40|$|At the moment, very {{substantial}} {{reforms in the}} field of security are being undertaken in Japan. “The New National Defence Program Guidelines for 2005 and After”, as well as the “Midterm Defence Program Fiscal Year 2005 - 2009 ” both talk about a thorough restructuring of the <b>Self</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Forces</b> to make them able to respond effectively to new threats, such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, as well as provide a more proactive Japanese policy with various initiatives to improve the international security environment. There is a definite strengthening of the Japanese-US security relation, where Japan is being asked to and is willing to take a bigger role. The declaration by North Korea that they now possess nuclear weapons is considered an imminent threat to Japan. This, in connection with the abduction issue (see below) is played up in Japanese mass media and is being used by certain groups to create changes in Japan’s defence posture. These are changes that the Japanese consider necessary to counter the larger threat in the long term, the rise of China. This paper will start with a short historic overview of the Japanese defence posture since World War II and give a short presentation of the kinds of threats Japan feels it is facing since September 11, 2001, and in the future. Then we will continue with Japanese-North Korean relations, and Japanese-Chinese relations. The recent strengthening of the Japanese-US security cooperation, and its implications for Japanese defence posture, as well as regional cooperation, will be covered. We will conclude with what these changes imply for Europe, as well as the role Europe could play in securing peace and stability in Asia.

25|$|The prologue of {{the film}} {{acknowledges}} {{the events of the}} first Godzilla film (using the present Godzilla monster rather than the 1954 monster), while inventing its own timeline, explaining that the capital of Japan was moved from Tokyo to Osaka.

After this, the G-Graspers, a section of Japanese <b>Self</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Force,</b> was dedicated to fight Godzilla. In 1996, clean plasma energy replaced nuclear energy, but this did not deter Godzilla from attacking.

40|$|The {{question}} of overseas {{deployment of the}} <b>Self</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Force</b> (SDF) continues {{to be one of}} the most controversial issues in Japan’s foreign policy. This becomes particularly obvious with respect to participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Japan is caught between, on the one hand, the aspiration to contribute to international peace and security and, on the other, the need to adhere to the constitution, which renounces the use of force as an instrument of foreign policy. This has led to strict legal limitations concerning Japan’s participation in peacekeeping missions, resulting in significant practical problems in the field. Despite revisions of the legal framework, Japan’s contribution to peacekeeping activities remains severely limited, particularly with respect to so-called robust peacekeeping. Instead of gradually broadening the SDF’s activities, however, Tokyo would be better advised to strengthen its civilian contribution to peace operations...|$|R
