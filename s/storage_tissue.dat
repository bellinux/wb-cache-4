In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue.

5000|$|In {{some groups}} (e.g. grains {{of the family}} Poaceae) the {{endosperm}} persists to the mature seed stage as a <b>storage</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{in which case the}} seeds are called [...] "albuminous" [...] or [...] "endospermous", and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g., most members of the family Fabaceae, including the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris), in which case the seeds are called [...] "exalbuminous" [...] or [...] "cotyledonous" [...] and the function of <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> is performed by enlarged cotyledons ("seed leaves"). In certain species (e.g. corn, Zea mays); the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo. Some mature endosperm tissue stores fats (e.g. castor bean, Ricinus communis) and others (including grains, such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches.|$|E

40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) {{was shown}} {{to be present in}} a range of {{developing}} seeds by measurement of its activity and by immunoblotting. Its function was investigated during grape (Vitis vinifera L.) seed development. The maximum abundance of PEPCK coincided with the deposition of storage reserves. At this stage of development, immunohistochemistry showed that PEPCK was very abundant in a layer of cells located at the boundary of developing <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> and in the chalaza (close to the termination of the vascular supply to the seed) and was also present in the palisade layer of the seed coat (the inner layer of the outer integument). Earlier in development PEPCK was also present in the developing palisade layer and in the inner region of the nucellus which surrounds the developing endosperm. At later stages of development, PEPCK was located in the outer region of the endosperm. However, PEPCK was present in the phloem of the seed at all stages of development. Feeding of asparagine to developing grape seeds led to a strong induction of PEPCK. We suggest that, in developing grape seeds, both the chalaza and palisade tissue may distribute imported assimilates from the vasculature to the developing <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> and that PEPCK {{may play a role in}} the metabolism of nitrogenous assimilates during their delivery from the vasculature to the <b>storage</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of aloin cells is a distinctive {{character of the}} Alooideae. These cells are present in all Alooideae, but are absent {{in most of the}} other genera within Asphodeloideae. A well-developed cap of thin-walled parenchyma cells occurs at the phloem pole of each vascular bundle. Chase posits that they are involved in secondary metabolite production, but Beaumont suggests that the cells act as a <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> for compounds synthesized in the surrounding layer of cells. The aloin cells are said to produce the characteristic thick exudate that is produced when the succulent leaf of aloe is severed. The aloin cells produce anthraquinone and chromone derivatives, which may be responsible for the medicinal attributes of Aloe.|$|E
40|$|Various enzymes of {{glycerol}} metabolism in the extracts of 5 -day-old eastor bean (Ricinus communis L. var. Hale) endosperm and 4 -day-old peanut (Archis hypogaea L.) cotyledon were studied. NAD-glycerol dehydrogenase and NAD-α-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase {{were not}} detected. Glycerol kinase was {{detected in the}} soluble fractions and an α-glycerolphosphate oxidoreductase {{was found in the}} particulate fractions. The particulate fractions were separated into various organelle fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation and the α-glycerolphosphate oxidoreductase was shown to be present in the mitochondria. The properties of the castor bean mitochondrial α-glycerolphosphate oxidoreductase resembled those of a similar enzyme present in the mitochondria of many animal tissues. A survey showed that the α-glycerolphosphate oxidoreductase was present in great amount only in the <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> of fatty seedlings but not in other nonfatty plant tissues. It is concluded that in the <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> of fatty seedlings, the soluble glycerol kinase and the mitochondrial cytochrome-linked α-glycerolphosphate oxidoreductase are the two enzymes responsible for the initial conversion of glycerol to hexose...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed in}} an animal model that iron isotopic composition varies substantially between different organs. For instance, iron in ferritin-rich organs-such {{as the major}} <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> liver, spleen, and bone marrow-contain a larger fraction of the heavy iron isotopes compared with other tissues, including blood. As a consequence, partitioning of body iron into red blood cells and storage compartments should {{be reflected in the}} isotopic pattern of blood iron. To confirm this hypothesis, we monitored blood iron isotope patterns in iron-overloaded subjects undergoing phlebotomy treatment by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We found that bloodletting and consequential replacement of lost blood iron by storage iron led to a substantial increase of the heavy isotope fraction in the blood. The progress of iron depletion therapy and blood loss was quantitatively traceable by isotopic shifts of as much as + 1 ‰ in δ((56) Fe). These results show that-together with iron absorption efficiency-partitioning of iron between blood and iron <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> is an important determinant of blood iron isotopic patterns, which could make blood iron isotopic composition the first composite measure of iron metabolism in humans...|$|R

50|$|Recently, {{some species}} have been {{described}} where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (a bushshrike), described as Laniarius liberatus, in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as {{to the status of}} such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, {{in the case of the}} bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown color morph of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and <b>storage,</b> <b>tissue</b> samples can be just as valuable even in case disputes about the validity of a species arise.|$|E
40|$|Laterally {{connected}} vascular bundles in the nodes of sugarcane (Saccharum species cv. Pindar) stalks allow a rapid {{redistribution of}} water across the stalk should the vascular continuity be partly disrupted. Tritiated water supplied {{to the roots}} exchanged rapidly between the xylem and <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> so that net movement up the stalk was slow. The half-time for exchange in a labeled stalk was about 4 hours so that the entire water content of a sugarcane stalk can turn over {{at least once in}} a single day. No rapid flux of sugar between xylem and phloem or xylem and <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> was detected. Functional xylem contained only low sugar concentrations: less than 0. 3 % w/v in the stalk and less than 0. 02 % w/v in the leaf.

40|$|The rapid {{diversification}} of angiosperms through the Early Cretaceous period, between about 130 - 100 million years ago, initiated {{fundamental changes in}} the composition of terrestrial vegetation and is increasingly well understood {{on the basis of a}} wealth of palaeobotanical discoveries over the past four decades and their integration with improved knowledge of living angiosperms. Prevailing hypotheses, based on evidence both from living and from fossil plants, emphasize that the earliest angiosperms were plants of small stature with rapid life cycles that exploited disturbed habitats in open, or perhaps understorey, conditions. However, direct palaeontogical data relevant to understanding the seed biology and germination ecology of Early Cretaceous angiosperms are sparse. Here we report the discovery of embryos and their associated nutrient <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> in exceptionally well-preserved angiosperm seeds from the Early Cretaceous. Synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy of the fossil embryos from many taxa reveals that all were tiny at the time of dispersal. These results support hypotheses based on extant plants that tiny embryos and seed dormancy are basic for angiosperms as a whole. The minute size of the fossil embryos, and the modest nutrient <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> dictated by the overall small seed size, is also consistent with the interpretation that many early angiosperms were opportunistic, early successional colonizers of disturbance-prone habitats...|$|R

Asymbiotic seed {{germination}} opened up new avenues in rescuing of orchids from their wild population. In the present study, an epiphytic and rare orchid Eria bambusifolia seeds were germinated in two different Knudson (KC) and Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium. Higher germination percentage was noted in MS medium so it was selected for further studies. The MS medium was nourished with different phytohormones and NAA at 2 mg/l was found to enhance shoot and root length. The rooted seedlings were acclimatized successfully...|$|R
40|$|Cereal grains, as <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> of the plant, contain high {{amounts of}} starch. Purification of RNA from plant tissue {{especially}} from seed tissue {{can be challenging}} due to this high starch content. Starch coprecipitates with RNA {{in the presence of}} isopropanol or ethanol and can interfere with the extraction process and downstream reactions. Thus the removal of starch by using appropriate methods is necessary for obtaining pure RNA to be processed for functional genomics analysis. We describe a method to isolate large amount of good-quality RNA from developing and mature wheat grain which can also be adapted to other cereal grains...|$|R

40|$|To {{unravel the}} {{evolutionarily}} conserved genetic network underlying energy homeostasis, {{we performed a}} systematic in vivo gene knockdown screen in Drosophila. We used a transgenic RNAi library enriched for fly orthologs of human genes to functionally impair {{about half of all}} Drosophila genes specifically in adult fat <b>storage</b> <b>tissue.</b> This approach identified 77 genes, which affect the body fat content of the fly, including 58 previously unknown obesity-associated genes. These genes function in diverse biological processes such as lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated trafficking, and the universal store-operated calciumentry (SOCE). Impairment of the SOCE core component Stromal interaction molecule (Stim), as well as other components of the pathway, causes adiposity in flies. Acute Stim dysfunction in the fat <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> triggers hyperphagia via remote control of the orexigenic short neuropeptide F in the brain, which in turn affects the coordinated lipogenic and lipolytic gene regulation, resulting in adipose tissue hypertrophy...|$|E
30|$|Regarding the {{localization}} of starch granules in culm, it can {{be observed}} that most starch granules localized in the parenchyma cells, around nuclei or close to cell walls. As parenchyma cells are the <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> for the plant, abundant starch granules can fill up the cells [16]. Similar trend was also reported in wheat stems that the starch granules are found predominantly in parenchyma cells surrounding the vasculature [1].|$|E
40|$|Dormancy is {{the final}} stage of tuber life serving to {{preserve}} tubers as organs of vegetative reproduction under unfavorable growth conditions. Since the duration of potato tuber dormancy and their sprouting time have significant economic importance, much attention is given {{to the study of the}} regulation of these processes. This review considers metabolite, genetic, and hormonal aspects of regulation of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber dormancy and sprouting. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between processes occurring in different parts of the tuber: its <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> and buds. The interaction of hormonal and metabolite (carbohydrate) regulation of dormancy and sprouting is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Roots {{and stems}} of cotton (Gossypium hir-sutum L.) plants store photoassimilate as starch. Partitioning of fixed carbon between starch in {{vegetative}} <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> and seed {{is likely to}} impact cotton development and yield. The enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGp) plays a rate-limiting role in starch production, and its temporal and spatial expression plays {{a critical role in}} determining patterns of starch deposi-tion in plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify, sequence, and analyze a cotton ADPGp (small subunit) gene involved in starch produc-tion in stems and roots.

5000|$|Glyoxysomes are {{specialized}} peroxisomes {{found in}} plants (particularly in the fat <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> of germinating seeds) {{and also in}} filamentous fungi. Seeds that contain fats and oils include corn, soybean, sunflower, peanut and pumpkin. [...] As in all peroxisomes, in glyoxysomes the fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl-CoA by peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. When the fatty acids are oxidized hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced as oxygen (O2) is consumed. [...] Thus the seeds need oxygen to germinate. Besides peroxisomal functions, glyoxysomes possess additionally the key enzymes of glyoxylate cycle (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) which accomplish the glyoxylate cycle bypass.|$|R

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} (PM) of higher plants contains numerous proteins; however, {{due to their}} low abundance, only a few have been identified and characterized by direct biochemical approaches. The major intrinsic protein (MIP) family is a class of highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins thought to function as channels that facilitate the passage of water, small solutes, and possibly other moieties through the membrane. A family of PM intrinsic proteins was purified and characterized from PM vesicles derived from <b>storage</b> <b>tissue</b> of Beta vulgaris L. using the detergent 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]- 1 -propane sulfonate. This PM intrinsic protein-enriched fraction also contains high levels of UDP-glucose:(1, 3) -beta-glucan (callose) synthase activity. Dithiothreitol is required to visualize the monomeric species of these highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins. Sequence analysis of tryptic fragments derived from polypeptides of 31 and 27 kD revealed significant homologies to plant MIPs identified from cloned sequences. These MIPs include clone 7 a from pea and RD 28 from Arabidopsis, {{both of which are}} water-stress proteins, a tomato ripening-associated membrane protein, and PIP 2 b, a PM-bound water channel protein from Arabidopsis. MIPs, therefore, represent abundantly occurring components of PMs derived from beet <b>storage</b> <b>tissue...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reductions of {{its natural}} populations {{have led to}} recent efforts in {{small-scale}} aquaculture of the freshwater prawn Cryphiops caementarius, either for conservation or commercial purposes. However, the {{lack of knowledge about}} its nutritional requirements {{has been one of the}} major obstacles for its successful culture. Given its importance, this study determines and compares the chemical composition (moisture, ash, crude protein, total lipids and nitrogen free extract) of whole animals and main <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> (gonad, hepatopancreas and muscle), of C. caementarius adult prawns from two natural populations. Moreover, the relation of this composition with reproductive and environmental parameters (sex, maturation and habitat) is discussed. The specimens were collected in Limarí and Choapa rivers (Coquimbo, Chile) during reproductive season, and divided into six categories according to capture location, gonad maturation stage, and gender. The chemical composition of whole animals and <b>storage</b> <b>tissues</b> was compared among categories. Significant differences were observed between tissues, sexes, maturity stages and locations. Regarding tissues, the muscle and the gonads were rich in protein, whereas the hepatopancreas had high lipid content. According to results, factors such as sex, habitat and stage of gonad maturation can modify the biochemistry of C. caementarius. Nonetheless, the main chemical variations were observed in tissues involved in regulatory processes (hepatopancreas and gonads), and to a lesser extent in structural tissues (muscle). This is the first study known that reports information about the biochemistry of C. caementarius and its findings may be useful to improve feeding practices in aquaculture...|$|R

Enzyme activity transferring the L-fucosyl moiety from GDP fucose to membrane-glycoproteins was almost exclusively confined to golgi vesicles. This was demonstrated by comparing highly purified preparations of the ER, golgi and other organelles. The findings in vitro were supplemented by feeding experiments in vivo, establishing vesicles of golgi and plasma membrane as the by far dominating intracellular sites characterizable by fucose-containing glycoproteins.
