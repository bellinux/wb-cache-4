25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to be conservative, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b> This {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E

25|$|To <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{business plan}} estimated {{a profit of}} €4.8bn based on a rise in assets value of 10%. Today's revised figures say that if they recover the full value of the loans plus 10% it {{will result in a}} profit of €3.9bn. NAMA chairman Frank Daly said the plan confirmed that the five institutions covered by NAMA had not disclosed or had been unaware of the extent of the financial crisis afflicting their borrowers. He said the banks had shown 'remarkable generosity' towards their borrowers, adding that NAMA had no intention of maintaining that approach. 'To <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> we are extremely disappointed and disturbed to find that, only months after being led to believe that 40% of loans were income producing, the real figure is actually 25%.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{hosts of}} the day, Trebek made several guest {{appearances}} as a panellist or player on other shows; {{one of his}} guest appearances was on a special week of NBC's Card Sharks, in 1980, where he and several other game show hosts (including Allen Ludden, Bill Cullen, Wink Martindale, Jack Clark, Gene Rayburn, and Jim Lange) competed in a week-long round robin tournament for charity. Trebek won the tournament, defeating Cullen in the finals. Trebek also appeared as a celebrity teammate on the NBC game show The Magnificent Marble Machine in 1975, {{as well as the}} Tom Kennedy-hosted NBC word game To <b>Say</b> <b>the</b> <b>Least</b> in 1978. Both of those shows were produced by Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley Productions, which also produced High Rollers, the show Trebek was hosting during both of those guest appearances. Trebek also was a contestant on Celebrity Bowling in 1976, teamed with Jim McKrell; the duo won their match against Dick Gautier and Scatman Crothers.|$|E

[...] Thomas further stated, [...] "Federal Indian policy, is, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> schizophrenic."

500|$|Frusciante's {{new musical}} {{approach}} met a mixed response from fans and critics. AllMusic's Fred Thomas {{in his review}} of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated: [...] "The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing one to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b> [...] The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context {{for a lot of}} the choices he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{suit was}} brought in the U.S. by New Era Publications in May 1988 that sought to prevent Bare-faced Messiah being distributed, after {{it had already been}} {{published}} and shipped. Prior to publication, New Era offered to buy out the publication rights to Bare-faced Messiah but was rebuffed. Publisher Henry Holt had distributed 12,500 copies by the time New Era obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent shipment of the remaining copies from the first print run. New Era's request for an injunction against the distribution of the existing copies was refused. Henry Holt's president, Bruno Quinson, declared his company's intention to fight the suit: [...] "This is a case, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> that has serious First Amendment considerations and we are vigorously opposing the Scientologists' efforts to prevent the publication of this book." ...|$|E

He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.|$|R

But no one had. Not even when he got halfway down,--on his knees, {{and it would have been}} easier still to knock him down or kick him. People do miss a lot of chances.|$|R

"Vincent Kartheiser [...] had a {{challenging}} year playing Angel’s errant son, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b> While audiences may have {{hoped for a}} reconciliation between the two, it {{was never meant to}} be.

But [...] earns serious kudos for his amazing last inning transformation of Connor from brat to tragic figure worthy of pity and understanding in Peace Out and Home. That Vincent was able to redeem Connor {{in such a short time}} is a true feat in itself and it was singularly responsible for making the finale as heartbreaking and haunting as it ended up being." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Mountain of Madness" [...] finished 38th in {{ratings for the}} week of February 2–9, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.5 million viewing households. It was the second-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following King of the Hill. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an inventive episode, with several memorable moments". Tim Raynor of DVDTown.com said there are some [...] "good, sidesplitting moments to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> for this witty episode". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode [...] "a good show" [...] and praised it for the [...] "snowy setting [...] allows the other characters to expand as well".|$|E
500|$|This {{version of}} events was refuted in 1827 by {{historian}} William James, who wrote in response [...] to Brenton that [...] "All we [...] can say to this extraordinary statement is, that our [...] account was taken chiefly from Bostons log book, {{and we have not}} the least reason, from subsequent inquiries, to believe it to be incorrect." [...] Subsequent histories, including William Laird Clowes' book of 1900 and Richard Woodman's of 2001 follow James, but in his 1837 reprint Brenton defended the account and named Alexander Robert Kerr, second lieutenant of Boston during the action, as his source. In the same year a magazine article written by a niece of Captain Courtenay continued to repeat the allegations, stating that [...] "the treacherous or – to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> of it – the improper and unprofessional conduct of Lieutenant Edwards" [...] had been responsible for his commander's death.|$|E
60|$|The {{meeting of}} these two {{experienced}} seamen was cordial, but not without great seriousness. Both felt that the situation of not only the ship, but of the whole fleet, was extremely critical, the odds being much too great, and {{the position of the}} enemy too favourable, not to render <b>the</b> result, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> very <b>least,</b> exceedingly doubtful. Some advantage had certainly been obtained, thus far; but there was little hope of preserving it long. The circumstances called for very decided and particularly bold measures.|$|R
6000|$|Again, on February 3, 1747, James recurs, {{in a long}} letter, to {{what passed}} in 1742, 'because that is the foundation, and I may <b>say</b> <b>the</b> key, of all that has followed.' Now in 1742 Murray of Broughton paid {{his first visit to}} Rome, and was fascinated by Charles. This unhappy man, {{afterwards}} the Judas of the cause, was unscrupulous in private life in matters of which it is needless to speak more fully. He was, or gave himself the air of being, a very stout Protestant. James employed him, but probably liked him little. It is to be gathered, from James's letter of February 3, 1747, that he suspected Charles of listening to advice, probably from Murray, about his changing his religion. 'You cannot forget how you were prevailed upon to speak to your brother' (the devout Duke of York) 'on very nice and delicate subjects, and that without <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> thing to me, though we lived in the same house [...] . You were then much younger than you are now, and therefore could be more easily led by specious arguments and pretences. [...] . It will, to be sure, have been represented to you that our religion is a great prejudice to our interest, but that it may in some measure be remedied by a certain free way of thinking and acting.' {26b} ...|$|R
5000|$|The Civil Wars {{announced}} that they would permanently part ways on August 5, and offered a free download of [...] "You Are My Sunshine" [...] as a parting gift. Williams wrote: [...] "I am saddened and disappointed by the ending of this duo, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> very <b>least.</b> JP is a tremendous musician, and I will always be grateful for the music {{we were able to}} create together." [...] White's statement read: [...] "I would like to express sincere thanks to all who were a part of the arc of The Civil Wars—from the beginning, to the end, and all points in between." ...|$|R
500|$|Dave Foster of DVD Times said: [...] "Once again {{showing the}} mischievous {{relationship}} Bart and Homer share their pranks {{and the inevitable}} confrontations with George Bush Senior are as hilarious as they are implausible and frequent, but {{there is much to}} love about this episode in which the writers think out loud and paint The Simpsons and its characters as Bush once did." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it [...] "offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> and it could– and probably should– have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show." [...] John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.|$|E
500|$|Caesar's niece, Atia, {{was portrayed}} by actress Polly Walker. According to Heller, while most auditioning actresses {{assumed that the}} {{character}} was the series' villainess, Walker made [...] " [...] bigger than life but completely real...She could read the phone book {{with that kind of}} brio and joy." [...] Rather than a villain, Heller wrote her to be [...] "a real life force. Everything she's doing is for the good of her family, her children. No matter how evil it gets, it's always for good reason." [...] Walker was pleased with her [...] "very complex character. I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> situations. I saw it as a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character. A lot of people might consider her to be sort of evil or bad, but I think she's wonderful. She's just a survivor, doing what she's got to do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Show" [...] was {{described}} by BBC Music as [...] "a feisty, thumping track with a positively rude bassline," [...] while a reviewer for Virgin Media described the song as a [...] "rush of thrilling synth stabs and natty vocal hooks." [...] Paul Scott of Stylus Magazine referred to [...] "The Show" [...] as one of Girls Aloud's best songs, deeming it [...] "audacious to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b> With its clipped delivery and gnarled synth riffs barely sweetened, it’s SAW doing SST; tungsten and gristle polished to an FM sheen." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian considered [...] "The Show" [...] and [...] "Love Machine" [...] as the perfect examples of Xenomania's unique production, and added that the lead single [...] "is based around a frantically exciting electronic noise {{that seems to have}} escaped from an early-1990s rave record." [...] In their best-of-year countdown, The Times noted that the song helped Xenomania to establish themselves as the best pop music production team.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the {{auxiliary}} game is determined. Proof: By transfinite induction, for each ordinal α compute {{the set of}} positions where player 1 can force a win in α steps, where a position with player 2 to move is losing (for player 2) in α steps iff for every move the resulting position is losing in less than α steps. One strategy for player 1 is to reduce α with each position (<b>say</b> picking <b>the</b> <b>least</b> α and breaking ties by picking <b>the</b> <b>least</b> move), and one strategy for player 2 is to pick <b>the</b> <b>least</b> (actually any would work) move that {{does not lead to}} a position with an α assigned.

25|$|The late season run {{also was}} very {{beneficial}} to the team's bottom line, the team started the year with only 123 season-ticket holders were on track to lose $500,000 that season, they managed to lessen that to $300,000. Their average attendance was 7,200, but that number was largely made up of complementary tickets. Their late season run though included three consecutive 9,000+ crowds of which all were paid tickets, and thus ownership was highly optimistic heading into their second season. As it turns out, this was actually the club's most successful season financially, that is to <b>say</b> it's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> money they lost in one season.|$|R
