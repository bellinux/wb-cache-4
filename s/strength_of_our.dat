This is a non-partisan, permitted and peaceful event where we march in solidarity with our partners and children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families — recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country. Oregon and Greater Portland NOW and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette are two of our several sponsors and allies.|$|E
500|$|Romm {{has been}} {{critical}} of media coverage of global warming. [...] In his 2010 book, Straight Up, he wrote, [...] "Historically, even the most respected newspapers have fallen {{into the trap of}} giving the same credence – and often the same amount of space – to a handful of U.S. scientists, most receiving funds from the fossil fuel industry, as they give to hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists. [...] No surprise that much of the public has ended up with a misimpression about the remarkable <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> scientific understanding and the need for action". [...] He concludes, [...] "more and more pieces are being written by senior political reporters, who know very little about global warming". Romm also believes that scientists and politicians need to be more effective communicators about climate change.|$|E
500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for the sake of our unity as a people and the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> democracy, I offer my concession." ...|$|E

2500|$|By February 1942 Japanese {{forces had}} gained footholds in territories {{adjoining}} northern Australia {{which made it}} seem probable that the advance southwards would continue, culminating in the invasion of Australia.

We lacked air support, possessing no fighters whatsoever, and our bomber and reconnaissance planes had been reduced to about 50 machines.

2500|$|Also in 1992, the New York museum building's {{exhibition}} and other space was expanded {{by the addition}} of an adjoining rectangular tower, taller than the original spiral, and a renovation of the original building. [...] The same year, the foundation opened a small Guggenheim Museum SoHo in the SoHo neighborhood of downtown Manhattan. This space was kept after the main museum was re-opened, but it closed in 2002 due to an economic downturn. [...] To finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani to raise $47 million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for [...] "trendy" [...] latecomers. In The New York Times, critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales [...] "stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do." [...] Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its [...] "postwar collection to the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> pre-war holdings" [...] and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.|$|E
2500|$|A fierce {{opponent}} of xenophobia, he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This {{clashed with the}} Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia's [...] "special place" [...] in the world. [...] " [...] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [...] above the West just on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being Orthodox," [...] Tolstoy wrote in a letter. All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia's potential guiding light. [...] "What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity," [...] Tolstoy argued. Being neither a westernizer nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on {{the cult of the}} nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy's critique of the West's amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile Moscovia State being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic [...] "political romanticism" [...] appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 July 1934, the Cabinet {{approved}} {{a report that}} called for expansion of the Royal Air Force to the 1923 standard by creating 40 new squadrons over the following five years. On 26 November 1934, six days after receiving {{the news that the}} German air force would be as large as the RAF within one year, the Cabinet decided to speed up air rearmament from four years to two. On 28 November 1934 Churchill moved an amendment to the vote of thanks for the King's Speech, which read: [...] "...the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> national defences, and especially our air defences, is no longer adequate". His motion was known eight days before it was moved, and a special Cabinet meeting decided how to deal with this motion; it dominated two other Cabinet meetings. Churchill said Germany was rearming; he requested that the money spent on air armaments be doubled or tripled in order to deter an attack; and that the Luftwaffe was nearing equality with the RAF. Baldwin responded by denying that the Luftwaffe was approaching equality and said it was [...] "not 50 per cent" [...] of the RAF. He added {{that by the end of}} 1935 the RAF would still have [...] "a margin of nearly 50 per cent" [...] in Europe. After Baldwin said the government would ensure the RAF had parity with the future German air force Churchill withdrew his amendment. In April 1935 the Air Secretary reported that although Britain's strength in the air would be ahead of Germany's for at least three years, air rearmament needed to be increased; so the Cabinet agreed to the creation of an extra 39 squadrons for home defence by 1937. However, on 8 May 1935 the Cabinet heard that it was estimated that the RAF was inferior to the Luftwaffe by 370 aircraft and that in order to reach parity the RAF must have 3,800 aircraft by April 1937—an extra 1,400 above the existing air programme. It was learnt that Germany was easily able to outbuild this revised programme as well. On 21 May 1935, the Cabinet agreed to expanding the home defence force of the RAF to 1,512 aircraft (840 bombers and 420 fighters). On 22 May 1935 Baldwin confessed in the Commons: [...] "I was wrong in my estimate of the future. There I was completely wrong." ...|$|E
