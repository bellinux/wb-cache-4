40|$|Rationale Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS), using lambda-cyhalothrin, was piloted in Malawi in 2007 by the Presidents Malaria Initiative (PMI) in Nkhota-kota district. The Ministry of Health scaled up IRS to six additional districts across Malawi including Chikhwawa, in 2011. This {{study was}} designed {{to assess the impact of}} IRS against a background of high malaria prevalence and possible insecticide resistance on the major malaria vectors of Malawi, Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus in Chikhwawa; and to measure the impact of IRS on entomological indices and malaria prevalence in children of under 5 years of age. Methodology Three <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> (Mwingama, Namila and Tsekera) were established in Chikhwawa and 6 window exit traps installed at each site. IRS was conducted in February 2011. Mosquitoes were captured daily, from October 2010 to April 2012, and analysed for species abundance and sporozoites. Separate mosquito collections were carried out using standard WHO insecticide susceptibility assays on An. gambiae and An. funestus from the <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites.</b> Insecticide quantification of IRS was determined by colorimetric analysis of the wall pads placed on selected houses within the <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites.</b> Anaemia and parasitaemia were determined in children of less than 5 years old from a 50 villages catchment area including the three <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites,</b> through rolling malaria indicator surveys (rMIS). Results and Conclusion The study has shown large heterogeneity in mosquito abundance between <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites.</b> Suspected cross resistance found was found in both An. gambiae and An. funestus to carbamates, organophosphates and pyrethroids suggesting a metabolic based resistance mechanism. Clear resistance (77 % mortality) was only found at Namila to deltamethrin in An. funestus. There was significant change in resistance pattern at Namila in An. funestus to lambda-cyhalothrin between 2011 and 2012 (X 2 = 6. 011, p = 0. 014). No statistically significant change was observed in An. gambiae and An. funestus abundance differences pre-post IRS suggesting programmatic IRS challenges in Chikhwawa. There was a decline on parasitaemia prevalence from an average of 41 % to 29 % post IRS. While entomological surveillance is important for the vector control programme in Malawi, there is a need to utilise this data to improve the actual IRS activities, especially when combined with the results of malaria burden as seen here...|$|R

Deciding on the number, geographic location and hospitals to be selected as sentinel sites was a challenge. Based on the recently published WHO guideline for influenza surveillance (2012), this study presents the process for hospital <b>sentinel</b> <b>site</b> selection. MethodsFrom the 2, 165 hospitals in Indonesia, {{the first step was}} to shortlist to hospitals that had previously participated in respiratory disease surveillance systems and had acceptable surveillance performance history. The second step involved categorizing the shortlist according to five regions in Indonesia to maximize geographic representativeness. A checklist was developed based on the WHO recommended attributes for <b>sentinel</b> <b>site</b> selection including stability, feasibility, representativeness and the availability of data to enable disease burden estimation. Eight hospitals, a maximum of two per geographic region, were visited for checklist administration. Checklist findings from the eight hospitals were analyzed and sentinel sites selected in the third step. ResultsSix hospitals could be selected based on resources available to ensure system stability over a three-year period. For feasibility, all eight hospitals visited had mechanisms for specimen shipment and the capacity to report surveillance data, but two had limited motivation for system participation. For representativeness, the eight hospitals were geographically dispersed around Indonesia, and all could capture cases in all age and socio-economic groups. All eight hospitals had prerequisite population data to enable disease burden estimation. The two hospitals with low motivation were excluded and the remaining six were selected as sentinel sites.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{impact of}} malaria control {{programs}} {{has been widely}} investigated in recent years following the implementation of multifaceted control programs in many low-income countries. Some clinical studies show few signs of decreasing malaria incidence after the distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs), the adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), and other malaria case-management strategies. In Madagascar, routine data collection has shown inconsistent results of malaria control interventions in some regions, such as the region of Betsiboka in northwest Madagascar, where different data sources show increasing and decreasing trends in malaria incidence {{less than two years}} after the first distribution of LLINs and the introduction of ACT and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). In this study, hypotheses regarding the trends seen in the Health Management Information System (HMIS) and <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Site</b> data sources from a large clinic in the Betsiboka region, the CSBU in Maevatanana district, were evaluated using triangulation methodology. This study showed that the main reason for decreasing malaria trends seen in the HMIS data was the change in case definition for malaria after the introduction of RDTs. For the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Site</b> data source, increases in the number of RDT+ malaria cases as well as the percentage of RDT+ malaria cases of all patient consults at the CSBU contradict what was expected after the implementation of malaria control interventions in 2007. The effects of malaria control interventions may be attenuated by changes in human behavior, such as increased fever consults at the CSBU and the improved capture ability of RDTs. However, increases in the proportion of malaria cases of all patient consults at the CSBU may suggest a true increase in malaria incidence. Furthermore, increases in reported malaria cases in the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Site</b> data also corresponds to increases in ACT stock-out in Maevatanana, ambient temperature, as well as the presence of resistance to pyrethroids and quinolines. By collecting and comparing different data sources of different measurements, this study was able to make conclusions about the decreasing malaria trends in the HMIS data. However, the study showed inconclusive results regarding the increasing trends seen in the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Site</b> data, and further investigation is needed...|$|E

Annual MDA with ivermectin {{had been given}} for 17 years, 8 of which were in combination with albendazole. In 2008, assessments indicated that LF transmission was interrupted, but that the MDA had to continue due to the uncertain status of onchocerciasis transmission. Accordingly, assessments to determine if ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis could be stopped were conducted in 2009. We evaluated nodule, microfilarial (mf) skin snip, and antibody (IgG 4 response to OV 16) prevalence in adults and children in six <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> where baseline data from the 1990 s were available. We applied the 2001 WHO criteria for elimination of onchocerciasis that defined transmission interruption as an infection rate of < 0. 1 % in children (using both skin snip and OV 16 antibody) and a rate of infective (L 3) blackflies of < 0. 05 %. Among adult residents in <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites,</b> mean mf prevalence decreased by 99. 37 % from the 1991 - 1993 baseline of 42. 95 % (64 / 149) to 0. 27 % (2 / 739) in 2009 (p< 0. 001). The OV 16 seropositivity of 3. 52 % (26 / 739) among this same group was over ten times the mf rate. No mf or nodules were detected in 4, 451 children in <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> and 'spot check' villages, allowing the exclusion of 0. 1 % infection rate with 95 % confidence.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{expansion}} of national schistosomiasis control programmes in Africa based on large-scale preventative chemotherapy. In many areas this has resulted in considerable reductions in infection and morbidity levels in treated individuals. In this paper, we quantify changes in the force of infection (FOI), defined here as the per (human) host parasite establishment rate, to ascertain the impact on transmission {{of some of these}} programmes under the umbrella of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). A previous model for the transmission dynamics of Schistosoma mansoni was adapted here to S. haematobium. These models were fitted to longitudinal cohort (infection intensity) monitoring and evaluation data. Changes in the FOI following up to three annual rounds of praziquantel were estimated for Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) according to country, baseline endemicity and schistosome species. Since schistosomiasis transmission is known to be highly focal, changes in the FOI at a finer geographical scale (that of <b>sentinel</b> <b>site)</b> were also estimated for S. mansoni in Uganda. Substantial and statistically significant reductions in the FOI relative to baseline were recorded in the majority of, but not all, combinations of country, parasite species, and endemicity areas. At the finer geographical scale assessed within Uganda, marked heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of the relative changes in FOI was observed {{that would not have been}} appreciated by a coarser-scale analysis. Reductions in the rate at which humans acquire schistosomes have been achieved in many areas of SSA countries assisted by the SCI, while challenges in effectively reducing transmission persist in others. Understanding the underlying heterogeneity in the impact and performance of the control intervention at the level of the transmission site will become increasingly important for programmes transitioning from morbidity reduction to elimination of infection. Such analyses will require a fine-scale approach. The lack of association found between programmatic variables, such as therapeutic treatment coverage (recorded at district level) and changes in FOI (at <b>sentinel</b> <b>site</b> level) is discussed and recommendations are made...|$|E

Between 2004 and 2012, five {{rounds of}} mass drug {{administration}} (MDA) of praziquantel has been rolled {{out for the}} control of schistosomiasis in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the effect of MDA of praziquantel on the prevalence and intensity of infection of schistosomiasis in Burkina. METHODS. A longitudinal survey was conducted from 2008 to 2013 at 22 <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> across Burkina in order to estimate the presence of Schistosoma haematobium infection. In addition, in 2013, a cross sectional study of S. haematobium and S. mansoni in school children aged 7 to 11 years was conducted in the same sites. Standardised diagnostic techniques were used to analyse stool (Kato Katz) and urine (filtration) samples for the presence and number of S. mansoni and S. haematobium eggs, respectively. RESULTS. The findings from the longitudinal survey show a reduction in the median prevalence of S. haematobium from 16 % to 3 %. The cross-sectional survey shows that 13 of 22 <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> still had a prevalence of schistosomiasis > 1 %, with a prevalence of 56 % at the highest. The prevalence of schistosomiasis was higher among boys and older children. CONCLUSIONS. The impact evaluation of five years of MDA of praziquantel in Burkina Faso from 2004 to 2012 suggests that treatment has had a significant impact on reducing the prevalence of schistosomiasis. However, the prevalence of schistosomiasis still remains high in a third of the <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> and, in line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, increased frequency of drug distributions, alongside health education and improvement of sanitation and access to improved water sources, is needed.

Identifying the emergence of AMR requires strengthening of surveillance for AMR, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of infection is highest and health systems are least able to respond. This work aimed, {{through a combination of}} desk-based investigation, discussion with colleagues worldwide, and visits to three contrasting countries (Ethiopia, Malawi and Vietnam), to map and compare existing models and surveillance systems for AMR, to examine what worked and what did not work. Current capacity for AMR surveillance varies in LMICs, but and systems in development are focussed on laboratory surveillance. This approach limits understanding of AMR {{and the extent to which}} laboratory results can inform local, national and international public health policy. An integrated model, combining clinical, laboratory and demographic surveillance in <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> is more informative and costs for clinical and demographic surveillance are proportionally much lower. The speed and extent to which AMR surveillance can be strengthened depends on the functioning of the health system, and the resources available. Where there is existing laboratory capacity, it may be possible to develop 5 - 20 <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> with a long term view of establishing comprehensive surveillance; but where health systems are weaker and laboratory infrastructure less developed, available expertise and resources may limit this to 1 - 2 <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites.</b> Prioritising core functions, such as automated blood cultures, reduces investment at each site. Expertise to support AMR surveillance in LMICs may come from a variety of international, or national, institutions. It is important that these organisations collaborate to support the health systems on which AMR surveillance is built, as well as improving technical capacity specifically relating to AMR surveillance. Strong collaborations, and leadership, drive successful AMR surveillance systems across countries and contexts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Assessing the {{interruption}} of lymphatic filariasis transmission after annual mass drug administration (MDA) requires {{a better understanding}} of how to interpret results obtained with the available diagnostic tools. We conducted parasitologic, serologic, and entomologic surveys in three villages in American Samoa after <b>sentinel</b> <b>site</b> surveys suggested filarial antigen prevalence was < 1 % after five annual MDAs with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole. Antigen and antifilarial antibody prevalence ranged from 3. 7 % to 4. 6 % and from 12. 5 % to 14. 9 %, respectively, by village. Only one person was microfilaria positive. Although no children less than 10 years of age were antigen positive, antifilarial antibody prevalence in this age group was 5. 1 % and antibody-positive children were detected in all three villages. Wuchereria bancrofti–infected mosquitoes were also detected in all three villages. Thus, monitoring of infections in mosquitoes and antifilarial antibody levels in children may serve as indicators of local transmission and be useful for making decisions about program endpoints...|$|E
40|$|The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease/World Health Organization Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance {{recently}} released the fourth global survey, which documents the highest burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) yet reported. The best {{estimate of the}} number of new cases of multidrug-resistant disease occurring in 2006 is close to half a million and the recent recognition of extensively drug-resistant TB underscores the need for expanded surveillance, especially in areas in which TB control programs have been compromised by an escalating burden of TB and HIV. We review current methods used for drug resistance surveillance and describe methodologic obstacles for estimating the true extent of the problem, particularly in settings where HIV/TB coinfection is common or where a substantial portion of TB cases are treated in the private sector. We highlight practical challenges to the validity of surveillance studies and discuss how additional investment in laboratory capacity, diagnostic technologies, and <b>sentinel</b> <b>site</b> surveillance can improve our ability to estimate of the burden of drug-resistant TB...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sentinel</b> <b>sites,</b> where {{problems}} can be identified early or investigated in detail, form {{an important part of}} planning for exotic disease outbreaks in humans, livestock and plants. Key questions are: how many sentinels are required, where should they be positioned and how effective are they at rapidly identifying new invasions? The sentinel apiary system for invasive honeybee pests and diseases illustrates {{the costs and benefits of}} such approaches. Here, we address these issues with two mathematical modelling approaches. The first approach is generic and uses probabilistic arguments to calculate the average number of affected sites when an outbreak is first detected, providing rapid and general insights that we have applied to a range of infectious diseases. The second approach uses a computationally intensive, stochastic, spatial model to simulate multiple outbreaks and to determine appropriate sentinel locations for UK apiaries. Both models quantify the anticipated increase in success of <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> as their number increases and as non-sentinel sites become worse at detection; however, unexpectedly sentinels perform relatively better for faster growing outbreaks. Additionally, the spatial model allows us to quantify the substantial role that carefully positioned sentinels can play in the rapid detection of exotic invasions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Insecticide {{resistance}} in malaria vectors {{is a growing}} concern in many countries which requires immediate attention because of the limited chemical arsenal available for vector control. The current extent and distribution of this {{resistance in}} many parts of the continent is unknown and yet such information is essential for the planning of effective malaria control interventions. Methods In 2008, a network was established, with financial support from WHO/TDR, to investigate the extent of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in five African countries. Here, the results of bioassays on Anopheles gambiae sensu lato from two rounds of monitoring from 12 <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> in three of the partner countries are reported. Results Resistance is very heterogeneous even over relatively small distances. Furthermore, in some sites, large differences in mortality rates were observed during the course of the malaria transmission season. Using WHO diagnostic doses, all populations from Burkina Faso and Chad and two of the four populations from Sudan were classified as resistant to permethrin and/or deltamethrin. Very high frequencies of DDT resistance were found in urban areas in Burkina Faso and Sudan and in a cotton-growing district in Chad. In areas where both An. gambiae s. s. and Anopheles arabiensis were present, resistance was found in both species, although generally at a higher frequency in An gambiae s. s. Anopheles gambiae s. l. remains largely susceptible to the organophosphate fenitrothion and the carbamate bendiocarb in the majority of the <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> with the exception of two sites in Burkina Faso. In the cotton-growing region of Soumousso in Burkina Faso, the vector population is resistant to all four classes of insecticide available for malaria control. Conclusions Possible factors influencing the frequency of resistant individuals observed in the <b>sentinel</b> <b>sites</b> are discussed. The results of this study highlight the importance of standardized longitudinal insecticide resistance monitoring and the urgent need for studies to monitor the impact of this resistance on malaria vector control activities. </p...|$|R
