25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by <b>scarifying</b> them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the University of Agriculture, Makurdi, to determine water uptake at 6 and 12 hour intervals, and germination characteristics of <b>scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds of castor bean accessions in 2008 and 2009. Two hundred seeds were selected from each accession: one hundred seeds were <b>scarified</b> mechanically by caruncle removal using knife (seed lot 1), one hundred seeds were not <b>scarified</b> (seed lot 2). Each seed lot was immersed in 10 ml of distilled water contained in 9 cm-diameter petridish. Thereafter, seed lots were weighed at every 6 h starting from 0 to 24 h, and at every 12 h up to 108 h. Water uptake in <b>scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds was determined by seed mass increase, and expressed as percentage increase in mass of seeds. Germination test of two hundred seeds of each accession was done by planting seeds 2 cm deep in moist sandy loam soil contained in plastic containers to determine germination characteristics. Results showed that the weight and percentage weight increase of seeds at 6 and 12 hour intervals were significantly higher in <b>scarified</b> seeds than in non <b>scarified</b> seeds. <b>Scarified</b> seeds attained maximum saturation at 60 h and non <b>scarified</b> seeds at 84 h. <b>Scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds differed significantly in water uptake and germination characteristics at 6 and 12 hour intervals, being higher in <b>scarified</b> seeds. Mechanical scarification improved water uptake, germination characteristics and the planting value of seeds.

40|$|Small-scale soil {{scarification}} under canopies {{has been}} proposed to remove regeneration inhibitor plants that often dominate the understory in natural forests after selection logging. We studied the impacts of the small-scale soil scarification on carabid beetle assemblages in conifer hardwood mixed forests in northern Japan. We sampled carabid beetles using pitfall traps in <b>scarified</b> sites and adjacent unscarified sites two and four years after scarification. Forest species made up 98 % of the total catch {{with only a few}} individuals of non-forest species occurring in <b>scarified</b> sites. Species richness of forest species did not differ significantly between <b>scarified</b> and unscarified sites, whereas species richness of non-forest species was higher in <b>scarified</b> sites than in unscarified sites. Carabid species composition differed between <b>scarified</b> and unscarified sites in each of the two study years. Dissimilarity measures between <b>scarified</b> and adjacent unscarified sites were smaller after four years than after two years, indicating that differences in species composition associated with scarification declined during the study period. Some forest species were more abundant in <b>scarified</b> sites, whereas other forest species were more abundant in unscarified sites. Our results suggest that small-scale scarification may have a limited impact on carabid beetle diversity...|$|R

40|$|G. Don (Cucurbitaceae) is {{an annual}} weed that disperses dormant seeds.

40|$|Water uptake {{kinetics}} of axes and cotyledons of Vigna radiata seeds {{has been}} studied during incubation at chilling temperature (4 °C) and under cycloheximide treatment. Germination rate of <b>scarified</b> seeds was faster than intact seeds, which can be correlated with their comparative water uptake kinetics. Chilling temperature during incubation significantly slowed down water uptake by both intact and <b>scarified</b> seeds. Treatment with cycloheximide was also somewhat effective in retarding water uptake, but only in <b>scarified</b> seeds. Water uptake by axes isolated from intact seeds (attached or detached from the cotyledons) was inhibited completely by chilling temperature {{as well as by}} cycloheximide treatment while these treatments were ineffective in preventing water uptake by cotyledons. In the case of <b>scarified</b> seeds, such treatments again inhibited water uptake by axes only, the effect being more prominent in attached ones.

With the other hand--the right--he reached into her hair, caught the repulsive abomination as near as he was able by the nape of the neck, and held it tightly between thumb and forefinger as he withdrew it from her hair. It was as horrible and heroic a sight as man could wish to see. It made my flesh crawl.

6000|$|In {{the regions}} we call Nature, towering beyond all measurement, with {{infinite}} spread, infinite depth and height--in those regions, including Man, socially and historically, with his moral-emotional influences--how small a part, (it came {{in my mind}} to-day,) has literature really depicted--even summing up all of it, all ages.

6000|$|On {{the eighth}} and ninth of December, {{he made his}} will, by which he bequeathed the chief of his {{property}} to Francis Barber, his negro servant. The value of this legacy is estimated by Sir John Hawkins, at near £1500. From this time he languished on till the twelfth. That night his bodily uneasiness increased; his attendants assisted him every hour to raise himself in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; each time he prayed fervently; the only support he took was cyder and water. He said he was prepared, but the time to his dissolution seemed long. At {{six in the morning}} he inquired the hour; and, being told, observed that all went on regularly, and that he had but a few hours to live. In two hours after, he ordered his servant to bring him a drawer, out of which he chose one lancet, from amongst some others, and pierced his legs; and then seizing a pair of scissars that lay near him, plunged them into both his calves, no doubt with the hopes of easing them of the water; for he had often reproached his medical attendants with want of courage in not <b>scarifying</b> them more deeply. At ten he dismissed Mr. Windham's servant, who {{was one of those who}} had sat up with him, thanking him, and desiring him to bear his remembrance to his master. Afterwards a Miss Morris, the daughter of one of his friends, came into the room to beg his blessing; of which, being informed by his servant Francis, he turned round in his bed, and said to her, [...] "God bless you, my dear." [...] About seven in the evening he expired so quietly, that those about him did not perceive his departure. His body being opened, two of the valves of the aorta were found to be ossified; the air cells of the lungs unusually distended; one of the kidneys consumed, and the liver schirrous.

50|$|Thatch is a {{build-up}} {{of organic}} matter which can include dead grass, leaves, stems, stolons, rhizomes and overcrowded grass roots and lateral weed growth. Thatch can stifle the growth and health of grass or turf. Removing the thatch helps the grass by encouraging it to thicken up and also makes it stronger and less susceptible to disease. Reducing thatch levels increases the levels of water, air and nutrients that can get through to the root zone of the grass plants. Significant thatch problems in lawns can cause diseases and can encourage moss {{to grow in the}} areas where grass has died. A by-product of <b>scarifying</b> or de-thatching is that moss is also removed, and depending on how deep the <b>scarifying</b> blades are set, root cutting can also occur, and this in turn helps grass to thicken up over time. <b>Scarifying</b> is normally carried out in autumn or spring. When <b>scarifying</b> or de-thatching, not all thatch should be removed as a small amount of thatch is beneficial to the lawn. A lawn that has excessive thatch may feel spongy when trod upon.

40|$|Mimosa bimucronota is a {{pioneering}} tree that occurs predominantly in moist lowlands, floodplains and on margins of {{rivers and lakes}} in Latin America. the effect of submergence on seed germination in M. bimucronata was firstly studied. Patterns of water absorption by M. bimucronata seeds were investigated thereafter to assess the imbibition phases of <b>scarified</b> and unscarified seeds. the germination percentage was significantly higher in <b>scarified</b> than in unscarified seeds, and the velocity of seed germination also increased considerably in <b>scarified</b> seeds. Submergence duration did not significantly affect germination percentages of <b>scarified</b> and unscarified seeds. Therefore, seed viability after submersion suggests that M. bimucronata may display hydrochorous dispersal and also that seeds are able to germinate successfully in areas with frequent seasonal flooding. With respect to imbibition phases, phase II was very short or even absent for <b>scarified</b> and unscarified seeds; therefore, a plateau, where water absorption by seeds is established, was not observed. Finally, we verified that the passage from phase I to III was very tenuous {{and took a long}} time in seeds without scarification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
