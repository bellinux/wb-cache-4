Durability of finish and physical properties of selected combinations having excellent soil release performance were also evaluated. Both Oleophobol CPR and CMC-Na finished cotton resulted in excellent soil release rating at various combinations for mustard oil but both showed poor soil release for coffee. Oleophobol CPR also exhibited <b>soil</b> <b>repellent</b> property and required high curing temperature for crosslinking with cotton. It didn’t impart stiffness to the cotton as compared to that with CMC-Na salt finish. Oleophobol CPR showed much better tensile strength retention as compared to that with CMC-NA salt. Both finishes showed better tear strength retention of cotton. TCRA was slightly improved with Oleophobol CPR. Whiteness index was comparatively better in CMC-Na salt finished cotton. Air permeability in both cases was slightly decreased. Durability tests showed that Oleophobol CPR maintained its soil release and repellent properties with multiple (five) soiling tests and had better soil release rating as compared to that with CMC-Na salt.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} soil water repellency (SWR) on soil hydrophysical properties with depth. Soils were sampled from two distinctly wettable and water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> profiles at depth increments from 0 - 60 cm. The soils were selected because they appeared to either wet readily (wettable) or remain dry (water repellent) under field conditions. Basic soil properties (MWD, SOM, θv) were compared to hydrophysical properties (Ks, Sw, Se, Sww, Swh, WDPT, RIc, RIm and WRCT) that characterise or are affected by water repellency. Our results showed both soil and depth affected basic and hydrophysical properties of the soils (p < 0. 001). Soil organic matter (SOM) was the major property responsible for water repellency at the selected depths (0 - 60). Water repellency changes affected moisture distribution and resulted in the upper layer (0 - 40 cm) of the <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> to be considerably drier compared to the wettable <b>soil.</b> The water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> also had greater MWDdry and Ks over the entire 0 - 60 cm depth compared to the wettable soil. Various measures of sorptivity, Sw, Se, Sww, Swh, were greater through the wettable than water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> profile, which was also reflected in field and dry WDPT measurements. However, the wettable soil had subcritical water repellency, so the range of data {{was used to compare}} indices of water repellency. WRCT and RIm had less variation compared to WDPT and RIc. Estimating water repellency using WRCT and RIm indicated that these indices can detect the degree of SWR and are able to better classify SWR degree of the subcritical-repellent soil from the wettable soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A water- <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> impacts the infiltra-tion {{process in}} a manner similar to a hardpan layer that restricts water {{movement}} into and through the soil. Infiltration of water into a water- <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> is inhibited and often completely impeded in which case the precipitation reaching the soil sur-face becomes overland flow. One cause of water-repellent soils is the distillation of organic corn-pounds in the litter during combustion in a fire (DeBano 1981, 1999, 2003; Doerr et al. 2000). This mechanism resulted in extensive water repellency in the Stermer Ridge watersheds after the Rodeo-Chediski wildfire of 2002.

During the last decades, {{it has been a}} topic of study for soil scientists and hydrologists in at least 21 States of the USA, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Congo, Nepal, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, Mali, Japan, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, South Africa, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Slovakia, Russia, France, Italy, and Greece. Although, water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> already have been indicated {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, they have been discovered and studied in most countries in the last decades. Water repellency is most common in sandy soils with grass cover and in nature reserves, but has also been observed in loam, heavy clay, peat, and volcanic ash soils. From 1940 to 1970 research was focussed on identifying vegetation types responsible for inducing {{water repellency}} and on developing techniques to quantify the degree of water repellency. Of special interest has been the effects of wildfire on the development of soil water repellency and its consequences for soil erosion. Due to increasing concern over the threat to surface and groundwater posed by the use of agrichemicals and organic fertilisers, studies on water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> have also been focused on its typical flow behavior with runoff and the existence of preferential flow paths.

40|$|Water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> have thin {{layers of}} {{hydrophobic}} organic matter on {{the surfaces of}} soil particles. The hydrophobic organic matter makes these soils difficult to wet in opening rains after dry periods. This can cause losses of crop and pasture production and encourage land degradation by wind and water erosion. Wetting patterns in water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> are irregular and incomplete, and no successful model of heat and water movement in water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> has been reported. Furrow sowing improves crop production on water <b>repellent</b> sandy <b>soils.</b> Seeding machinery forms ridges and furrows. Rain is easily shed from dry ridges and runoff accumulates in the furrow (water harvesting). Ponded water infiltrates easily into the soil around the seed. The water movement in furrow-sawn water <b>repellent</b> sandy <b>soils</b> is more regular. This regularity {{makes it possible to}} develop a model. A numerical model of heat and water movement in furrow-sown water repellent sand was developed and validated to help optimize the design of furrow sowing. The model used aerodynamic resistance, soil surface moisture and temperature, and surface evaporative resistance to estimate evaporation from each surface element. Wind speed and radiation was varied by calculation, according to the direction of the Sun or wind to the ridge direction and height. Movement of water and heat in the soil was determined by the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and coupled functions for heat and water movement, as used in many other models. Water repellency effects on drying were included by including the appropriate moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics. Application of the finite element method to a two-dimensional cross section of a ridge and furrow system allows water to be excluded from a soil region beneath a ridge. Field experiments were used to estimate surface evaporative resistance characteristics and to validate the model. The model has been successfully used to suggest optimized designs for ridge and furrow systems to minimize high soil temperatures and evaporation in Western Australia...|$|R
30|$|Effects of fire on {{the ground}} surface with erosion-related {{implications}} include an increase in exposed soil and ash {{and a decrease in}} protective ground cover such as litter and duff. Post-fire organic ground cover, whether charred or uncharred, can provide protection against soil erosion (Ice et al. 2004, Kokaly et al. 2007). Conversely, areas with exposed mineral soil or ash cover increase the risk for erosion by wind and water (DeBano 2000, Robichaud 2000, Ravi et al. 2006). Ash cover is indicative of complete organic material combustion. Because a water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> layer may be formed when these organic materials burn on the soil surface, reduced infiltration is often found where post-fire ash cover is high (DeBano 2000, Lewis et al. 2006). In such cases, the top 1 cm to 5 cm of the soil profile above the water repellent layer may hold water, but once this layer becomes saturated, as often occurs following intense rainfall, erosion is likely, particularly on steep slopes with loose, coarse textured soils. Additionally, these fire-induced water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> conditions occur when waxy chemicals from plant materials are volatilized during burning and coat coarse textured soil particles at or near the soil surface, which is common in chaparral communities (Barro and Conard 1991, CDF 2003, Hubbert et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Leaching {{risks of}} surface-applied agrichemicals in water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> {{can only be}} {{quantified}} with an acceptable degree of accuracy if knowledge of the underlying principles and an appropriate simulation model are available. The present study aimed to investigate water flow and solute transport processes in a water <b>repellent</b> sandy <b>soil,</b> and to introduce and apply new modeling approaches. Automated TDR measurements revealed that preferential pathways develop rapidly during severe rain storms, causing infiltrating water to be preferentially transported to the deeper subsoil. Furthermore, preferred pathways recurred at the same sites during all rain events. Simulations with a 2 -D, numerical finite element flow and transport model indicate that preferential flow paths will only form during infiltration into dry water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils,</b> i. e. in the range below the so-called critical soil water content. Incorporation of hysteresis is essential to generate the formation and recurrence of preferential flow paths with the model. The process of preferential flow and transport has been incorporated in the well-known SWAP model also, and applied to field data of tracer transport through a water <b>repellent</b> sandy <b>soil</b> in the Netherlands.

40|$|Water <b>repellent</b> (hydrophobic) <b>soils</b> {{impact the}} {{infiltration}} process {{of a water}} budget by restricting the movement of water into and through a soil body. The infiltration of water into a water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil</b> can be inhibited or completely impeded in which case much of the incoming precipitation reaching the soil surface becomes overland flow. One mechanism causing the formation of water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> is the distillation of organic compounds in the litter and duff layers during combustion in a fire (DeBano 1981, 1999, 2003, Doerr et al. 2000).

To study water ¯ow and transport in a water <b>repellent</b> sandy <b>soil,</b> a bromide tracer experiment had been carried out, which started in the fall after winter wheat had been sown. Despite the uniform tracer application, soil core sampling indicated that bromide concentrations varied largely from place to place. Wetter sites in the experimental ®eld received more bromide, due to lateral transport through a thin top layer. Wetting fronts in®ltrated deeper here, leading to perturbed wetting fronts in the experimental ®eld. In contrast to what was expected, the wetting front perturbations did not grow to ®ngers. Numerical results indicate that this was attributed to the relatively high soil water contents during the experiment, which caused the soil to be wettable instead of water repellent. The water-entry capillary pressure of the secondary wetting branch exceeds the air-entry capillary pressure of the primary drainage branch in this case. In the opposite situation, with the water-entry capillary pressure of the secondary wetting branch beneath the air-entry capillary pressure of the primary drainage branch, perturbations would have grown to ®ngers.

40|$|Water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> are {{difficult}} to irrigate and susceptible to preferential flow, which enhances the potential for accelerated leaching to groundwater of hazardous substances. Over 5 Mha of Australian <b>soil</b> is water <b>repellent,</b> while treated municipal sewage is increasingly used for irrigation. Only if a critical water content is exceeded will <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> become wettable. To avoid excessive loss {{of water from the}} root zone via preferential flow paths, irrigation schemes should therefore aim to keep the soil wet enough to maintain soil wettability. Our objective was to monitor the near-surface water content and water repellency in a blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantation irrigated with treated sewage. The plantation's sandy soil surface was strongly water repellent when dry. For 4 months, three rows of 15 blue gum trees each received no irrigation, three other rows received 50 % of the estimated potential water use minus rainfall, and three more rows received 100 %. During this period, 162 soil samples were obtained in three sampling rounds, and their water content (% dry mass) and degree of water repellency determined. Both high and low irrigation effectively wetted up the soil and eliminated water repellency after 2 (high) or 4 (low) months. A single-peaked distribution of water contents was observed in the soil samples, but the water repellency distribution was dichotomous, with 44 % extremely water-repellent and 36 % wettable. This is consistent with a threshold water content at which a soil sample changes from water repellent to wettable, with spatial variability of this threshold creating a much wider transition zone at the field scale. We characterized this transition zone by expressing the fraction of wettable samples as a function of water content, and demonstrated a way to estimate from this the wettable portion of a field from a number of water content measurements. To keep the plantation soil wettable, the water content must be maintained at a level at which a significant downward flux is likely, with the associated enhanced leaching. At water contents with negligible downward flux, the field is water repellent, and leaching through preferential flow paths is likely. Careful management is needed to resolve these conflicting requirements...|$|R

40|$|Three field {{sites were}} chosen to study the {{environmental}} assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil. These sites were the Werribee Farm and the Myome Farm in Australia and Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area in China. The Werribee Farm and the Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area received sewage treatment and application on land for a long time. The Myome farm is an experimental site in which investigations on land application of municipal wastewater on water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> is currently being trailed. Heavy metal contamination, in particular Cr, Cu and Zn, in the Land Filtration soil of Werribee Farm was widespread. More than a century of sewage irrigation {{has occurred in the}} Werribee Farm. The temporal distribution pattern of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the soil at this site follow an exponential trend with time and the spatial distribution pattern of accumulation of heavy metals in different paddocks correlates with the number of years of sewage irrigation at that site in the Farm. Extensive sewage irrigation at Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area resulted in significant Cd pollution in soil-plant (rice) system and poses a significant threat to the health of local people. Even after eight years since cessation of sewage irrigation, the bioavailable fractions of Cd in the soil as analyzed by sequential extraction techniques were very high thus illustrating long-term persistence. The simultaneous competitive adsorption of metals in water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> (at Myome Farm in South Australia) was studied. In the competitive situation, Cr, Pb and Cu are the heavy metal cations more strongly adsorbed by the soil, whereas Cd, Ni and Zn are the least adsorbed. The increase in Freundlich adsorption capacity by clay amendment suggested that clayed soils are capable sorption of higher heavy metal loadings compared to the non-clayed water <b>repellent</b> <b>soil,</b> which is more vulnerable to heavy metal inputs. A simple model of environmental assimilative capacity is proposed. The results of comparison of the three field sites shows that the Werribee Farm has a higher environmental assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil than the soils at Shenyang Zhangshi Irrigation Area and Myome Farm, however heavy metal contamination at Werribee Farm is still a concern. The model of environmental assimilative capacity of heavy metals in soil is an effective tool to assist management of effluent applied land irrigation systems and can be used to better design environmental engineering systems...|$|R
40|$|Australia is a water-stressed {{nation and}} demand on potable water supply is increasing. Consequently water {{conservation}} and reuse are increasingly becoming important. Irrigation of recycled wastewater on water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> is {{a technology that}} is being trialled {{as a means of}} improving crop production and conserving potable supply. However, recycled water contains potentially harmful heavy metals. This paper reports the competitive sorption and desorption of several common heavy metals found in soils collected from a farm located in the south-east of South Australia. The soil from this location is severely water repellent, but some sites were amended with kaolinite clay (Si 4 Al 4 O 10 (OH) 8) about 7 and 15 years ago. The metals studied were Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Zn. Competitive sorption of the metals was distinctly observed. For all heavy metals, the quantity of metal sorbed was higher in amended soil, and there was a strong correlation between the specific sorption to total sorption ratio and the amount of clay in the soil. The sorption intensities varied with metal, Cr, Pb, and Cu having a high sorption tendencies and Zn, Cd, and Ni having comparatively low sorption tendencies. The total sorption capacity for all metals increased in clay-treated soils compared with non-treated soils. On average, clay-amended water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> had a 20 – 40 % increased capacity to adsorb total metals; however, this increase was largely caused by the increased capacities to adsorb Zn, Cd, and Ni. The effect of clay treatment largely enhanced the sorption capacity of relatively weakly adsorbing heavy metals.

40|$|In {{the natural}} environment, soil water {{repellency}} decreases infiltration, increases runoff, and increases erosion in slopes. In the built environment, soil water repellency offers {{the opportunity to}} develop granular materials with controllable wettability for slope stabilization. In this paper, the influence of soil water repellency on the hydrological response of slopes is investigated. Twenty-four flume tests were carried out in model slopes under artificial rainfall; soils with various wettability levels were tested, including wettable (Contact Angle, CA 90 °). Various rainfall intensities (30 mm/h and 70 mm/h), slope angles (20 ° and 40 °) and relative compactions (70 % and 90 %) were applied to model the response of natural and man-made slopes to rainfall. To quantitatively assess the hydrological response, a number of measurements were made: runoff rate, effective rainfall rate, time to ponding, time to steady state, runoff acceleration, total water storage and wetting front rate. Overall, an increase in soil water repellency reduces infiltration and shortens the time for runoff generation, with the effects amplified for high rainfall intensity. Comparatively, the slope angle and relative compaction had only a minor contribution to the slope hydrology. The subcritical water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> sustained infiltration for longer than both the wettable and water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils,</b> which presents an added advantage {{if they are to be}} used in the built environment as barriers. This study revealed substantial impacts of man-made or synthetically induced soil water repellency on the hydrological behavior of model slopes in controlled conditions. The results shed light on our understanding of hydrological processes in environments where the occurrence of natural soil water repellency is likely, such as slopes subjected to wildfires and in agricultural and forested slopes...|$|R
30|$|A 2  ×  4  ×  3 {{factorial}} design {{was carried out}} using the polyester/cotton fabrics against hot water splash. In this three-way {{factorial design}}, the independent variables consisted of two different fabric structures (plain, twill), four different finish treatments (no treatment [regular], water <b>repellent,</b> <b>soil</b> release, combined stain and water repellent [Teflon®] finish) and three arrangements of fabric layer (1 layer, 2 layers and 3 layers). The dependent variables were the absorbed energy (during 60 s data acquisition) and {{the time required to}} create a second-degree burn and a third-degree burn injury prediction following exposure to hot water splash at 85  °C. Air permeability for all the eight different fabric types was also measured in 1, 2 and 3 layers combinations.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a simple and}} quick method for determining the presence of water repellency in a soil by using a small core sampler (1. 5 cm in diameter, 25 cm long) and applying the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test at different depths on the sandy soil cores. Obtained results provide spatial distribution patterns of water repellency in a soil profile, demonstrating seasonal changes in repellency. An advantage of the method is that the soil is not disturbed by the sampling. For assessment of the persistence of water repellency in strongly to extremely water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils,</b> and for determination of the critical soil water contents, the WDPT test and volumetric water content determinations should preferably be performed in the laboratory...|$|R
30|$|Immediately post-fire, a burn {{severity}} map for the Simi {{fire was}} created from post-fire airborne multispectral MASTER imagery (masterweb.jpl.nasa.gov) acquired on 1 November 2003 (Clark et al. 2003). The {{majority of the}} area within the Simi fire perimeter was burned at low or moderate severity, and BAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) teams in the field reported that the burn severity map was generally representative of the conditions observed on the ground (CDF 2003, Clark et al. 2003). However, several watersheds were assessed at a higher severity than indicated on the map and were at risk for increased post-fire erosion and debris flow (Cannon et al. 2003, CDF 2003). The BAER assessment team also noted the presence of white ash in severely burned areas, which indicated a high likelihood of water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> and increased erosion potential (CDF 2003, Lewis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Organised by American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Hong Kong Section and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityThe seminar {{will explore}} the {{potential}} of synthetic water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> in geotechnical engineering. New laboratory research by our team has demonstrated that wetting in soils can be controlled by inducing and adjusting water repellency. Existing soils can be treated on a construction site to become water repellent; once treated, they are non-intrusive, integrate with the surrounding environment and are mechanically stable (due to their non-wettable behaviour). This ongoing research will provide Hong Kong with a novel technology forconstructing water-tight barriers and fills that is both inexpensive and reliant on an abundant local resource – soils. Our research is aimed at verifying its stability, so that perceived risks to practical implementation are identified and alleviated...|$|R
40|$|Man-made raised sandy soils in the Netherlands are {{classified}} as `brown' or `black' plaggen soils. When dry, the brown soils are wettable, but the black <b>soils</b> are water <b>repellent.</b> For one growing season, transects were sampled in a maize cropped black plaggen soil at the Heino experimental farm. Due to interception and stemflow, water was concentrated near {{the roots of the}} maize. Between the maize rows, higher soil water contents were found in microdepressions, due to rainwater dripping to the ground from overhanging leaves. Redistribution of soil water from wet to dry areas was restricted by the water repellency of the dry sand. As a consequence, there was a distinct variation in soil moisture content. These irregular wetting patterns did not induce preferential downward flow, but widened over time; because the dry, water repellent subsoil impeded and resisted infiltration into the deeper subsoil...|$|R
30|$|The steep {{topography}} of the Simi fire area {{can be seen}} in Figure 3 from the shading on the north sides of ridges. The Old fire burned in similarly steep terrain, which is not as obvious from the images. The combination of steep terrain, burned soils, and lack of vegetative cover increases the potential for soil erosion. Our results suggest that a significant amount of vegetative cover was removed by the fire in some areas and that the soil there likely experienced extended heating, resulting in fire-induced water <b>repellent</b> <b>soils</b> and reduced infiltration capacity. We measured a relative infiltration rate on all sites using a mini-disk infiltrometer (Decagon Devices Inc., 2003) and found that most of the soils had a very low infiltration capacity (&lt; 1 ml min− 1). For reference, a similarly unburned soil will generally have an infiltration rate of &gt; 8 ml min− 1 (Lewis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Soil hydrophobia, {{or water}} repellency, in the coarse sand {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain in Perth in Western Australia is common, leading to reduced ater infiltration. The main {{practice}} recommended to alleviate water repellency {{is the use of}} wetting agents, most of which are surfactantbased. Five commercial wetting agents were evaluated for their effects on water infiltration into samples of native sandy soils. Capillary rise and double-ring infiltrometer methods were used for this purpose. The infiltration of water was somewhat improved with the application of wetting agents, but this was short-lived and, when measured a few days later, was similar to or lower than the infiltration in the untreated sand. These findings raise questions on the efficiency of surfactantbased wetting agents to treat waterrepellent soils. Further investigation into the interaction and adsorption between surfactants and soil particles is needed.
