Like in atacamite, {{there are two}} different types of Cu coordination geometries: Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral Cu(OH)4Cl2 and Cu(OH)5Cl. But these octahedra assemble in different ways. Each octahedron shares six edges with surrounding octahedra, forming a two-dimensional <b>sheet-type</b> structure parallel to (100). The adjacent sheets are held together by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl oxygen atoms of one sheet and the opposing chlorine atoms in the other sheets. The resulting weak bonding between the sheets accounts for the perfect (100) cleavage and the typical platy habit of botallackite (Figure 2).|$|E

An array of rectangular plastic actuators is mechanically processed from a perfluorinated polymer electrolyte membrane. A small semisphere, which projects upward from the rubberlike surface of the display, {{is attached to the}} tip of each rectangular actuator. The effective display size is 4 × 4 cm 2. Each Braille letter consists of 3 × 2 dots and 24 letters; in other words, 6 letters × 4 lines can be displayed. Pentacene field-effect transistors with top-contact geometry have a channel length of 20 µm and a mobility of 1 cm 2 /V · s. The Braille dots on one line are driven for 0. 9 s. The total thickness and weight of the entire device are 1 mm and 5. 3 g, respectively. The present scheme will enable people with visual impairments to carry the Braille sheet display in their pockets and read Braille e-books at any time.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{predicting}} {{the inception of}} cavitation in marine propellers rely heavily on physical model tests in cavitation tunnels and these tests are subject to complex scale effects.

40|$|The {{extent of}} genetic predetermination {{and hence the}} limits of {{developmental}} plasticity of phenotypes are largely unknown. In this context, we address a prominent theme of morphological variation in clonal organisms: the relative investment in vascular versus ramet tissue.

Surgical manipulations of gastrovascular architecture were used to alter flow patterns within developing runner and sheet colonies, and subsequent morphological development of colonies was assessed. Reducing within-colony variation in patterns of gastrovascular flow of runner colonies resulted in a lower rate of production of peripheral stolons and a <b>sheet-type</b> morphology. Experimentally increased variation in flow patterns within sheet colonies resulted {{in the development of}} peripheral stolons-hence, the initiation of a runnerlike growth trajectory.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{potential}} for greater safety, higher energy density, and scalable fabrication, bulk-type all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASLBs) employing deformable sulfide superionic conductors are considered highly promising for applications in battery electric vehicles. While fabrication of <b>sheet-type</b> electrodes is imperative from the practical point of view, reports on relevant research are scarce. This might be attributable to issues that complicate the slurry-based fabrication process and/or issues with ionic contacts and percolation. In this work, we systematically investigate the electrochemical performance of conventional dry-mixed electrodes and wet-slurry fabricated electrodes for ASLBs, by varying the different fractions of solid electrolytes and the mass loading. This information calls for a need to develop well-designed electrodes with better ionic contacts and to improve the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes. As a scalable proof-of-concept to achieve better ionic contacts, a premixing process for active materials and solid electrolytes is demonstrated to significantly improve electrochemical performance.

Experimental works using a drop weight {{impact test}} method have been {{performed}} on a circular sheet specimen to evaluate and to characterize the impact resistance of the <b>sheet-type</b> plastic components designed for automotive wheel covers. Evaluation has been conducted {{for a set of}} engineering plastics: polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and their blend (PC/ABS). The testing results showed that the PC/ABS blend specimens failed in brittle manner under higher impact speeds with very few of whitening zones. Secondary cracks captured perpendicular to fracture surface were also found in the mid-plane of the scattered PC/ABS blend specimens. Investigation is then focused on this blend and the testing results describe that impact resistance of the specimen made of this alternative material is determined by ABS not by PC. Combination of structures between PC and ABS through the thickness in the core due to their immiscibility was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) on the etched PC/ABS specimen. This latter result well correlates the results obtained from the testing. It therefore reveals that immiscibility between PC and ABS in the blend {{plays an important role in}} determining the impact resistance of the components.

We carried out an integrated geophysical study using self-potential (SP), gradient-resistivity profiling (GRP), and gravity study across the SPSZ to identify the near-surface structural features and probable correlation with the uranium mineralization of the region. We studied a broad low SP, anomaly zone correlated with corresponding low-gravity and low-resistive zone across the same {{part of the study}} area. This conductive and low-density zone was identified as the width of the brittle-to-ductile and highly altered SPSZ. The 2 D modeling of SP and residual gravity data along a northeast–southwest profile across the shear zone between Raghunathpur and Barabazar localities revealed the northerly dipping shear zone with an average width of ∼ 4. 5 km. However, the 2 D modeling of the SP data sug-gested numerous thick, <b>sheet-type</b> vertical and/or inclined structures intervening the shear zone, which were well correlated with the vertical structures delineated by the 2 D gravity inverse model. The vertical alteration zones (density and conductivity) at ∼ 40 -, 200 -, and 400 -m depths have been identified over this region. These alteration zones are likely to be mineralized zone because a hydrouranium anomaly has also been reported from those locations earlier.

The dependence of foam density on cell immobilization process, the effect of pH and BAPUF loading on ferrous oxidation were studied to choose operating parameters for continuous operations. With an objective to have high cell densities both in foam and the liquid phase, pretreated foams of density 50 kg/m 3 as cell support and ferrous oxidation at pH 1. 5 to moderate the ferric precipitation were preferred. A novel basket-type bioreactor for continuous ferrous iron oxidation, which features a multiple effect of stirred tank in combination with recirculation, was designed and operated.

40|$|There {{is intense}} {{activity}} {{in the area of}} theoretical chemistry of gold. It is now possible to predict new molecular species, and more recently, solids by combining relativistic methodology with isoelectronic thinking. In this thesis we predict a series of solid <b>sheet-type</b> crystals for Group- 11 cyanides, MCN (M=Cu, Ag, Au), and Group- 2 and 12 carbides MC 2 (M=Be-Ba, Zn-Hg). The idea of sheets is then extended to nanostrips which can be bent to nanorings. The bending energies and deformation frequencies can be systematized by treating these molecules as an elastic bodies. In these species Au atoms act as an 'intermolecular glue'. Further suggested molecular species are the new uncongested aurocarbons, and the neutral Au_nHg_m clusters. Many of the suggested species are expected to be stabilized by aurophilic interactions. We also estimate the MP 2 basis-set limit of the aurophilicity for the model compounds [ClAuPH_ 3]_ 2 and [P(AuPH_ 3) _ 4]^+. Beside investigating the size of the basis-set applied, our research confirms that the 19 -VE TZVP+ 2 f level, used a decade ago, already produced 74 % of the present aurophilic attraction energy for the [ClAuPH_ 3]_ 2 dimer. Likewise we verify the preferred C 4 v structure for the [P(AuPH_ 3) _ 4]^+ cation at the MP 2 level. We also perform the first calculation on model aurophilic systems using the SCS-MP 2 method and compare the results to high-accuracy CCSD(T) ones. The recently obtained high-resolution microwave spectra on MCN molecules (M=Cu, Ag, Au) provide an excellent testing ground for quantum chemistry. MP 2 or CCSD(T) calculations, correlating all 19 valence electrons of Au and including BSSE and SO corrections, are able to give bond lengths to 0. 6 pm, or better.

40|$|In {{the southeastern}} {{edge of the}} Iberian Meseta in {{southern}} Spain, fluvial continental Buntsandstein-facies red beds of Middle to Upper Triassic (Ladinian Norian) age unconformably overlie the folded and eroded Hercynian basement. The Setie Belts consist of an internal metamorphosed part and an external sedimentar y zone containing the Triassic deposits, with the latter seam being in turn divided into the Prebetic Zone with continental to shallow marine facies and the Subbetic Zone with pelagic facies. The Buntsandstein-facies red bed series is vertically split into three main facies associations: alluvial fans and pebbly braided rivers (conglomerates and sandstones), low-sinuosity proximal and distal sandy braided rivers (sandstones and mudstones) and coastal evaporitic sabkha (mudstones, marls and gypsum). Alluvial- fan and pebbly braided river sediments occur {{at the base of}} the sequence and cover the palaeorelief of the pre-Triassic morphology. The inner fan zone is characterized by debris-flows or mud-flows, the mid fan zone is dominated by sheet floods, and the auter fan zone is governed by stream flood and stream flow passing into pebbly braided rivers in front of the fans. With transition from restricted alluvial fans to an open braidplain, the pebbly rivers soon evolve both vertically and horizontally into sandy stream networks consisting of channels and floodplains. The channel facies comprises <b>sheet-type</b> and ribbon-type sandstone layers. The sheet s form complexes up to 15 m and more thiekness due to amalgamation by multilateral coalescence and multivertical stacking of individual genetical units. In the lower part of the series, the number of ehannels is rather high suggesting a non-hierarchical channel pattern where high- and low-sinuosity rivers coexisto The middle portion refleets a smaller number of very large channels thus indicating an amelioration of the hierarchical pattern. The upper part consists of variegated sabkha pIain mudstones and evaporites where channel deposits are almost absent. The floodplain facies is divided into proximal and distal parto The proximal floodplain facies comprises interbedded sandstones and mudstones containing sorne layers of nodular pedogenie carbonates and originates by overbank sheet-flood, levee overtopping and crevasse-splay sedimentation. The distal floodplain facies is built up of mud with minor layers of silt and fine sand with intercalations of micritic lacustrine limestones and originates in overbank lakes and ponds. Depositional sequen ces within the sandy braided river series comprise major sequences that are produced by migration of alluvial subenvironments during course of their aggradation, and minor sequences that are related to alternating high- and low-water stages with changing channel abandonment and stream neoformation. The fluvial architecture is highlighted by two types of depositional settings: proximal and distal facies. The proximal facies is characterized by predominantly straight channels without or with only poorly-developed levees and being infilled with sediments under rather high-energy conditions. The distal facies is characterized by low-sinuosity channels surrounded by better developed levees and being infilled under lower energy conditions than the proximal equivalents. With passage from the proximal to the distal facies, the floodplain sediments consist of increasingly more backswamp, levee and crevasse-splay deposits as well as of sediments of small meandering channels operating in the overhank plain between the large maín streams. The evaporitic complex at the top of the Triassic originates in en arid coastal intertidal belt and supratidal sahkha seam. Within the sandy braided river complexes, the different magnitudes and effectivities of currents in large channels, small watercourses and floodplain reaches are underlined by partially divergent, bimodal or even bipolar palaeocurrent directions. Copper mineralizations of mixed syngenetic and epigenetic type in the terrestrial red beds are associated with plant debris in sediments of inactive to abandoned secondary channels and comprise azurite, chrysocolla and malachite.
