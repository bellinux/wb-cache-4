5000|$|... 1972 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of the DM2, a three unit system, comprising an 8 inch bass/mid-range speaker rear loaded with an acoustic line, a Celestion HF1300 tweeter and a <b>super</b> <b>tweeter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>super</b> <b>tweeter</b> is a 1-inch LPF film dome with {{response}} from 8 to 23 kHz, which extends 3 kHz above the nominal range of audio frequencies {{which can be}} heard by the human ear.|$|E
5000|$|The four {{drivers of}} the Marantz HD77s are a woofer, mid-range, tweeter and <b>super</b> <b>tweeter.</b> The given {{frequency}} responses are what the crossover circuit fed to each speaker, not what each speaker {{would respond to}} with no crossover circuit. The mid-range, tweeter and <b>super</b> <b>tweeter</b> have controls for switching between a laboratory flat and neutral response and a room EQ response. Frequency response is measured in an anechoic chamber from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and displayed in a graph shown in original Marantz brochure. Crossover and frequency response are two different things. Crossover points are established for each driver within its specified frequency range. Without crossover points, the drivers would simply overheat and burn out, with exception of the woofer. The drivers perform {{together to create a}} frequency response.|$|E
50|$|The Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, or <b>Super</b> <b>Tweet,</b> is an American light attack {{aircraft}} {{developed from}} the T-37 Tweet basic trainer in the 1960s and 1970s by Cessna of Wichita, Kansas. The A-37 was introduced during the Vietnam War and remained in peacetime service afterward.|$|R
5000|$|The USAF {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Cessna in early 1967 for an improved <b>Super</b> <b>Tweet,</b> designated the [...] "A-37B". The initial order was for 57 aircraft, but this was quickly increased to 127. The A-37Bs were primarily intended to be supplied to the South Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) as replacements for their Skyraiders. The A-37B prototype was rolled out in September 1967, with deliveries to the South Vietnamese beginning in 1968.|$|R
50|$|<b>Super</b> Texts (and <b>tweets)</b> - Johns {{naming of}} a segment to cover {{responses}} to tweets and texts with a jingle {{set to the}} theme tune of childrens cartoon series Superted.|$|R
50|$|A <b>super</b> <b>tweeter</b> is {{generally}} intended to respond well into ultrasonic frequencies over 20 kHz, the commonly accepted upper frequency limit of human hearing. Super tweeters {{have been designed}} for psychoacoustic testing, for extended-range digital audio such as Super Audio CD intended for audiophiles, for biologists performing research on animal response to sounds, and for ambient sound systems in zoos. Ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 kHz and even 100 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>super</b> <b>tweeter</b> is {{a speaker}} driver {{intended}} to produce ultra high frequencies in a multi-driver loudspeaker system. Its {{purpose is to}} recreate a more realistic sound field, often characterized as [...] "airy-ness". Super tweeters are sometimes found in high fidelity speaker systems and sometimes even in home theater systems. They are used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or perhaps with distortion.|$|E
40|$|Sonar {{rings are}} {{composed}} of many ultrasonic receivers arranged in a ring and {{have in the past}} used many transmitters. The transmitters have been fired either serially or together and the receivers measure time-of-flight to reflectors in the environment. Serial transmission reduces the measurement rate around the entire ring, whilst parallel transmission incurs interference problems between neighbouring transmitters. This paper describes a new design employing a single high powered transmitter available from Murata (ESTD 01 <b>Super</b> <b>Tweeter)</b> and a parabolic conical reflector that overcomes both these issues. The reflector is designed to narrow the vertical beamwidth of the transmitter and to provide good dispersion of the sound around the ring. The paper details the design, TLM simulation and measurements that characterise the performance, such as the intensity compared to previous systems, the elevation beamwidth and the pulse shape. ...|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Hickey {{teamed up}} with media critic Steve Hall and Edward Boches, Mullen’s chief {{creative}} officer to live <b>tweet</b> <b>Super</b> Bowl XLIII advertising. Hickey, Hall, and Boches were looking to explore how pre-game advertising exposure online and real-time reactions to Super Bowl television advertising may begin to {{change the nature of}} the “Water Cooler” chatter and how consumers interact with brands.|$|R
5000|$|Twitter {{is used by}} TV {{operators}} and broadcasters to try to encourage viewers to get involved. This can {{take the form of}} on-screen hashtags, having celebrities tweet while a show airs, or contests around a TV show. Notable examples include Comedy Central using Twitter hashtags during the Comedy Awards [...] and BBC QuestionTime encouraging political debate. the During the 2011 Oscars, there were over 10,000 tweets per minute- with the event racking up 1.8 million tweets overall. During the 2011 <b>Super</b> Bowl, <b>tweets</b> peaked at 4,000 per second. In the UK, daily television shows also receive attention on Twitter, although the levels of activity is lower than a major TV event like the Oscars.|$|R
2500|$|Since his {{performance}} at the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 event, Jadeja has been a consistent target of sarcasm and jokes by cricket portals and Indian cricket fans. On Twitter and Facebook, he is jokingly referred to as Sir Ravindra Jadeja since an online joke calling him the same went viral. When Jadeja was out clean bowled for 16 while not offering {{a shot in the}} February 2013 Chennai test against Australia, a cricket portal described his dismissal as [...] "Jadeja falls 284 runs short of what would have been a fourth first-class triple-century". Following his good performance against Australia in the 2013 test series, there was a flurry of Jadeja jokes on Twitter comparing him to Rajinikanth. His Wikipedia article was temporarily vandalized to mock him. In April 2013, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina and Ravichandran Ashwin, teammates of Jadeja in Chennai <b>Super</b> Kings, <b>tweeted</b> several Jadeja jokes on Twitter, in one of which Dhoni referred to him as Sri Sri Pandit Sir Lord Ravindra Jadeja. In response, Jadeja said in April 2013 that it was a joke which everybody was enjoying, and that he had no problem with the prefix Sir.|$|R
