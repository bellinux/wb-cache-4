It provides a detailed view on the legislation regulating <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> in the legal order of the Czech Republic. Considering the interconnection of local derivatives markets, this diploma thesis pays attention to the legal regulation and standardization of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> in foreign countries and at the international level. The first part of this thesis describes basic features of derivatives and proposes their typology. The aim of the following part is to evaluate the contemporary legal regulation of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> in the Czech Republic. The rest of this thesis elaborates on foreign and international legal regulation of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts.</b> The main goal of this diploma thesis is to evaluate present the state of the regulation of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> in the Czech Republic, asses to what degree it reflects their economic nature, and eventually, propose legal changes...|$|R
40|$|The credit <b>derivative</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is a {{new type}} of contract in the Financial Law and Banking Law that emerged in the early 1990 ’s and now applies all over the world. The purpose of the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> is to transfer credit risk associated with underlying instruments to the counterpart, without delivering or transferring any of the underlying instrument itself. The part that takes over the credit risk receives payment for taking over the credit risk from the other part. The thesis analyses the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> in relation to the existing legislation, the legal nature of this type of contract and compares it to similar types of contracts in Swedish Law and English Law. The thesis analyses also the two main types of the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> and 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions and 2002 ISDA Master Agreement. These documents constitute the partly standardised documentation that is used to document the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract.</b> Based on the analysis described above, the thesis presents conclusions regarding development of the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract.</b> Some of important conclusions are that the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> is a different type of contract from the credit insurance contract and some other types of contract, that the credit <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> is dependent on its comprehensive documentation and that it {{is a new}} type of contract because it combines the existing legal terms and elements in a new way...|$|R

We firstly {{document}} {{the history of}} <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on the loan linked with human capital. Income Contingent Loan, a kind of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loans has been introduced in the country since 2010. Income Contingent Loan is an income-contingent derivative loan from lender``s viewpoint in that payments begin only if a precondition is met. It is a <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> from borrower``s viewpoint as well; whether to exercise the option of getting-a-job depends on repayment strategy. However, existing research only analyzes {{the current status of}} foreign cases without considering their history and Korean specific factors on the <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> for loans. There is no research on its background and historical development. We fill the gap of this literature using interesting international cases. We find that student loan system has been introduced in order to encourage individuals to pay higher fraction of education cost which the government has paid since the 1950 s. In the 1980 s, student loan system has particularly evolved and become to create <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on the loan in order to minimize lender``s economic burden and risk exposure. Furthermore, this study examine the future prospect of <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loan. The <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracting</b> on loan will evolve from debt-like toward equity-like investment. This will reduce the burden and exposure of governments while increasing the investment on human capital. This study has many policy implications discussing the development of student loan system, its vision and implementation...|$|R

Thus, some {{individuals}} and institutions will enter into a <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> to speculate on the value of the underlying asset, betting that the party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> when the future market price is less.|$|R

We develop asymptotic theory for the behavior of an estimated optimal <b>derivative</b> <b>contract</b> formed from estimates of the pricing kernel and underlying measure. Our optimal derivative corresponds to a direct investment in the underlying asset if and only if the pricing kernel is monotone decreasing. When the pricing kernel is not monotone decreasing, an investment of one monetary unit in our optimal derivative yields a payo� distribution that �rst-order stochastically dominates an investment of one monetary unit in the underlying asset. Recent empirical research suggests that the pricing kernel corresponding to a major US market index is not monotone decreasin...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} have escalated in {{significance in}} terms of their volume in global financial markets, widespread use and financial impact on companies and markets. They are akin to a two-edged sword; their use may mitigate or increase risk. Spectacular collapses in the past have brought considerable attention to these instruments. However, when used for hedging purposes, they potentially enhance or preserve value and mitigate risk of financial distress. Accounting for derivative instruments has had a difficult history with accounting standards adopting a piecemeal approach in accounting for financial instruments. However, accounting standards now require derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair values. Special requirements relating to hedge accounting apply to <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> that are entered into for risk mitigation. The United States were faster in arriving at a comprehensive standard that required companies to report their <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> on the balance sheet. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) had a more challenging task to garner support from its member bodies worldwide to adopt the on-balance sheet recognition of <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts.</b> However, its path-breaking standard, IAS 39 has {{had an impact on the}} way companies account for financial instruments. In its effort to reform IAS 39, the IASB has issued IFRS 9 which, while simplifying the accounting for financial instruments, continues to require the on-balance sheet recognition of <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts.</b> The “off-balance” sheet treatment of <b>derivative</b> <b>contracts</b> is clearly a thing of the past...|$|R

40|$|The {{collapse}} of Long Term Capital Management (2 ̆ 2 LTCM 2 ̆ 2) in Fall 1998 and the Federal Reserve Bank 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent efforts to orchestrate a bailout raise important {{questions about the}} structure of the Bankruptcy Code. The Code contains numerous provisions affording special treatment to financial <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts,</b> the most important of which exempts these contracts from the 2 ̆ 2 automatic stay 2 ̆ 2 and permits counterparties to terminate <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> with a debtor in bankruptcy and seize underlying collateral. No other counterparty or creditor of the debtor has such freedom; to the contrary, the automatic stay prohibits them from undertaking any act that threatens the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets. It is commonly believed that the exemption for <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> helps reduce 2 ̆ 2 systemic risk 2 ̆ 2 in financial markets, that is, the risk that multiple major financial market participants will fail at the same time and, as a result, drastically reduce market liquidity. Indeed, Congress is now contemplating reforms that would extend the exemption to include a broader array of financial contracts, {{all in the name of}} reducing systemic risk. This is a mistake. The Bankruptcy Code can do little to reduce systemic risk and may in fact exacerbate it, as the experience of L TCM suggests. Risk of a systemic meltdown arose there and prompted intervention by the Federal Reserve precisely because <b>derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> were exempt from the automatic stay. <b>Derivatives</b> <b>contracts</b> may merit special treatment, but fear of systemic risk is a red herring...|$|R
