5000|$|When undersampling a {{real-world}} signal, the <b>sampling</b> <b>circuit</b> must be {{fast enough to}} capture the highest signal frequency of interest. Theoretically, each sample should be taken during an infinitesimally short interval, {{but this is not}} practically feasible. Instead, the sampling of the signal should be made in a short enough interval that it can represent the instantaneous value of the signal with the highest frequency. This means that in the FM radio example above, the <b>sampling</b> <b>circuit</b> must be able to capture a signal with a frequency of 108 MHz, not 43.2 MHz. Thus, the sampling frequency may be only a little bit greater than 43.2 MHz, but the input bandwidth of the system must be at least 108 MHz. Similarly, the accuracy of the sampling timing, or [...] aperture uncertainty of the sampler, frequently the analog-to-digital converter, must be appropriate for the frequencies being sampled 108MHz, not the lower sample rate.|$|E

The output of this filter can then be subjected to another analog circuit for subsequent averaging. After each trigger event this <b>sampling</b> <b>circuit</b> has to be set back before receiving the next pulse. The time it takes for this reset {{is one of the major}} speed limitations for analog implementations, where maximum trigger rates of a few 10 kHz are typical even though the gate width itself can be as low as a few ten picoseconds and delay is set to zero.|$|E
