40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty {{children}} having impetigo were investigated bacteriologically. Pure growth of staphylococcus aureus was found in 92 children, Streptococcus pyogenes in 39 children and both organisms were isolated in 19 children. Forty four per cent Staphylococcus aureus and 82 % Streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin. One hundred children were treated with injection benzathine penicillin and fifty cases treated with oral tablet <b>sulfamoxole.</b> Benzathine pencillin was effective in 92. 3 % cases irrespective of whether the staphylococci and streptococci isolated were sensitive to penicillin or not. <b>Sulfamoxole</b> therapy was effective in 64 % children...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the susceptibility of promastigotes of Leishmania major to sulfonamides and sulfones in vitro. In a completely defined medium only <b>sulfamoxole,</b> sulfaquinoxaline, and dapsone were inhibitory; the concentrations required for 50 % inhibition {{of the rate}} of growth were 150, 600, and 600 microM, respectively. Eleven other sulfa drugs were ineffective at concentrations up to 2 mM. The growth inhibition was similar to that observed in procaryotes: the cells continued logarithmic growth for several cell doublings before inhibition was observed. Surprisingly, the addition of p-aminobenzoate or folate did not reverse the effects of the active sulfa drugs, the effects of <b>sulfamoxole</b> and methotrexate were additive rather than synergistic, and the addition of thymidine reversed methotrexate but not sulfa-drug inhibition. These results suggest that the mode of action of sulfa drugs on L. major is not by the classical route of inhibition of de novo folate synthesis. Promastigotes could be propagated for more than 40 passages in a completely defined medium in which the only added pterin was biopterin. The folate concentration in this medium was less than 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 11) M, as determined by a Leishmania bioassay. Although these data suggest that L. major may be capable of de novo synthesis of folate, the nonclassical mode of action of sulfa drugs, as well as other studies, favors the view that L. major is auxotrophic for folate...|$|E

The complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, copper determination, molar conductance, magnetic and decomposition temperature measurements, electron spin resonance, thermogravimetry, infrared, and electronic spectral studies. A trans octahedral structure has been proposed for these complexes.

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of 22 sulfonamides in pork, including sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfamera-zinesulfadoxine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, <b>sulfamoxole,</b> sulfaphenazole, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim and sulfisomidine, with matrix solid phase dispersion and high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %. The limits of quantitation were 5 ~ 10 μg/kg. Conclusion The advantages of this method are fast, efficient, less organic reagent and low cost. It is suitable for the determination of sulfonamides residues in pork...|$|E
40|$|Field {{application}} of livestock manure introduces colloids and veterinary antibiotics, e. g. sulfonamides (SAs), into farmland. The presence of manure colloids may potentially intensify the SAs-pollution to soils and groundwater by colloid-facilitated transport. Transport of three SAs, sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMPD), and <b>sulfamoxole</b> (SMOX), {{was investigated in}} saturated soil columns with and without manure colloids from sows and farrows, weaners, and fattening pigs. Experimental results showed that colloid-facilitated transport of SMOX was significant {{in the presence of}} manure colloids from fattening pigs with low C/N ratio, high SUVA 280 nm and protein C, while manure colloids from sows and farrows and weaners had little effect on SMOX transport. In contrast, only retardation was observed for SDZ and SMPD when manure colloids were present. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of colloids and SAs were replicated well by a newly developed numerical model that considers colloid-filtration theory, competitive kinetic sorption, and co-transport processes. Model results demonstrate that mobile colloids act as carriers for SMOX, while immobile colloids block SMOX from sorbing onto the soil. The low affinity of SMOX to sorb on immobile colloids prevents aggregation and also promotes SMOX's colloid-facilitated transport. Conversely, the high affinity of SDZ and SMPD to sorb on all types of immobile colloids retarded their transport. Thus, manure properties play a fundamental role in increasing the leaching risk of hydrophobic sulfonamides...|$|E
40|$|Several sulfonamide {{antimicrobials}} (SAAs) {{are largely}} used in veterinary medicine. A rapid, specific, and sensitive procedure for determining 12 SAAs in cheese is presented. The method {{is based on}} the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique followed by liquid chromatography (LC) -tandem mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from Mozzarella, Asiago, Parmigiano, Emmenthal, and Camembert cheese samples by 6 mL of water modified with 10 % methanol and heated at 120 degrees C. The addition of methanol to hot water served to improve remarkably extraction yields of the most lipophilic SAAs, that is, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline. After acidification and filtration, 100 mu L of the aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the multireaction monitoring mode, selecting two precursor-to-product ion transitions for each target compound. Methanol-modified hot water appeared to be an efficient extractant, because absolute recovery ranged between 67 and 88 %. Using <b>sulfamoxole</b> as surrogate analyte, recovery of the 12 analytes spiked in the five types of cheese considered at the 50 ng/g level ranged between 75 and 105 % with RSD not higher than 11 %. Statistical analysis of the mean recovery data showed that the extraction efficiency was not affected by the type of cheese analyzed. This result indicates this method could be applied to other cheese types not considered here. The accuracy of the method was determined at three spike levels, that is, 20, 50, and 100 ng/g, and varied between 73 and 102 % with relative standard deviastions ranging between 4 and 12 %. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to be < 1 ng/g...|$|E
