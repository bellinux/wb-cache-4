In August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its Lexus <b>spare</b> parts prices in China by up to 35 percent.

5|$|Lexington was {{designed}} to carry 78 aircraft, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up <b>spare</b> aircraft in the unused spaces {{at the top of}} the hangar. In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve.

40|$|Rational {{planning}} of <b>spares</b> configuration project {{is an effective}} approach to improve equipment availability as well as reduce life cycle cost (LCC). With an analysis of various impacts on support system, the <b>spares</b> demand rate forecast model is constructed. According to systemic analysis method, <b>spares</b> support effectiveness evaluation indicators system is built, and then, initial <b>spares</b> configuration and optimization method is researched. To the issue of discarding and consumption for incomplete repairable items, its expected backorders function is approximated by Laplace demand distribution. Combining the (s− 1, s) and (R, Q) inventory policy, the <b>spares</b> resupply model is established under the batch ordering policy based on inventory state, and the optimization analysis flow for <b>spares</b> configuration is proposed. Through application on shipborne equipment <b>spares</b> configuration, the given scenarios are analyzed under two constraint targets: one is the support effectiveness, {{and the other is}} the <b>spares</b> cost. Analysis reveals that the result is consistent with practical regulation; therefore, the model’s correctness, method’s validity as well as optimization project’s rationality are proved to a certain extent...|$|R

5|$|This arrangement, however, left Wyoming—the third-most {{powerful}} ship of the division—as the <b>spare</b> ship {{because she}} lacked a matched pair.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to maintain cost-effective <b>spares</b> stockpiles {{for an entire}} DSN station or complex as new modules or subsystems are continuously added.
