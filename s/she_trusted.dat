25|$|About {{ten years}} after Dee's death, the {{antiquarian}} Robert Cotton purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar Méric Casaubon, who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits. As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is {{largely responsible for the}} image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic. Around the same time the True and Faithful Relation was published, members of the Rosicrucian movement claimed Dee as one of their number. There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity. Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists, writers of horror stories and latter-day magicians. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England. Queen Elizabeth I used him as her court astronomer {{on a number of occasions}} not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom <b>she</b> <b>trusted.</b>|$|E

Vandernoot thought that [...] "...the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself (...) because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. <b>She</b> <b>trusted</b> him entirely and he trusted her."

2500|$|Having searched Castor's computer, {{prosecutors}} had found several drafts {{of the suicide}} note Ashley was accused of writing. Forensic investigators found that based on the timestamps, it had been written while Ashley was in school, proving she couldn't have been its author. They argued that the [...] "suicide attempt" [...] had actually been a planned-out murder attempt by Castor against Ashley. On the stand, Ashley retold how her mother had convinced her to drink the two nights before she almost died. She repeated that she only drank the [...] "nasty-tasting" [...] beverage because <b>she</b> <b>trusted</b> Castor.

2500|$|After a brief {{appearance}} in the Top Forty in early 1982 with Johnny Mathis on [...] "Friends in Love" [...] — from the album {{of the same name}} — Warwick's next hit later that same year was her full-length collaboration with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees for the album Heartbreaker. The song became one of Warwick's biggest international hits, returning her to the Top 10 of Billboard's Hot 100 as well as #1 Adult Contemporary and No. 2 in both Great Britain and Australia. The tune was also a Top 10 hit throughout continental Europe, Australia (#1), Japan, South Africa, Canada and Asia. The title track was taken from the album of the same name which sold over 3 million copies internationally and earned Warwick an RIAA USA Gold record award for the album. In Britain, the disc was certified Platinum. Warwick later stated to Wesley Hyatt in his Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits that she was not initially fond of [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] but recorded the tune because <b>she</b> <b>trusted</b> the Bee Gees' judgment {{that it would be a}} hit. The project came about when Clive Davis was attending his aunt's wedding in Orlando, Florida in early 1982 and spoke with Barry Gibb. Gibb mentioned that he had always been a fan of Warwick's, and Davis arranged for Warwick and the Bee Gees to discuss a project. Warwick and the Gibb brothers obviously hit it off as both the album and the title single were released in October 1982 to massive success.|$|E
2500|$|On Ashley's {{first day}} of college, {{investigators}} came to her school to question her about her father's death and to inform {{her that he had}} been poisoned instead of having died of a heart attack. An upset Ashley called Castor. Soon after, she says that Castor invited her to come to the family home in Weedsport and drink together. Castor said that they had been through enough emotional stress and needed to relax. Ashley agreed because Castor was not only her mother but her [...] "best friend". The following day, Castor invited Ashley to drink together at home again. She says that her mother offered her a [...] "nasty-tasting" [...] drink that she at first refused but eventually drank because <b>she</b> <b>trusted</b> Castor. Seventeen hours later, Ashley was found comatose on her bed by her younger sister Bree Wallace. Castor made the 911 call. Ashley's sister left her side for a moment and when she returned, she found a suicide note beside Ashley. The note appeared to be Ashley's [...] "murder confession", in which she [...] "admits" [...] to having killed her father and stepfather. Castor quickly took the note from the sister and later gave it to the paramedics. Tests revealed that potentially fatal painkillers had been found in Ashley's system, and that she most likely would have died if brought to the hospital just a few minutes later. When Ashley awakened, with police questioning her about the murders and the suicide note found beside her, she said that the last thing she remembered was her mother making her an alcoholic drink, something she had never done before. She told the officers that she did not write the note and was confused about their questions and accusations.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2007 {{issue of}} US Magazine, Simpson {{was quoted as}} saying the album would have a more [...] "mature" [...] sound, yet still remain [...] "rock". In the June 2007 issue of Cosmopolitan, she said that as she was {{becoming}} more mature, her music was changing, and that the new album would have less focus on relationship trouble and breakups. According to Simpson, the album was initially intended as a [...] "singer-songwriter record", but she subsequently decided to change course and do something more [...] "fun". Simpson revealed to E! News in June 2007 that her third album would have fun, dance songs, as well as break-up songs. She was also quoted as saying: [...] "Who knows!? Maybe I'll fall in love on this record!" [...] Simpson gave MTV a sneak peek of the album on September 8. It was described by Simpson as being based on beats more than guitars, unlike her previous albums. Among the songs was [...] "Murder", featuring Travis McCoy. Simpson mentioned her work on Chicago as being one source of inspiration for the album, and she said that [...] "there's a part of every girl and guy who wants to get out and get away with things", mentioning a kind of alter-ego on the album called [...] "Vicky Valentine". Aside from [...] "Murder", other songs mentioned by MTV were [...] "Follow You Wherever You Go" [...] (described as [...] "jazzed-up"), [...] "Rulebreaker", [...] "Ay Ay Ay", and [...] "Ragdoll". According to MTV, Simpson had recorded six songs with Timbaland and seven with Chad Hugo and Kenna. Later, in November, Simpson downplayed the [...] "Vicky Valentine" [...] alter-ego aspect of the album, saying that it [...] "got a little blown out of proportion" [...] and that it was [...] "a joke for us making the record, and it's all lighthearted and all in good fun. It's me {{at the end of the}} day. We've all got different sides to us." [...] In an interview with CosmoGIRL! for its December 2007/January 2008 issue (for which she was the cover girl), Simpson said that she did not feel that she needed to prove herself when making this album and that she had a [...] "stronger vision" [...] for it. She also said that she challenged herself by [...] "working with new sounds and new people" [...] and that, although there was an expectation that she would be influenced by her boyfriend Pete Wentz to move further in the direction of rock with this album, she chose the opposite course, describing the result as a [...] "fun party album" [...] with a [...] "silly and quirky" [...] side. According to Simpson, <b>she</b> <b>trusted</b> her instincts in making the album and [...] "felt free to be fun and crazy and sexy".|$|E
