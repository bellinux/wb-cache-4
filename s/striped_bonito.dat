5000|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> (Sarda orientalis) is {{a species}} of marine perciform fish. They have been {{recorded}} at lengths of 102 cm, though they are commonly no longer than 55 cm. Distributed through the Indo-Pacific and East Pacific, the <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> is known to occur at depths from 1 to 167 m. They are called mackerel bonito.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic bonito share Atlantic waters {{with the}} <b>striped</b> <b>bonito,</b> Sarda orientalis (the Atlantic {{population}} {{of which is}} sometimes considered a separate species, Sarda velox). The <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> has been taken on the Atlantic coast {{as far north as}} Cape Cod. It is similar in its habits, but somewhat smaller than the more common Atlantic bonito. The Atlantic bonito can be distinguished from its relative by its dark oblique stripes on the back and with a maxillary only about half as long as the head, whereas the <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> has striping on its topside nearly horizontal and a maxillary more than half the length of the head.|$|E
50|$|The {{skipjack}} tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, is {{a medium-sized}} perciform {{fish in the}} tuna family, Scombridae. It is otherwise known as the aku, arctic bonito, mushmouth, oceanic <b>bonito,</b> <b>striped</b> tuna, or victor fish. It grows up to 1 m (3 ft) in length. It is a cosmopolitan pelagic fish found in tropical and warm-temperate waters. It {{is a very important}} species for fisheries.|$|R
50|$|Tidal waters support {{extensive}} salt marshes, {{especially around}} Poucha Pond. The Cedars is {{a grove of}} century-old, low-growing eastern red cedars sculpted by salt spray and wind. Cape Poge Elbow {{is home to a}} gull rookery and nests of piping plovers, least terns, and oyster catchers. West of the dunes lies Cape Poge Bay, where calm, clear waters serve as a nursery for finfish and shellfish. Powerful currents push through the Gut, flushing Cape Poge Bay with oxygen-rich water and attracting <b>striped</b> bass, bluefish, <b>bonito,</b> and albacore.|$|R
50|$|The boats cruise {{along the}} edge of the {{continental}} shelf where billfish can be found down to 200 metres (600 ft), sometimes near weed lines at the surface and submarine canyons and ridges deeper down. Commercial fishermen usually use drift nets or longlines to catch billfish, but recreational fishermen usually drift with bait fish or troll a bait or lure. Billfish are caught deeper down the water column by drifting with live bait fish such as ballyhoo, <b>striped</b> mullet or <b>bonito.</b> Alternatively, they can be caught by trolling at the surface with dead bait or trolling lures designed to imitate bait fish.|$|R

5000|$|The {{leaping bonito}} (Cybiosarda elegans) is {{a species of}} {{saltwater}} finfish from the Scombridae (Mackerel) family. Scombridae includes such tribes as the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos - the latter of which, the Sardini tribe, this fish is a member. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Cybiosarda, which is therefore called a monotypic taxon. [...] Since the bonitos and tunas are close relatives, this fish has variously been referred to by such other common names as Australian tuna, <b>striped</b> <b>bonito,</b> and Watson's bonito.|$|E
40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> Sarda orientalis (Temminck and Schlegel, 1844) {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in the Indo- Pacific region from east coast of Africa {{to the west coast}} of America (Jones, 1960). It grows to a length of over half a metre and does not form a regular fishery of any appreciable magnitude anywhere...|$|E
40|$|Tunas are commercially {{important}} {{fish and}} widely but sparsely {{distributed throughout the}} oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters. They are grouped taxonomically in the family Scombridae, which includes about 50 species. The {{most important of these}} in commercial and recreational fisheries are yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) (Fig. 1), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), bluefin tuna (T. tonggol), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard) mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis) and <b>striped</b> <b>bonito</b> (T. orientalis). They are exploited mainly by hooks and line, mechanised gillnets and trawlnets in India...|$|E
