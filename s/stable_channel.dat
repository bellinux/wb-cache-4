Using mean field analysis, we derive the impact of input structuring on the overall stability of attractors formed.

40|$|Stable self-channeling of ultra-powerful (P{sub 0 } - 1 TW - 1 PW) laser pulses {{in dense}} plasmas {{is a key}} process for many {{applications}} requiring the controlled compression of power at high levels. Theoretical computations predict that the transition zone between the stable and highly unstable regimes of relativistic/charge-displacement self-channeling is well characterized by a form of weakly unstable behavior that involves bifurcation of the propagating energy into two powerful channels.

40|$|Predatory {{species have}} been {{introduced}} to habitats spanning {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions. To better understand the consequences of predation in natural communities we need to examine how variations in abiotic factors modify the influence of predation. The effects of introduced predators may vary amongst habitats if natural disturbance affects the abundance and taxonomic composition of consumers and their resources, or the predator alters recolonisation after disturbance. We tested whether a bed-moving disturbance altered subsequent interactions involving native and introduced predatory fish, invertebrate grazers and algae in experimental channels within a New Zealand stream. Disturbance reduced the abundance of invertebrates by 84 %, and induced mortality of Conoesucidae caddisflies. However, the relative abundance of taxa changed little immediately following the disturbance. Invertebrate communities recovered following disturbance in fishless channels and those with native galaxiids (Galaxias vulgaris), and were almost indistinguishable from undisturbed fishless controls after 2 weeks. Invertebrate abundance declined and algal abundance increased in channels with exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta) and their effect was strongest in previously disturbed channels. However, predators and disturbance only had interactive effects on grazer emigration rates. Trout affected grazers through direct consumption (e. g. Conoesucidae caddisflies), and induced higher emigration rates of grazers from channels via drift (e. g. the mayfly Deleatidium). The effects of predatory trout and galaxiids combined differed in disturbed and <b>stable</b> <b>channels.</b> The observed combined effects of predatory trout and galaxiids on invertebrate grazers were lower than expected in <b>stable</b> <b>channels</b> partly due to low emigration rates of Conoesucidae, whereas emigration of grazers was higher than expected in the disturbed channels. The biomass of algae was higher than expected in disturbed channels with both predators. Collectively, our results indicate that predator substitutability and the non-lethal effects of introduced predators varied depending on disturbance history, but their effects on the biomass of grazers and algae did not...|$|R

The regime theory provides {{the possibility of}} empirical and semi-empirical investigations of <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> design in which erosion and sediment transport are in equilibrium. The objective {{of this research is}} an investigation and a comparison of the influence of uniform and non-uniform flows on the prediction of <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics. The following empirical and semi-empirical (extremal hypothesis) equations were selected to study the effect of uniform flow: Lacey, Chital, Kondap and Garde, and Chang. Using 24 regime channels in USA, the statistical and graphical approaches were applied to compare and to evaluate the power of prediction of the selected equations. In order to investigate the effect of non-uniform flow structure on the <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics, 21 measured velocity profiles in Gamasiab River were applied. Using the boundary-layer theory, shear velocity was computed for each profile. Accordingly, the estimated Shields parameter using the boundary-layer approach is the most effective parameter on the regime channel prediction.

40|$|Abstract—In any {{wireless}} network, {{the same}} channel must be reused at spatially separated access points (APs) or base stations (BSs) and hence, the co-channel interference (CCI) limits the transmission quality. Therefore, {{it is very}} important to reuse the channels so as to minimize the CCIs. We recently proposed an interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA), which can form a <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> reuse pattern in a distributed manner. The use of transmit power control (TPC) can avoid the excessive transmit power and hence, contributes to reducing the CCI. An interesting question is if the IACS-DCA can form a <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> reuse pattern when TPC is used. In this paper, we give an answer to this question and show by computer simulation that a <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> reuse pattern can be formed even if TPC is used and that the transmit power can be significantly reduced.

To investigate this discrepancy, wide and narrow trapezoidal channels were studied in terms of wetted perimeter, hydraulic radius and side slope and compared with equal-area rectangular channels. It was found that the hydraulic radius, side slope and the threshold of motion are the main factors influencing the difference between the predicted and observed geometric shapes and sediment concentration. Based on this, a modification to the WBP method in terms of hydraulic radius and threshold of motion was suggested. Flume data were used to highlight the improvement made by this modification...|$|R
40|$|The {{periodical}} modulation of {{circularly polarized}} light with a frequency {{close to the}} electron spin resonance frequency induces a sharp change of the single electron spin orientation. Hyperfine interaction provides a feedback, thus fixing the precession frequency of the electron spin in the external and the Overhauser field near the modulation frequency. The nuclear polarization is bidirectional and the electron-nuclear spin system (ENSS) possesses a few stable states. A similar frequency-locking effect exists for two-color and mode-locked excitations, too. However, the pulsed excitation with mode locked laser brings about the multitudes of stable states in ENSS in a quantum dot. The resulting precession frequencies of the electron spin differ in these states by the multiple of the modulation frequency.

40|$|Etna’s 2001 basaltic {{lava flow}} {{provided}} {{a good example}} of the distal flow segment between the flow front and <b>stable</b> <b>channel,</b> across which the flow evolves from channel-contained to dispersed. This zone was mapped with meter precision using LIDAR data collected during 2004 and 2005. These data, supported by field mapping, show that the flow front comprised eight lobes each 10 to 20 m high. The flow front appears to have advanced not as a single unit, but as a series of lobes moving forward one lobe at a time. Primary lobes were centered on the channel axis and marginal lobes were off-axis. The lobes advanced as breakouts of low-yield-strength lava from the flow core of the stalled flow front. Marginal lobes were abandoned and contributed to marginal levees flanking the transitional channel. For Etna’s 2001 flow, the transitional channel is 140 m wide, 700 m long and fed a 240 -m-long zone of dispersed flow; the change from stable to transitional channel occurred at a major reduction in slope. Above this, the <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> is 5. 2 km long, 55 to 105 m wide and bounded by 15 - to 25 -m-high levees, and the <b>stable</b> <b>channel</b> is located over a previous channel.

Taking advantages of the long open duration of the dimer peptide channels, the current-voltage (I-V) relations of the single-channels were obtained by applying fast voltage ramps during the open states. The I-V relations showed rectification, such that current from the cis-side toward the trans-side is larger than that in the opposite direction. The intrinsic rectification is mainly attributed to the macro dipoles of parallel peptide helices surrounding a central pore. ...|$|R
