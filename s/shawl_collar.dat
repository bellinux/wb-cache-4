25|$|The shawl lapel, roll collar, or <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> is a {{continuous}} curve. Originally {{seen on the}} Victorian smoking jacket, it is now most common on the dinner jacket or tuxedo. This similarly began as informal eveningwear, and was then made in both more and less formal versions, depending {{on the situation in}} which it was to be used. It is also commonly used on the mess jackets.|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats were high-waisted, and {{squared off}} at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that {{overlapped}} those of the jacket began {{to fall out of}} fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually waistcoats became less visible. Shortly before this time waistcoats were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white waistcoats were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped waistcoats. High-collared waistcoats were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> came into use toward the end of this period.|$|E

50|$|His {{understated}} {{and romantic}} designs, featuring <b>shawl</b> <b>collars,</b> dropped shoulders and narrow fitted trousers or tulip-shaped skirts worn with flat shoes {{were seen as}} {{the antithesis of the}} 1980s power dressing trend and some predicted he would become the Armani of the 1990s. His designs were replicated on the high street and he developed a lucrative perfume range. Alexander McQueen was among his fashion assistants, joining the designer in 1989.|$|R

2500|$|In mid-decade, a {{more relaxed}} formal coat appeared: the dinner jacket or tuxedo, which {{featured}} a <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> with silk or satin facings, {{and one or two}} buttons. [...] Dinner jackets were appropriate when [...] "dressing for dinner" [...] at home or at a men's club.|$|E
2500|$|The most formal {{evening dress}} {{remained}} a dark tail coat and trousers {{with a dark}} or light waistcoat. [...] Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with a winged collar. [...] The less formal dinner jacket or tuxedo, which featured a <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button.

25|$|Frock coats (in French redingotes) {{were worn}} for {{informal}} day wear, were calf length, {{and might be}} double-breasted. Shoulders were narrower and slightly sloped. Waistcoats or vests were single- or double-breasted, with <b>shawl</b> or notched <b>collars,</b> and might be finished in double points at the lowered waist.|$|R
60|$|The {{first impulse}} of the Prince of Fairoaks was {{to pay for}} the whole party, and to make away with his {{newspaper}} order as poor Costigan had done with his own ticket. But his instinct, and the appearance of the two women, told him that they would be better pleased if he did not give himself the airs of a grand seigneur, and he handed his purse to Costigan, and laughingly pulled out his ticket with one hand, as he offered the other to the elder of the ladies--ladies was not the word--they had bonnets and <b>shawls,</b> and <b>collars</b> and ribbons, and the youngest showed a pretty little foot and boot under her modest grey gown, but his Highness of Fairoaks was courteous to every person who wore a petticoat whatever its texture was, and the humbler the wearer, only the more stately and polite in his demeanour.|$|R
25|$|During the 1840s, men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock {{coats and}} a {{waistcoat}} or vest. The vests were single- or double-breasted, with <b>shawl</b> or notched <b>collars,</b> {{and might be}} finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. The shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide cravats or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and breeches were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore top hats, with wide brims in sunny weather.|$|R
2500|$|A cummerbund may be {{worn with}} a dinner jacket {{in lieu of}} a {{waistcoat}} and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially good with a <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels. The material of the cummerbund should be silk satin, grosgrain (or faille), or barathea to match that of the bow tie. [...] It features upward facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the waistcoat, cummerbunds are not worn with a double breasted jacket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed and shawl) are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave, but can also be silk barathea. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> are equally authentic and correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} tuxedo jackets were of {{the same}} black material as the dress coat with one, two or no buttons and a <b>shawl</b> <b>collar</b> faced in satin or ribbed silk.

50|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Britain's own rockabilly {{subculture}} appropriated the then fashionable Edwardian revivalist fashion {{due to its}} resemblance to the clothing worn by Old West gamblers and the zoot suits seen in gangster films.
