50|$|For maximum precision, {{there should}} still be a {{significant}} area of white visible around the bullseye and between {{the front and rear}} sight <b>ring</b> (if a <b>front</b> <b>ring</b> is being used).

6000|$|He {{felt himself}} utterly {{corrupted}} by her wickedness, {{and the most}} significant symptom of his moral downfall was the bitter, acrid satisfaction with which he recognized it. He, deliberately, swore in his thoughts; he meditated sneers; he shaped in profound silence words of cynical unbelief, and his most cherished convictions stood revealed finally as the narrow prejudices of fools. A crowd of shapeless, unclean thoughts crossed his mind in a stealthy rush, like a band of veiled malefactors hastening to a crime. He put his hands deep into his pockets. He heard a faint ringing somewhere, and muttered to himself: [...] "I am {{not the only one}} [...] . not the only one." [...] There was another <b>ring.</b> <b>Front</b> door! ...|$|R

50|$|The major {{innovations}} {{since then}} {{have been the}} switch from friction to indexed shifting and the gradual {{increase in the number}} of gears. With friction shifting, the rider first moves the lever enough for the chain to jump to the next sprocket, and then adjusts the lever a slight amount to center the chain on that sprocket. An indexed shifter has a detent or ratchet mechanism which stops the gear lever, and hence the cable and the derailleur, after moving a specific distances with each press or pull. Indexed shifters require re-calibration when cables stretch and parts get damaged or swapped. On racing bicycles, 10-gear rear cassettes appeared in 2000, and 11-gear cassettes appeared in 2009. Most current mountain bicycles have either two or three front chainrings with single <b>ring</b> <b>front</b> setups becoming increasingly popular. Most road bicycles have two chainrings, and touring bicycles commonly have three.|$|R

Bevan awarded Primary Colours a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A−, which, according to him, corresponds to [...] "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction". He also wrote that they do [...] "the same thing punk bands have always done" [...] and described the album as a [...] "recurring miracle." [...] Chris Richards compared the album to many early punk and post-punk bands such as [...] "a breezier Stooges" [...] or [...] "The Fall with less squall". He concluded that the album was [...] "the most righteous rock-and-roll moment of 2008". A more mixed review written by Emily Mackay awarded Primary Colours a rating of 7 out of 10 and criticised it for its lack of originality.|$|R
