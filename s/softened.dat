5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly <b>softened</b> silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising <b>softened</b> calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{dynamic and}} static <b>softening</b> {{behaviors}} during multistage hot deformation of aluminum alloys {{have been studied}} by double-hit compression testing in the temperature range of 300 - 400 ºC. The interrupted deformations were conducted with delay times varying between 30 and 120 seconds after achieving a strain of approximately 0. 4 in the first stage. It was indicated that the considerable dynamic <b>softening</b> and exceptional <b>softening</b> associated with a structure <b>softening</b> exist in alloy deformation at 400 ºC, leading to an initial flow stress value at the second deformation lower than that at the first deformation. For all alloys studied, the static <b>softening</b> increases with increasing deformation temperature and holding temperature and delay times.

For instance, in the Ancient Egyptian Ebers medical papyrus, a mother was instructed to give a medical remedy to a child through premastication. In the fifth century A.D. Roman culture, premastication of infants' food by caretakers was also common, though the lack of sanitation along with the practice contributed to infant mortality. Infants in Medieval Europe were fed an assortment of mashed, premasticated food or bread <b>softened</b> with liquids.|$|E

40|$|Firmness is an {{important}} trait of postharvest quality in apple fruit (Malus domestica). This study characterises <b>softening</b> rates of early season cultivars before, during, and after controlled atmosphere (CA) storage. 'Royal Gala' and 'Cox's Orange Pippin' apples in CA had a triphasic <b>softening</b> curve during storage {{similar to that of}} fruit in regular air storage (RA). Fruit in CA had a longer initial slow <b>softening</b> phase, and a slower rapid <b>softening</b> phase, than fruit in RA. Firmness benefits in the market arising from CA were attained only when CA was applied to fruit before the onset of rapid <b>softening.</b> Fruit in CA also exceeded an internal ethylene concentration (IEC) of 1. 5 mu l litre(- 1) later, and had a lower maximum IEC, than fruit in air. Thus, CA may extend the initial slow <b>softening</b> phase, and reduce <b>softening</b> in the rapid <b>softening</b> phase by decreasing ethylene production in both cultivars. status: publishe...|$|R

Attitudes on this matter <b>softened</b> during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of Fleet Units: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. While Australia and Canada were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies, other fleet units would be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East; New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station.|$|E
5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55).

In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and <b>softened</b> its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

50|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} to <b>soften</b> hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract {{the effects of}} hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water <b>softening</b> is often unnecessary. Where <b>softening</b> is practised, it is often recommended to <b>soften</b> only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water <b>softening</b> {{involves the use of}} ion exchange resins, which replace ions like Ca2+ by twice the number of monocations such as sodium or potassium ions.|$|R

A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have <b>softened</b> and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{exchange}} rates and <b>softening</b> of 'Braeburn' apples were measured under {{a range of}} modified atmosphere conditions to characterise their functional relationship. Both gas exchange (measured as CO 2 production) and <b>softening</b> were maximally suppressed at around 1 - 1. 5 kPa O- 2. At these low O- 2 levels, CO 2 {{had no effect on}} the rate of <b>softening.</b> Both <b>softening</b> and gas exchange had comparable Kin values indicating a common kinetic background. The integrated approach revealed a close quantitative relationship between rate of <b>softening</b> and rate of gas exchange of 'Braeburn' apples indicating that fruit <b>softening</b> is directly metabolically linked to gas exchange.

40|$|Abstract. Experiments {{were carried}} out in which the {{dependence}} of the fractional <b>softening</b> on temperature, time and strain rate was determined in a 304 H stainless steel. Three prestrain ranges were identified pertaining to three different post-deformation <b>softening</b> behaviors: 1) prestraining to below the DRX critical strain: strongly strain dependent <b>softening</b> by SRX alone with <b>softening</b> kinetics controlled by growth rate of the nuclei; 2) prestraining to above the DRX critical strain: SRX + MDRX <b>softening</b> with weaker strain dependence of the kinetics but still controlled by grain growth; 3) at a prestrain of ε* and beyond: nucleation-controlled MDRX <b>softening</b> with the full inhibition of SRX. The transition prestrain ε * can exceed the peak strain if the DRX grain refinement ratio g = D 0 /DDRX> 4. The transition to MDRX-dominated <b>softening</b> {{can be attributed to}} a constant value of the normalized strain hardening rate independent of the preloading temperature and strain rate. The <b>softening</b> data from the compression tests show that at ε*, the time for half <b>softening</b> t 50 exhibits a minimum. These data differ somewhat from observations obtained in the torsion testing of solid bars, in which no strain dependence of t 50 was detected at ε * and beyond. Whether or not the strain dependence of t 50 vanishes in the MDRX range is sensitive to the test method employed to study the post-deformation <b>softening...</b>|$|R
