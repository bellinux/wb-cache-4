50|$|The Tango {{class was}} the NATO {{reporting}} {{name of a}} class of diesel-electric submarines that {{were built in the}} Soviet Union to replace the s assigned to the Black Sea and Northern Fleets. The Soviet designation of this class was Project 641B and it was also known as the <b>Som</b> (<b>Catfish)</b> class. The first of the class was completed in 1972 at Gorky. A total of 18 were built in two slightly different versions. The later type was several metres longer than the first, possibly because of the installation of ASW missile equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Soviets {{assigned}} a project number to each new design. The numbers were non sequential, submarine designs had numbers 600-900, small combatants 100-200 and large ships 1000 plus. The designs also had covernames, major ship classes were named after birds, e.g., Orlan = Sea eagle, Berkut = Golden eagle, Kreschet = Gyrfalcon. Submarine designs were given fish names, e.g., Akula = Shark, <b>Som</b> = <b>Catfish,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|By 25 June, the Imperial Russian Navy had {{purchased}} (in secrecy) its first naval submarine (known as Madam) from Isaac Rice's Electric Boat Company. This submarine was (originally) built {{under the direction}} of Arthur Leopold Busch as the American torpedo boat Fulton. It was a prototype of the (Holland Type 7 Design) known as the Adder-class/ submarines. By 10 October, this first Russian submarine was (officially) commissioned into service (and shipped to) the eastern coast near Vladivostok Russia and was renamed <b>Som</b> or (<b>Catfish).</b> This first Russian submarine was not ready in time for the Russo-Japanese War. The reason behind this delay was partly due to a (late) shipment of torpedoes (that was) originally ordered from Germany in early 1905. Russia soon ordered more submarines (of the same basic design) and they were built under contract with the Holland Company by the Neva Shipbuilding Company located in St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|R
