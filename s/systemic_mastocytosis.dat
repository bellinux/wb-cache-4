50|$|Lymphocyte-variant hyper{{eosinophilia}} is a {{rare disease}} in which eosinophilia is caused by aberrant T cell lymphocytes which secrete cytokines (e.g. interleukin-5) that stimulate the proliferation of eosinophil precursor cells. The disease, which occasionally proceeds to a malignant lymphocytic phase, clearly reflects a clonal disturbance in lymphocytes, not eosinophils, and therefore is not a clonal hypereosinophilia. Similar non-clonal eosinophilia due to eosinophil precursor cell stimulation by clonal malignant cells is sometimes seen in cases of Hodgkin disease, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, T cell leukemias, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other hematological diseases are associated with eosinophilia but regarded as clonal eosinophilia associated with a more important clonal malignancy in another cell type.

Only low levels are detected on the human mast cell sub-line HMC-1.1; however, the HMC-1.2 cell line, which bears a second KIT mutation (D816V, in addition to the V560G mutation found in both HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 cells) that may induce further differentiation, expresses Siglec-8 at the cell surface. However, based on a small sampling of patients, all eosinophils from patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), hypereosinophilic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), all basophils from patients with CEL or CML, and all bone marrow mast cells from patients with indolent <b>systemic</b> <b>mastocytosis</b> or aplastic anemia express Siglec-8, providing a potential target for these cells in the context of these hematologic malignancies.|$|E
50|$|Criteria for the {{clinically}} defined {{diagnosis of}} lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia {{have not been}} strictly set forth.

Criteria for the diagnosis include findings of: a) long term hypereosinophila (i.e. eosinophil blood counts >1,500/microliter) plus physical findings and symptoms associated with the disease; b) bone marrow analysis showing abnormally high levels of eosinophils; c) elevated serum levels of Immunoglobulin E, other immunoglobulins, and CCL17; d) eosinophil infiltrates in afflicted tissues; e) increased numbers of blood and/or bone marrow T cells bearing abnormal immunophenotype cluster of differentiation markers as defined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see above section on Pathogenesis); f) abnormal T cell receptor arrangements as defined by polymerase chain reaction methods (see above section on Pathogenesis); and g) evidence of excessive IL-5 secretion by lymphocytes (see above section on Pathogenesis). In many clinical settings, however, studies on the T cell receptor and IL-5 are not available and therefore not routine parts of the diagnostic work-up or criteria for the disease. The finding of T cells bearing abnormal immunophenotype cluster of differentiation markers is critical to making the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{expressing the}} eosinophil-driving fusion protein {{typically}} present with hypereosinophilia arbitrarily define as blood cell counts containing greater than 1.5x10/liter eosinophils that have persisted {{for more than}} 6 months. However, lower levels of eosinophil counts and/or eosinophilia with a shorter history of duration are not a counter-indication of the diagnoses. These patients also exhibit elevations in their serum levels of Vitamin B12 and tryptase. Elevations of serum VitaminB12 and tryptase are seen regularly in <b>systemic</b> <b>mastocytosis,</b> a disease which may also present with eosinophilia and must be distinguished from FIP1L1-PDGFRA-induced diseases because of the very different treatments for {{the two types of}} diseases. Bone marrow examination may reveal increases in eosinophils and mast cells but usually does not contain elevated numbers of precursor cells or cells with microscopically visible chromosome abnormalities. This examination may be useful in excluding other malignant diseases associated with eosinophilia such as acute myeloid leukemia but does not give definitive results indicating FIP1L1-PDGFRA-induced disease. Rather, definitive results are obtained by detecting the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in the blood and/or bone marrow cells of sufferers by cytogenic analysis using Fluorescence in situ hybridization or nested Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Non-eosinophilic forms of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene-induced diseases are suggested by the presence of morphologically abnormal or excessive numbers of myeloid or lymphoid cells in the blood or bone marrow and, with respect to the lymphoid variants, by the presence of lymphadenopathy and/or lymphoma masses; ultimately, these variants also require demonstration of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion genes fr diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} give rise to: 1) myeloid {{precursor}} cells that differentiate into red blood cells, mast cells, blood platelet-forming megakaryocytes, or myeloblasts, which latter cells subsequently differentiate into {{white blood cells}} viz., neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and eosinophils; or 2) lymphoid precursor cells which differentiate into T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. Malignant transformation of these stem or precursor cells results {{in the development of}} various hematological malignancies. Some of these transformations involve chromosomal translocations or Interstitial deletions that create fusion genes. These fusion genes encode fusion proteins that continuously stimulate cell growth, proliferation, prolonged survival, and/or differentiation. Such mutations occur in hematological stem cells and/or their daughter myeloid precursor and lymphoid precursor cells; commonly involve genes that encode tyrosine kinase proteins; and cause or {{contribute to the development of}} hematological malignancies. A classic example of such a disease is chronic myelogenous leukemia, a neoplasm commonly caused by a mutation that creates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (see Philadelphia chromosome). The disease is due to conversion of the tightly regulated tyrosine kinase of ABL1 protein to being unregulated and continuously active in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia I now successfully treated with maintenance tyrosine kinase inhibitors but before this at the time novel therapeutic approach was generally lethal within 18-60 months of diagnosis. Some hematological malignancies exhibit increased numbers of circulating blood eosinophils, increased numbers of bone marrow eosinophils, and/or eosinophil infiltrations into otherwise normal tissues. These malignancies were at first diagnosed as eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia, acute eosinophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, other myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloid sarcoma, lymphoid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on their association with eosinophils, unique genetic mutations, and known or potential sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other specific drug therapies, they are now in the process of being classified together as clonal hypereosinophilia. Historically, patients suffering the cited eosinophil-related syndromes were evaluated for causes of their eosinophilia such as those due to allergic disease, parasite or fungal infection, autoimmune disorders, and various well-known hematological malignancies (e.g. Chronic myelogenous leukemia, <b>systemic</b> <b>mastocytosis,</b> etc.) (see causes of eosinophilia). Absent these causes, patients were diagnosed in the World Health Organization's classification as having either 1) Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified, (CEL-NOS) if blood or bone marrow blast cells exceeded 2% or 5% of total nucleated cells, respectively, and other criteria were met or 2) idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) if there was evidence of eosinophil-induced tissue damage but no criteria indicating chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Discovery of genetic mutations underlining these eosinophilia syndromes lead to their removal from CEL-NOS or HES categories and classification as myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Informally, these diseases are also termed clonal hypereosinophilias. New genetic mutations associated with, and possibly contributing to the development of, eosinophilia have been discovered, deemed to be causes of clonal eosinophilia, and, in certain cases, recommended for inclusion in the category of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Many of the genetic causes for clonal eosinophilia are rare but nonetheless merit attention because of their known or potential sensitivity to therapeutic interventions that differ dramatically form the often toxic chemotherapy used to treat more common hematological malignancies.|$|E
