500|$|Rae {{ultimately}} learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised {{her response}} as being [...] "shocked and angry", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character [...] "more torn than ever." [...] The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and {{revealed that he}} once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she could be a good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E
500|$|Nineteen months later, Jim is {{a famous}} actor playing {{the title role}} in Richard III at the theatre, using the same, now redecorated, {{dressing}} room. A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him and talks about how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She has watched Jim's performance {{every day of the}} week, and says <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> just needed [...] "a little push" [...] to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not know about this, because he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him [...] "in the wings ... like an understudy". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death.|$|E

2500|$|By 5pm, the {{authorities}} had not delivered {{any amount of}} fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected {{the youngest member of}} the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an atheist. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying [...] "I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.". Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the Quran on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but [...] "nothing like what seemed to be about to happen." [...] French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.|$|E
