50|$|Industrial fishing {{also makes}} an {{important}} contribution to the economy of the region and small-scale artisanal fisheries provide a living for thousands of Angolans and South Africans. In Namibia, more than 20 species are fished commercially and approximately 90% of the catch is exported. The fishing industry employs 13,700 people (2003 figures). There are very few small-scale/artisanal fishers in Namibia, but recreational fishing is a popular sport and a major attraction for coastal tourists. In Angola, at least 25,000 coastal people work as artisanal fishers, while an estimated 80,000 people - mostly women - prepare and sell the artisanal catch and are therefore dependent on fishing for their livelihoods. The South African fishing industry is very diverse. The country’s fishing fleet ranges in size from small rock lobster dinghies, to highly sophisticated freezer trawlers. The <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> for sardine and anchovy is the largest fishery by volume, while the deep-sea trawling industry is the largest by value. This fishery targets the Cape hakes. Artisanal fishers operate along the entire South African coast, harvesting a wide variety of species including linefish, mussels, oysters, ascidians and common periwinkles. Various species of seaweed form the basis of a small industry that produces alginate products and feed for aquaculture operations.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Documentary {{scientific}} evidence supports {{the notion that}} the small pelagics fishery in the Gulf of California does not measurably affect the physical habitat or the functional relationships between the species comprising the pelagic ecosystem. Also, there is little information that suggests any negative effects of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> operations on critically endangered, endemic species, i. e., vaquita and totoaba. Under the current management regime, small pelagics fishery in the Gulf of California has recovered twice from collapses during the last 30 years. Although the small pelagics abundance varies greatly, the long-term productivity of the target species and the structure and function of the pelagic ecosystem are not compromised because the fishery relies on a suitable logistic and administrative platform, which is consistent with international standards for responsible fisheries, precautionary approach and ecosystem-based fisheries management principles...|$|E

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{produce more}} than 25 % {{of the fish}} caught in the ocean. Their {{production}} is mainly dedicated to fish meal and fish oil production (more than 80 %). In this system, there is a tension between a highly variable natural system and a more rigid economic system, with a high increase in demand. To make explicit the stakes of the management of this system, we propose a bioeconomic model, coupling the ecological and economic dynamics. The coupling {{is based on the}} computing of global equilibrium, on the network which interconnects the marine production systems (ecosystems, fisheries and manufacturing) and the fish product markets (fish oil and fish meal) all around the world. This model allows the consequences of several management hypotheses to be analysed (increase of carrying capacity of ecosystems through climate changes, politics of total allowable catches, etc.). To illustrate the model's behaviour we propose sensitivity analysis of the model results, with changes in specific values. We have derived from this work a dedicated role playing game in which players are not the stakeholders directly involved in the fishery business, but their delegates: South American, or European fisheries and industries, fish meal or fish oil buyers from Europe or China, scientific institutions studying the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, international organisations from the Pacific or Europe.

40|$|This note {{deals with}} a {{harvesting}} model for a single stock fishery. In the case of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish {{it seems reasonable to}} consider harvest functions depending nonlinearly on fishing effort and on fish stock. Empirical evidence about these fish species suggests that marginal catch does not necessarily react in a linear way to changes in fishing effort and fish stock levels. This is in contradiction with traditional fishery models where catch-to-input marginal productivities are normally assumed to be constant. While allowing for non linearities in both catch-to-effort and catch-to-stock parameters, this note extends the traditional analysis by focusing on the dependence of the stationary solutions upon the nonlinear catch-to-biomass parameter. Given the emphasis on the case of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish, the analysis considers positive but small values for the catch-to-stock parameter. <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries,</b> harvesting functions, Cobb-Douglas production function, optimal control, maximum principle. ...|$|R

Dolphins and seals are also killed in fishing gear in Australian fisheries, particularly purse seine and trawl fisheries.

The total fishing effort was higher than EMSY and the fish stock was likely over-exploited since 2000. To ensure the optimal fish production of the small pelagic fish stock in the Java Sea, it is necessary to recover fish stock by controlling fishing effort to EMSY.

40|$|Fishery {{management}} {{is a complicated}} task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of shared fish stocks is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem.

However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions.

This general scientific background is intended to provide {{a summary of the}} fisheries science underpinning management. Background – International scientific standards for sustainable fisheries on small pelagic fish species Several groups of scientists worldwide, including from CSIRO and IMAS, have recently examined the effects of fisheries on small pelagic species (also sometimes called forage fish) and how they should be managed so as to avoid undesirable flow-on effects of these fisheries on the food web and ecosystem. There is now clear and widely agreed understanding about how these fisheries should be managed, and this understanding has a strong scientific basis (e. g. Smith et al. 2011).

The <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> in Alas Strait is mainly targeted upon squid (mostly Loligo edulis) by means of ‘jala-oras ’ (payang-type) fishing, which is also used to catch small pelagic fishes during squid-off season. The small pelagic catches consist primarily of lemuru (Sardinella lemuru), tembang (Sardinella fimbriata), layang scad (Decapterus spp), and kembung (Rastrelliger spp), which are usually taken by various pelagic fishing gears.

Squid catches increased steadily from < 100 t to 1, 700 t prior to 1978 due to “jala-oras ” boat motorization, but fluctuated sharply afterward.

Catch and effort (trip) data between 2004 and 2011 from the three landing sites were used to estimate Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) using Schaefer & Fox models. The results showed a decreasing trend in the catch rate, from 30. 83 tons/trip in 2004 to 12. 27 tons/trip in 2011. The estimated MSY is at the range of 34, 705 - 37, 930 tons with optimum efforts for 2, 234 - 2, 500 purse seine trips. Thus the level of purse seine fishing effort in 2011, i. e. 3, 078 trips, was exceeding the optimum effort. The decreasing trend in the catch rate may indicate overfishing is occurring between 2004 and 2011. For management of the small pelagic fisheries {{in the waters of}} Makassar Strait, important action recommended is fishing effort restrictions.

Analysis of catch and effort data of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries</b> by using the surplus yield model was done to obtain information on the likely trend of CPUE for the last ten years. By using the pajeko as the standardized fishing gear the trend of CPUE has been calculated. Between 2000 - 2005, the trend of production (catch), effort and CPUE followed the general pattern of the exploited fisheries that already fully exploited, where the increasing trend of effort was not followed by the increasing catch. On the other hand, the trend of CPUE is decreased. In the following years, the trend of both catch and CPUE do not follow the general pattern of the exploited fisheries.

This model reproduces the biological and economic conditions in which the fisheries occur. Starting from an initial condition (2004), the simulation model incorporates the biological and economic processes of the resources and the fishing fleet and computes the most probable future trajectory of the system under different management conditions. We analysed the projection of selected indicators (biomass, recruitment, catches, profits) under four different management scenarios based on effort control, and we assessed the performance of these management measures against the current situation. The four scenarios were: i) increase in fuel price, ii) reduction in fuel price, iii) limiting the number of days at sea, and iv) extending the fishing period. Each management event was introduced in the third year of the simulation. For each scenario a stochastic simulation was carried out. Our results show that the impact of each management measure tested was not homogeneous across the fleet. In particular, comparatively smaller vessels generally display narrower profit margins and tend to be more sensitive to negative shocks, reinforcing the idea that management measures should be calibrated by stratifying the fleet before implementation...|$|R

The simulations show {{that as a result of}} competition between fisheries per zone there can only be one winner in the general case. Nevertheless there is also an arising case that allows an operational management of shared fisheries by acting on the cost of fishing unit effort, indeed we found that a large number of equilibrium exist. From this last case the initial distribution of fishing effort strongly impact the optimal equilibrium that can be reached. Lastly the model report that the country with the highest carrying capacity density may get less landings when collaborating with other countries than if it minimise its fishing costs.

The fisheries target small pelagics, demersal fish and shrimps, and were chosen for their major contribution to the total Eritrean catch, economic importance or a significant contribution to unreported catch. Using an adaptation of the method of Pitcher et. al., (2002), the analysis is carried out for the period 1950 – 2004, subdivided into blocks of 5 years. Factors that provide incentives to fishers to misreport are obtained by examining the historical development of the fisheries; analysis is based on interpolations, guided by these incentives, between independent quantitative estimates of unreported catch (“anchor points”). Errors are obtained from a Monte Carlo sampling technique. The fishery industry in Eritrea operated smoothly from the mid 1950 s to the end of 1960 s, when it was disrupted by political instability: fishing operations were normalized again {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s.

The total mortality coefficient (Z) and the fishing mortality (F) of the black pomfret were at high levels, the exploitation ratio (E) was over 0. 5, {{and the number of}} captured juvenile fishes showed that the stock of black pomfret in this area was overexploited and improper fishing gear was utilized.

The growth coefficient k increased and age at the inflexion point of weight t r was younger than before. The smaller change of the fork length at first maturity of the two fishes has indicated a more vulnerable fishery ecosystem in this area. Therefore, in addition to the traditional fishery management approach, such as taking the minimum length into consideration, ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF) should be taken to improve the practical fishing management, including conserving the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fishery</b> population in order to achieve the sustainable fishing of the stocks...|$|E

With five age groups of each, the dominant black pomfret was one year, while frigate tuna was two years. The total mortality coefficient (Z) and the fishing mortality (F) of the black pomfret were at high levels, the exploitation ratio (E) was over 0. 5, {{and the number of}} captured juvenile fishes showed that the stock of black pomfret in this area was overexploited and improper fishing gear was utilized. Compared with previous studies, the maximum and mean fork length, body weight and age of the two fishes declined gradually, the populations were younger in age and smaller in size. The growth coefficient k increased and age at the inflexion point of weight t(r) was younger than before. The smaller change of the fork length at first maturity of the two fishes has indicated a more vulnerable fishery ecosystem in this area.

40|$|The Humboldt Current Ecosystem (HCE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} systems in the world. The interannual and interdecadal ocean-atmospheric variations in the Southeast Pacific (SEP) have recognized impacts on the HCE fisheries, especially during El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. To understand how anthropogenic climate change might affect HCE fisheries, the changes in teleconnections between the Peru/Chile coasts and the Pacific Ocean under these circumstances were investigated. Sea-surface temperature (SST) from the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) under the IPCC pre-industrial, 20 th century and two future GHG scenarios were obtained to study these effects, by creating indices to identify the teleconnections. We use EOFs to identify the warming trend spatial patterns, which are then removed to form detrended SST anomalies (SSTA) in order to examine ENSO statistics on a changing background state. We find an increase in the amplitude of the interannual SSTA in the Nino 3. 4 region and along the coast of the SEP in the PCM IPCC runs, corroborated with observations from the HADISST data set. Atmospherically forced ENSO teleconnections broaden latitudinally and expand poleward under the influence of the trends in the background ocean-atmosphere state, independently from the IPCC scenario and the period of analysis. Under GHG forcing, there is a significant increase in correlations between the Equatorial Pacific and the SEP coast, especially in a region off Central / South Chile, indicating a poleward expansion of an "ENSO-like" pattern. Based on their historical responses to environmental variations, the possible effects of global warming on the HCE's <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> <b>fisheries</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{regionalization}} {{methods in}} fisheries based on provinces or major fishing areas, includes large and arbitrary grids in which basic statistics or inferences on distribution or abundance are made. We describe {{a method for}} regionalization and analysis of fishing activities for <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the Gulf of California, based on spatial patterns of landing and catch data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. A fisheries database from logbooks with spatial attributes from October 2002 to June 2007 was analyzed. Landings and catching data were transformed to a Weighted Region Index (WRI) by using fuzzy logic operators. The WRI revealed fishing action centers characterized by areas with the highest WRI values, and a hierarchy for {{the relative importance of}} the regions was established. Guaymas, Desemboque de Caborca, Isla Patos, and Bahía San Rafael were the most prominent ones. An analysis of the relative frequency of species composition showed that the Pacific sardine had over 80 % abundance in the midriff islands, and remained as the most important in the upper gulf regions, while in {{the central part of the}} gulf, relative abundances of Pacific sardine and Northern anchovy were more balanced. Relative abundance of mackerel was significantly larger around Isla Patos than in any other place. Guaymas had the largest relative composition of Northern anchovy and the lowest values for Pacific sardine. Desemboque de Caborca showed the largest homogeneity in species relative composition. It is important to highlight that this results come from in situ data, while the results previously reported come from landing statistics by port. Therefore, the present method acknowledges the spatial differences of species by regions, additional to the traditional time series analysis...|$|R
40|$|Solomon Islanders {{are highly}} {{dependent}} on their coastal resources for food and livelihoods. Parts of some islands are now quite densely populated and some groups {{are being forced to}} adapt to resource scarcities. One such adaptation is the relatively recent development of nocturnal <b>fisheries</b> for <b>small</b> coastal <b>pelagic</b> fish in Langalanga Lagoon, Malaita Province, in tandem with declining reef fish stocks. The technique involves using lights to attract fish to gill nets and strike-lines deployed from dugout canoes anchored in and around lagoon passages. In the first detailed study of a fishery based on this gear combination in the Pacific, we report a mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from over 190 light fishing trips of 3. 41 kg/hr/person. This figure is two to five times higher than CPUE's obtained for reef-associated fisheries in Solomon Islands, including sites with much lower population and market pressures. The main targets of the light fishery were clupeids, along with small carangids, small sphyraenids and small scombrids. Interviews with fishers revealed there were regular seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of the dominant species (Amblygaster sirm, the Spotted Sardinella) but no long-term (i. e. decadal) variation. Langalanga people now rely heavily on this high-yielding fishery for subsistence and cash, and some said they would need to relocate in search of alternate livelihoods if it did not exist. The high fecundity, rapid growth, early maturation and short life span of the key target species indicate that stocks are likely to be much more resilient than those of most reef-associated species. Many aspects of the behaviour and ecology of the key species remain poorly understood. However we argue that this study should encourage more scientists and fishery managers to think beyond reef-centric and larval connectivity-based models of tropical coastal fishery production and food security, and to pay much closer attention to biological oceanographic processes, including nutrient inputs, which fundamentally underpin the productivity of these increasingly important <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>fisheries.</b> ...|$|R
