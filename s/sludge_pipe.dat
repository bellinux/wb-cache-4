40|$|Industries which pump sludges {{are under}} {{continuous}} pressure to decrease water content, and increase concentration. Environmentally superior disposal techniques {{are demanding that}} such sludges have high mechanical strength properties. This results in a sludge with an increasing viscous character. At high concentration, the viscous forces - which are usually highly non-Newtonian and yield stress in nature - become dominant, and flows inevitably become laminar. The objective {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the effect and evaluate the impact that increasing non-Newtonian viscous stresses - particularly yield stress - have on the pipelining problem. An industrially relevant <b>sludge</b> <b>pipe</b> flow study is presented, demonstrating and quantifying the relationship between sludge rheology and flow regime. It is argued that laminar flow will result in settlable solids accumulating on the pipe invert, leading to pipe blockage. Although some practical remedies have been proposed, this problem requires urgent and focussed research...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} work, non-Newtonian {{properties}} of activated sludge are investigated using a bench test device specially {{developed for the}} purpose of this work. This set-up consists in a bioreactor equipped with a helical ribbon impeller (HRI configuration), and a recirculation loop of the <b>sludge</b> (<b>pipe</b> flow (PF) configuration). The HRI configuration is equipped with a motor and a torque-meter allowing in situ determination of sludge rheogram under stirred reactor conditions. On the PF configuration, differential pressure and flow transducers are implemented, allowing in situ determination of sludge rheogram under piping conditions. Both configurations are then compared. The yield stress, flow and consistency indexes of sludge suspensions (Herschel–Bulkley rheological law coefficients, τy, K and n) are determined over a large range of total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, (12 – 38 g L− 1) in the laminar flow regime. The analysis of experimental data shows that measurements performed with the PF configuration have to be corrected in order to take into account a wall slip phenomenon. A correction model is proposed that shows that slip mechanism is mostly due to wall static depletion at low solid concentrations (12 – 17 g L− 1), then turns to shear induced migration effect at higher solid concentrations (26 – 38 g L− 1) ...|$|E

Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and 72 [...] scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six <b>sludge</b> <b>pipes</b> running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top [...] per second—more than 50 times the flow of the Rio Grande.|$|R
40|$|Effluent streams {{from the}} Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) will {{transfer}} to the tank farms and to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). These streams will contain entrained solvent. A {{significant portion of the}} Strip Effluent (SE) pipeline (i. e., acid stream containing Isopar{reg_sign} L residues) length is within one inch of a sludge stream. Personnel envisioned the sludge stream temperature may reach 100 C during operation. The nearby SE stream may receive heat from the sludge stream and reach temperatures that may lead to flammability issues once the contents of the SE stream discharge into a larger reservoir. To this end, personnel used correlations from the literature to estimate the maximum temperature rise the SE stream may experience if the nearby sludge stream reaches boiling temperature. Several calculation methods were used to determine the temperature rise of the SE stream. One method considered a heat balance equation under steady state that employed correlation functions to estimate heat transfer rate. This method showed the maximum temperature of the acid stream (SE) may exceed 45 C when the nearby sludge stream is 80 C or higher. A second method used an effectiveness calculation used to predict the heat transfer rate in single pass heat exchanger. By envisioning the acid and <b>sludge</b> <b>pipes</b> as a parallel flow pipe-to-pipe heat exchanger, this method provides a conservative estimation of the maximum temperature rise. Assuming the contact area (i. e., the area over which the heat transfer occurs) is the whole pipe area, the results found by this method nearly matched the results found with the previous calculation method. It is recommended that the sludge stream be maintained below 80 C to minimize a flammable vapor hazard from occurring...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{properties}} of heterogeneous sewage sludges {{are dependent on}} solids concentration and <b>sludge</b> type. General <b>pipe</b> flow design methods for sewage sludge applications are therefore unreliable. The non-Newtonian (pseudoplastic) and time-dependent (thixotropic) influence on the rheological characteristics of raw sludge was determined experimentally. These characteristics were used as basis to develop an empirical method to determine the head losses in pressure <b>pipes</b> conveying these <b>sludges</b> under laminar flow conditions. The method is illustrated {{by means of a}} design example...|$|R
50|$|Like in sludging, the {{drilling}} process is continuous: the drill bit is normally not {{removed from the}} borehole until it is finished and the broken-up material is pumped to the surface in {{the drilling}} liquid (mud). But instead of using a hand as a valve {{on top of the}} drill <b>pipe</b> (<b>sludging),</b> the drill bit itself doubles as a foot-valve. The operator’s hand does not have to reach the end of the drill pipe and drill stem extensions can be several meters long.|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of data is {{analysed}} {{of the flow of}} concentrated sewage <b>sludge</b> through straight <b>pipes.</b> Mathematical models are obtained of the laminar and turbulent flow of each main category of sewage sludge. The sludges are modelled as time-independent, non-Newtonian relations between shear stress, rate of shearing strain, and solids concentration. Due to the inhomogeneity of sewage sludge, error analysis becomes pivotal to the data analysis, and options are examined for reducing the error of each model with one or more user-fitted parameters. Parameter estimation is discussed for viscous, time-independent, non-Newtonian, laminar and turbulent flow models. Due to extensive requirements of the data analysis, the parameter estimation methods are robust, and generally suitable for any shear flow relation. The difficulties of estimating parameters of shear flow models from pipe flow data are addressed. Numerical algorithms are presented for modelling the flow of time-independent, non-Newtonian, viscous fluids through a straight pipe. Laminar, critical and turbulent flow algorithms are developed to offer predictions such as pressure gradient, mean cross-sectional velocity, and the velocity distribution. To handle the requirements of the data analysis, the algorithms impose few restrictions on the type of shear flow relation, the flow velocity, and the pipe diameter. Suitable pipe flow equations are chosen, and are manipulated mathematically into forms that would yield robust and efficient schemes. The appropriate use of numerical methods for the algorithms is investigated. Mathematical models of sludge are for use by the sewage industry to give an idea of the flow behaviour of sludges for any relevant application. The parameter estimation techniques and pipe flow algorithms are not constrained to any particular pipe, fluid or flow conditions, so they would be useful for any relevant application...|$|R
40|$|Urine {{separation}} is a complementary function to the sewage system. Some {{people believe that}} it {{is the best way to}} close the cycle of nutrients between urban and rural areas. In order to study the experiences of the users of urine separating sewage systems an inquiry was made among such users in five different housing districts. Three districts were equipped with the DS-toilet from WM-Ekologen AB. The other two districts were equipped with the toilet Dubbletten from BB-Innovation & Co AB. In the inquiry the users were asked about odour, cleaning, design of the toilets and how they handled toilet paper after urination. Other questions treated the users opinion of urine separation toilets and the future of the system. A purpose of the inquiry was to find out how often the urine pipe got blocked, what the blockages consisted of and how hard they were to clear. The inquiry showed that urine separation toilets smelled just a little more then conventional ones. Some families had initially had large odour problems. This was often a result of faulty installation and when the installation was fixed, the odour had disappeared. However, a few families still found that the urine separating toilets smelled somewhat more than conventional ones. The difference was small and thus odour was not a large problem. Of the two studied urine separating toilets, one required more cleaning and one less than a conventional toilet. One problem was that faeces frequently got stuck onto the porcelain. The flushing of the urine bowl of the toilet did not function well on either of the toilets. This should not be difficult to improve, but product development is required. The users were asked to grade their confidence in a future expansion of urine separating sewage systems using grades from one to six. Grade one meant that the system did not have a future and grade six meant that it would become widespread. The average grades of the users in the different districts were between 4,l an 4, 6. The majority was also positive to having urine separating toilets in their homes, average grades were above 5, 4 in all districts except one, Palsternackan, where the average was 4, 9. The most serious problem with the urine separating toilets was the frequent blockages of the urine pipe on the toilet itself. Most of the blockages, 77 % of the ones studied, originated from hair or straws from toilet brushes. These blockages were easy to clear. However, there were also a few blockages that were impossible to clear with our equipment. These blockages consisted of a hard precipitation containing large proportions of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and, where the urine pipe was of copper, also copper. The inquiry showed that after 4 000 estimated toilet usages only three households, out of 96, had not had any blockage of the urine pipe. In two districts the pipes of the urine sewage system were further investigated. Where the pipe had a diameter on ll 0 mm and a slope of 1 cm per meter, there was almost no <b>sludge</b> in the <b>pipes</b> and no sign of any future blockage problem. Pipes with a diameter of 50 mm and pipes with less slope than l % contained much sludge. The sludge was easy to flush away with water. We regret that it was not possible to make any observation of pipes with diameters between 50 and 110 mm having a l % slope...|$|R
