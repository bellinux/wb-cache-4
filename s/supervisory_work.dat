40|$|Perfectionism in the {{counselor}} trainee {{has the potential}} to undermine counseling self-efficacy and relationships with client and supervisor (Arkowitz, 1990). Perfectionism is defined as “a predilection for setting extremely high standards and being displeased with anything less” (Webster’s II New College Dictionary, 1995, p. 816). In this study, 143 counselor trainees and 46 supervisors (46 supervisor-trainee dyads) completed surveys designed to assess the relationships between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism and counseling self-efficacy, the working alliance between supervisor and trainee, as well as the working alliance between trainee and client. Trainee participants completed the Almost Perfect Scale – Revised (Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, 2 ̆ 6 Ashby, 2001), the Self-Efficacy Inventory (Friedlander 2 ̆ 6 Snyder, 1983), the <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory – Trainee Version (Efstation, Patton 2 ̆ 6 Kardash, 1990) and the Working Alliance Inventory – Short Form Therapist Version (Horvath, 1991). Supervisor participants completed the <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory – Supervisor Version (Efstation, Patton 2 ̆ 6 Kardash, 1990). Results indicated that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with working alliance between trainee and client (r = -. 261, p =. 002) and positively correlated with the working alliance between supervisor and trainee (from the perspective of the supervisor, r = -. 345, p =. 019). Results also demonstrated evidence for counseling self-efficacy as a significant moderator between adaptive perfectionism and the supervisory working alliance (from the perspective of the trainee) and between maladaptive perfectionism and the supervisory working alliance (from the perspective of the supervisor). Supervisors should consider perfectionism in counselor trainees as this may affect counseling self-efficacy and working alliances between supervisor and trainee as well as between trainee and client...|$|R

50|$|Forensic {{psychotherapy}} is {{the application}} of psychological knowledge {{to the treatment of}} patients who have mental illnesses who commit violent acts against others or themselves involving both the conscious and unconscious motivations. Commonly applied diagnoses would include personality disorder and psychosis. The link between personality disorder and offending is not firmly established although many of those who commit offences have one or more personality disorders. The term forensic psychotherapy is usually associated with Psychodynamic psychotherapy, including group psychotherapy and the therapeutic community approach. Cognitive behavioral therapy is more commonly associated with the field of psychology, particularly Forensic Psychology. Forensic psychotherapists may collaborate with other professionals, such as physicians, social workers, and other psychologists to best serve the client's needs and may work in various settings including prisons, inpatient settings, and outpatient settings. Forensic psychologists encompasses four types of work: clinical work, <b>supervisory</b> <b>work,</b> clinical meetings, and consultation.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} percentage of non-mainstream (e. g., ethnically diverse) individuals studying and practicing psychology, research {{on race and}} ethnicity is critical towards understanding their role in professional development. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of incorporating discussions of racial attitudes and culture in counseling supervision. Racial and ethnic identities have been suggested as potential facilitators or inhibitors in supervisory relationships. Racial identity (RI) development {{has been found to}} be related to supervisors 2 ̆ 7 and supervisees perceptions of the supervisory working alliance. Supervisory dyads where both the supervisor and the supervisee have high levels of RI development have been found to have the strongest supervisory working alliance (i. e., most satisfied with the relationship). Conversely, dyads in which both members have low levels of RI development have been found to be the least satisfied with their relationship (Bhat 2 ̆ 6 Davis, 2007; Ladany, Brittan-Powell, 2 ̆ 6 Pannu, 1997). This study examined whether similar relationships exist between ethnic identity (EI) development and the supervisory working alliance. The sample included 164 participants, 68 supervisors and 96 supervisees. Analyses on supervisory dyads included 64 dyads, 57 supervisors and 60 supervisees. All participants completed the Ethnic Identity Scale to measure their level of El development. Supervisors and supervisees in supervisory dyads were assigned to interaction groups based on their level of EI development. Supervisors completed the <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory and supervisees completed the <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory - Trainee Version to measure the working alliance in counselor supervision. Results revealed that supervisors and supervisees did not differ significantly in their level of EI development. There was a significant difference found between supervisors and supervisees level of El affirmation (i. e., their feelings toward their ethnicity). In contrast to prior findings with RI development, a relationship was not found between EI development and the supervisory working alliance. Reliance on supervisor/supervisee self-report rather than their perceptions of each other 2 ̆ 7 s EI development may have contributed to disparate findings. In order to obtain less biased data, future studies should include participants 2 ̆ 7 assessments on all of their supervisory relationships instead of allowing them to self-select individual supervisors/supervisees. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{there has}} been some {{research}} investigating supervisee satisfaction with the supervisory working alliance, there is a dearth of research from the supervisor perspective. Registered supervisors with the Queensland Registration Board participated on an online survey investigating aspects of the supervisory working alliance. Some of the measures used were the <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory (SWAI) and Satisfaction with Supervision Questionnaire (SWSQ). In making their assessments supervisors were asked to think of one of their supervisees. Fifty-five supervisors (19 males and 36 females) whose ages ranged from 28 to 80 years of age responded. Supervisor's overall satisfaction with supervision was very high. There was no significant relationship between supervisor satisfaction with supervision and the overall SWAI score. However, a significant positive relationship was observed between satisfaction and the identification scale of the supervisory working alliance inventory, but not rapport and client focus. Supervisors could be judging the alliance in terms of the supervisee's performance rather than their own. There {{were no significant differences between}} male and female supervisors in their ratings of the supervision scales.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how trainee {{attachment to the}} supervisor {{is related to the}} supervisory working alliance and to disclosure in supervision. Counselors-in-training (N = 480) completed the (a) Attachment to Supervisor Scale, (b) <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Working</b> Alliance Inventory-Trainee, and (c) Disclosure in Supervision Scale. Structural equation modeling tested the following hypotheses: (a) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher levels of disclosure in supervision, mediated by the Rapport (i. e., bond) and Client Focus (i. e., goals and tasks) components of the supervisory working alliance; (b) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher ratings of the Rapport component of the supervisory working alliance; and (c) Supervisee secure attachment to the supervisor would be associated with higher ratings of the Client Focus component of the supervisory working alliance. The best fitting model indicated that higher attachment security is related to increased disclosure, partially mediated by the supervisory working alliance. Higher attachment security was also associated with higher levels of Rapport and Client Focus. The results suggest that trainee disclosure can be increased by facilitating increased attachment security and Rapport, and provide {{a better understanding of the}} learning relationship that forms between trainees and their supervisors. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades has {{witnessed}} a strong endorsement of competency-based models for both practitioner training and professional supervision. The valid and reliable measurement of supervisee and supervisory competence is an essential step towards progress, yet currently there are few instruments that can claim to measure the range of supervisor competencies. The current study establishes the Supervision Evaluation and Supervisory Competence (SE-SC) scale as a new, psychometrically sound instrument. Method: A total of 142 supervisees anonymously completed overall evaluations of supervision satisfaction and supervisor effectiveness and of specific supervisor competencies using the SE-SC instrument. The specific competencies were subjected to a hierarchical cluster analyses to determine the underlying structure of supervisory competence. Results: The results supported a six-cluster solution that included (a) Openness, caring and support, (b) Supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s Knowledge and Expertise as Therapist, (c) Supervision Planning and Management, (d) Goal-Directed Supervision, (e) Restorative Competencies, and (f) Insight into and Management of Therapist-Client Dynamics and Reflective Practitioner Competencies.
