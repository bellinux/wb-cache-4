50|$|Shopping {{consumer}} goods are the goods which take {{lot of time}} and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. <b>Shopping</b> <b>goods</b> are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.|$|E
50|$|Consumer goods can be {{categorized}} into convenience goods, <b>shopping</b> <b>goods,</b> and speciality goods. The classification scheme {{is based on the}} way consumers purchase. This system is based on the definition that convenience and speciality goods are both purchased with a predetermined pattern in mind. In the case of the convenience good, the pattern is that the most accessible brand will be purchased; {{in the case of a}} speciality good, the pattern is that only a specific brand will be purchased. For example, if the customer utilizes an outlet because it is the most accessible, it would be considered, for that customer at least, a convenience store; while one in which the consumer shops even if he/she has to go considerably out of his/her way to reach it, would be considered a speciality store. A shopping good is one in which the consumer does not have a predetermined pattern in mind. Likewise a shopping store is one which the consumer will undertake a search to select a store to patronize.|$|E

He had charges pending in the United States that could have meant spending a life behind bars, but Pérez {{wanted to make a}} deal. Behind close doors and with a tape-recorder, the Customs and FBI began the interrogation that lasted until sunrise the next morning. According to the FBI, Pérez talked about García Ábrego's personal life: his tales of assassinations, bribes, love affairs, and recollections of García Ábrego in tears. He also drew photographs identifying García Ábrego and pinpointed with a map some of the ranches, businesses, and houses he owned in the northern states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. As federal agents pressed him for details, Pérez declared that García Ábrego liked drinking tequila and Carta Blanca beer, preferred boots with zippers, always wore a V-neck T-shirt, and followed baseball, the sport he played {{when he was a young}} boy. He also described how García Ábrego used to buy <b>shopping</b> <b>goods</b> in McAllen, Texas - as much as US$80,000 - for Mexican officials and their families. While García Ábrego usually made deals, he was also described as a short-tempered man who was not hesitant to kill people that stood in his way. Reportedly, he once ordered his bodyguards to kill his mistress' ex-lover because he would not leave her alone. He also allegedly killed the former boyfriend of one of his three sisters for always calling his family's house number and murdered an air-conditioning repairman for failing to fix a newly installed unit. True or false, Pérez's stories were in line with García Ábrego's [...] "allegations of bloodshed." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{model of the}} equilibrium spatial market area and price for a single <b>shopping</b> <b>good</b> is extended to the case where the consumer devotes some income to a nonshopping (outside) good or to obtaining leisure. The presence of an outside good, which does not incur transport or inventory costs, is shown to affect the market area and price of the <b>shopping</b> <b>good</b> according to the relative preference between the goods. The price of the outside good {{has no effect on}} the market area and equilibrium price of the <b>shopping</b> <b>good</b> when the utility function is of a simple Bergson type. The generalization to a model where leisure is a source of utility, and where shopping time and working time reduce the amount of leisure, yields richer results. In particular, not only do relative preferences affect the price and market area for the <b>shopping</b> <b>good,</b> but also the wage rate affects demands and prices. Variations in the time required to travel to the shop and the time needed to do the shopping are shown to have opposite effects on the equilibrium market area and prices. Numerical calculations of elasticities of market areas and prices show that variations in all time-related parameters have an important impact and hence should not be ignored in modelling the factors which determine the size of a spatial market. ...|$|R

50|$|Retailers, like Walmart and Target, buy {{the product}} from the {{manufacturer}} {{and sell them}} directly to the consumer. This channel works best for manufacturers that produce <b>shopping</b> <b>goods</b> like, clothes, shoes, furniture, tableware, and toys. Since consumers need more time with these items before they decide to purchase them, {{it is in the}} best interest of the manufacturer to sell them to another user before it gets into the hand of the consumers. It is also a good strategy to use another dealer to get the product to the end-user if the producer needs to get to the market more quickly by using an established network that already has brand loyalty. In accordance with the form of the retail property, operators can be an independent company, owned by a different owner or to engage in the retail network. Intermediaries (retail service) are essential and useful due to its professionalism, an ability to offer products to the target market, using their connections in the industry, experience, the advantages of specialization and the high quality of work. The fact suggests that manufactories produce large goods and products but limited in its assortment and merchandise. However, consumers seek broader assortment in lesser quantities. Therefore, it is highly important to distribute goods from different manufacturers to suit consumers needs and wants. When creating a retail store the efforts that required by buyers when making a purchase are considered. For example, stores that selling everyday consumer goods are conveniently located for residents of the nearby neighborhood. The speed and convenience of service for clients’ interests are put in high priority and suits their schedule. An equally important component of the retail trade are the retail functions that play crucial roles and they include; research of products, implementation of storage, setting of pricing policy, arrangements of products and its selection for the creation of different merchandise assortments, exploration of the condition prevailing in the market. This channel is considered to be beneficial if; the volume of pre-sale and post-sale is insignificant, the amount of segments of the market is not enormous, the assortment of goods and products is broad. Ultimately, the significance of intermediaries in distribution business is vital as they help consumers obtain a particular good of a particular brand without unnecessary steps. Thus, mediators play an important role in establishing a correspondence between demand and supply.|$|E
