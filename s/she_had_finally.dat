5|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 {{supplemental}} {{draft in}} late June, Layla was drafted to the Raw brand. On the 7 July episode of Raw, Layla made her debut in a tag team match with Jillian Hall, losing to Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, the latter {{of whom had been}} revealed as the newest member of the Raw brand earlier that night. She soon entered a storyline with Jamie Noble in which Noble attempted to impress her with his matches, only to be squashed by his opponents. On 1 September, Noble was able to defeat William Regal, which impressed Layla. The following week, however, Layla chose to align herself with Regal, after he defeated Noble in a rematch. On the following episode of Raw, Layla reinforced her decision, telling Noble that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> found a worthy man in Regal. Over the next few months, Layla competed only sporadically in matches, spending most of her time managing Regal, and was present at ringside when Regal defeated Santino Marella on 10 November to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. On 5 April, Layla competed in a Divas battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, but the match was won by Santina Marella.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} after their dinner, Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> signed the contract; {{this was the first}} time Ross learned that Rice had {{apparently}} promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during their dinner. Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review the musical and see if there was in fact a moment for which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in the Beast's castle.

500|$|Following Marianna's {{death in}} 1890, it was {{reported}} in French newspapers that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally,</b> on her deathbed and with Edgardo beside her, become a Christian. Edgardo refuted this: [...] "I have always ardently desired that my mother embrace the Catholic faith," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter to Le Temps, [...] "and I tried many times to get her to do so. However, that never happened". A year later, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara returned to Italy for the first time in two decades to preach in Modena. A sister and some of his brothers came out to hear his sermon, and for the rest of his life Edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in Italy. During a 1919 sojourn in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61 years before. By this time he had settled at the abbey of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in Liège, Belgium. Bouhay had a sanctuary to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a special connection, the Lourdes apparitions of 1858 having occurred in the same year as his own conversion to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara resided at Bouhay for the rest of his life and died there on 11 March 1940, at the age of 88.|$|E

500|$|Originating from New Jersey, Angelina {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin {{to be with}} her father Angelo. She also wanted to fulfill her new-found dreams of {{becoming}} a recording artist. Her father hired music producer Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) to create her music. However, it was soon evident that she lacked in talent. She developed a crush on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), which she takes to extreme heights, conning him into a short-lived marriage {{with the help of her}} father. Angelina eventually achieved her musical dream, having released a song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] which was written and produced by DeGarmo. The song was about how the character evolved into a better person when she left, and detailed her [...] "emotional journey". DeGarmo said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> gotten rid of her selfish ways and expressed this through music. After a five-month stint on the series, on March 27, 2012, Angelina left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles. Described as [...] "mafia princess" [...] and an alter ego, TV Guide credited her as being comedic relief for the daytime drama.

500|$|M.I.A. {{has become}} known for {{integrating}} her imagery of political violence into her music videos and her cover art. Her politically inspired art became recognised while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of Tamil nationalism, ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on Arular regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists. The album references the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Tamil independence movements and features culture jamming, multi-lingual slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums' social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the [...] "invigoratingly complex" [...] politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the West was engaged in the 2003 Iraq War in the Middle East during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Government visits to her official website following her debut album's release in 2005, and a US refusal to grant M.I.A. a travel visa coupled with her brief presence on the US Homeland Security Risk List in 2006 due to her politically charged lyrics led to her second album Kala being recorded {{in a variety of}} locations around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described the actions as part of a trend of ideological exclusion by the state which was detrimental to democracy by [...] "censoring and manipulating debate". In October 2016, she revealed on her Instagram that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> been approved for a US visa.|$|E
500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a white lab coat {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them to change their minds about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop). In [...] "Summer Belongs To You", Phineas mentions time traveling twice and Isabella comments that Phineas has traveled through time [...] "twice", but because of the events in the credits of Quantum Boogaloo, no-one - including Isabella [...] should actually know about the time-traveling.|$|E
