40|$|Discounting {{has played}} an {{important}} role in forestry economics because harvesting cycles are often much longer than project cycles for other investments.

5000|$|At {{a seminar}} held in 2006, Cambridge {{economist}} Partha Dasgupta {{commented on the}} Stern Review.Dasgupta (2006, p. 1) described the Review as [...] "a long and impressive document," [...] but felt that the authors had treated the issue of intergenerational equity (via the <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate)</b> [...] "cavalierly". Dasgupta (2006, pp. 6-7) accepted the Review's argument for a PTP-rate of 0.1%, but did not accept Stern's choice of 1 for the elasticity of marginal utility. He argued this point by calculating a saving rate of 97.5% based on the Review's values for the PTP-rate and elasticity of marginal utility. Dasgupta stated that [...] "a 97.5% savings rate is so patently absurd that we must reject it out of hand." [...] The calculation by Dasgupta {{was based on a}} model which had a deterministic economy, constant population, and no technological change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{range in}} the <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> for a {{cost-benefit}} analysis in this issue range from zero to over 3%. Some argue {{that the only reason}} for discriminating against future generations is that these generations might cease to exist in the future. Thus the rate of time preference should equal zero since the probability for such a catastrophic event is so low (assumed to be 0.01% per year). This infers that there is equal weight given to all generations. However, to the extent that future generations are likely to be richer than those in the present, a positive discount rate should be applied reflecting the diminishing marginal utility of consumption. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is one such report that argues for zero discrimination of future generations, but applied a range of positive discount rates to its assessment based on the range of consumption projections predicted by climate models at the time. There is an important distinction here between discounting, which is partly a function of expected future consumption paths, and pure time preference, which the rate of discrimination through time. A common misconception is that the Stern Review applied a zero discount rate. In fact, the Stern review's stochastic projections applied many discount rates reflecting a range of consumption projections, all of them positive, even while it took the rate of time preference to be close to zero. This confusion is prevalent. William D. Nordhaus of Yale [...] "examines a model of climate change that is similar to the one used in the Stern Review but with a 3 percent <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> that slowly declines to 1 percent in 300 years rather than the 0.1 percent discount rate used in the Stern Review. In his model, the welfare of future generations is given less weight than the current generation's welfare. He finds that preventive measures like a tax on carbon emissions are certainly required. But they are of a much smaller magnitude than those recommended in the Stern report." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{subject of}} a <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> always a source of fierce debate between economists, has become highly {{controversial}} {{since the publication of}} the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. The publication exploded on the global warming scene in 2006 with its dire warning that global gross domestic product (GDP) was at future risk of a 20% reduction if there was a failure to invest 1% of world GDP now to reduce global warming. The Review did not use a single discount rate, but applied a stochastic approach whereby the discount rate varied with the expected outcomes, reflecting the interaction between growth and the elasticity of marginal utility, in line with Frank Ramsey's growth model. However, critics questioned the findings on the basis that they were partly arrived at using an extremely low pure time preference rate of 0.1% in economic modeling.|$|E
30|$|The {{tradeoff}} between consumption {{utility and}} the disutility from {{the climate change}} which is summarized by the total stock of carbon dioxide is expressed by a utility function. Each generation enjoys consumption, but instead, emits carbon dioxide, and thus the concentration of carbon dioxide occurs. We calculate the optimal proportional carbon tax that prevents the excess emission by using only the information concerning the feasibility condition between consumption and emission independent of the form of utility function. The optimal <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in a planning economy are calculated as the rates by which the economy can attain the same intergenerational resource allocation as that in a market economy where the optimal proportional carbon tax is adopted. We find such an endogenously determined optimal <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is zero.|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{economic}} assessment of large projects is sensitive to assumptions about discounting future costs and benefits. Projects that require high upfront investments and take years to begin producing economic benefits can be difficult to justify with the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> typically used for project appraisal. While most economists argue that <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> should be below 4 %, many international development banks and government planning agencies responsible for project appraisal can be found using rates of 7 - 12 % or more. These agencies justify choosing higher <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> to account for the opportunity cost of capital. Meanwhile, a new and robust debate has begun in economics over whether <b>social</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> of even 3 - 4 % are too high in the context of climate change. This paper reviews the recent discounting controversy and examines its implications for the appraisal of an illustrative hydropower project in Ethiopia. The analysis uses an integrated hydro-economic model that accounts for how the dam’s transboundary impacts vary with climate change. The real value of the dam is found to be highly sensitive to assumptions about future economic growth. The argument for investment is weakest under conditions of robust global economic growth, particularly if these coincide with unfavourable hydrological or development factors related to the project. If however long-term growth is reduced, the value of the dam tends to increase. There may also be distributional or local arguments favouring investment, if growth in the investment region lags behind that {{of the rest of the}} globe. In such circumstances, a large dam can be seen as a form of insurance that protects future vulnerable generations against the possibility of macroeconomic instability or climate shocks...|$|R
