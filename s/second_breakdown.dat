25|$|The Pontifex Maximus {{determined}} when an intercalary {{month was}} to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: {{the first time was}} during and after the Second Punic War. It led to the reform of the 191 Acilian Law on Intercalation, the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The <b>second</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{was in the middle of}} the first century and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected Roman magistrates was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.|$|E

40|$|The Lanczos {{algorithm}} can be {{used both}} for eigenvalue problems and to solve linear systems. However, when applied to non-Hermitian matrices, the classical Lanczos algorithm is susceptible to breakdowns and potential instabilities. In addition, the biconjugate gradient (BCG) algorithm, which is the natural generalization of the conjugate gradient algorithm to non-Hermitian linear systems, has a <b>second</b> source of <b>breakdowns,</b> independent of the Lanczos breakdowns. Here, we present two new results. We propose an implementation of a look-ahead variant of the Lanczos algorithm which overcomes the breakdowns by skipping over those steps where a breakdown or a near-breakdown would occur. The new algorithm can handle look-ahead steps of any length and requires {{the same number of}} matrix-vector products and inner products per step as the classical Lanczos algorithm without look-ahead. Based on the proposed look-ahead Lanczos algorithm, we then present a novel BCG-like approach, the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) method, which avoids the <b>second</b> source of <b>breakdowns</b> in the BCG algorithm. We present details of the new method and discuss some of its properties. In particular, we discuss the relationship between QMR and BCG, showing how one can recover the BCG iterates, when they exist, from the QMR iterates. We also present convergence results for QMR, showing the connection between QMR and the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm, the optimal method in this class of methods.

40|$|When an {{electrical}} potential of order one volt is induced across a cell membrane {{for a fraction}} of a <b>second,</b> temporary <b>breakdown</b> of ordinary membrane functions may occur. One result of such a breakdown is that molecules normally excluded by the membrane can now enter the cells. This phenomenon, generally referred to as electropermeabilization, is known as electroporation when actual pores form in the membrane. This paper presents a unique approach to the measurement of pore formation and closure in anchored mammalian cells. The cells are cultured on small gold electrodes, and by constantly monitoring the impedance of the electrode with a low-amplitude AC signal, small changes in cell morphology, cell motion, and membrane resistance can be detected. Because the active electrode is small, the application of a few volts across the cell-covered electrode causes pore formation in the cell membrane. In addition, the heat transfer is very efficient, and the cells can be porated in their regular growth medium. By this method, the formation and resealing of pores due to applied electric fields can be followed in real time for anchorage-dependent cells...|$|R
40|$|The Least Trimmed Squares (LTS) {{estimator}} is a {{frequently used}} robust estimator of regression. When {{it comes to}} inference for {{the parameters of the}} regression model, the asymptotic normality of the LTS estimator can be used. However, this is usually not appropriate in situations where the use of robust estimators is recommended. The bootstrap method constitutes an alternative, but has two major drawbacks. First, since the LTS in itself is a computer-intensive estimator, the classical boot- strap can be extremely time-consuming. And <b>second,</b> the <b>breakdown</b> point of the procedure is lower than that of the estimator itself. To overcome these problems, an alternative bootstrap method is proposed which is both computationally simple and robust. In each bootstrap sample, instead of recalculating the LTS estimates, an approximation is computed using information from the LTS solution in the orig- inal sample. A simulation study shows that this method performs well, particularly regarding confidence intervals for the regression parameters.
