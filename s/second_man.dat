5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have been from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a <b>second</b> <b>man</b> went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns. The island of Roatán received {{a gust of}} 58mph (93km/h). Farther north and west in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a <b>second</b> <b>man</b> was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Serb {{being the}} {{favourite}} {{to win the}} title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, {{to become the first}} British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahony in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Zersenay became {{only the}} <b>second</b> <b>man</b> (after Paul Tergat) {{to win three}} World Championship medals over three {{different}} surfaces in the same year: winning World Cross Country bronze, 10,000 metres World Championship silver on the track, and gold in road running at the World Half Marathon Championships. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> to walk on the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Desha left Kentucky {{and assumed}} an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he {{traveled}} {{with a man}} named Thomas Early to San Antonio, Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha confessed to the murder after being recognized by a <b>second</b> <b>man</b> from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of a fever. A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children. Later historians have debunked that myth.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{four sets}} {{in three hours}} and forty-three minutes, to win his first US Open title, and thus complete the Career Golden Slam (equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi). He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows, became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface (hard, clay and grass). The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{accession}} of Tiberius, Drusus {{had been}} systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in Illyricum in AD 18, and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in AD 21. In practice {{it was still}} Sejanus who was the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> in the empire and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family, by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented, when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation.|$|E
5|$|When the 1931 season started, {{many critics}} and journalists watched Verity closely {{to see how}} he {{compared}} to Rhodes. Their initial impressions were favourable as Verity took five for 42 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Yorkshire's first match of the season and five for 42 against Cambridge University. Then, in his fifth game, Verity became only the <b>second</b> <b>man,</b> after Alonzo Drake, to take all 10 wickets in a single innings for Yorkshire. Against Warwickshire, on his 26th birthday, Verity took 10 for 36 in the second innings, having taken three wickets in the first innings, to give Yorkshire an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was officially}} Drusus {{who was the}} heir to Tiberius, in practice, it was the Praetorian prefect Sejanus who was the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> in the empire.

At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation.

5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian Open well with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the <b>second</b> <b>man</b> in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a <b>second</b> <b>man</b> with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{first-class}} cricket in the 1927 season, Hammond made an immediate impact, becoming only the <b>second</b> <b>man,</b> after W. G. Grace, to score 1,000 runs in May, traditionally {{the first month of}} the English cricket season. This sequence included another effective performance against Lancashire, regarded by some observers {{as one of the best}} innings ever played. He scored 99 in the first innings and 187 in the second to ensure the match was drawn. He again hooked McDonald effectively, at one point hitting five consecutive fours. Hammond played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's for the first time, although he neither batted nor bowled, as well as two Test trials. Coming close to scoring 1,000 runs in June as well, he finished the season with 2,969 runs, including 12 centuries. His average of 69.04 was the fifth highest in first-class cricket. He won selection for the M.C.C. team that would tour South Africa in the winter and the accolade of being named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
