5000|$|Compression: This stroke {{begins at}} B.D.C, or {{just at the}} end of the <b>suction</b> <b>stroke,</b> and ends at T.D.C. In this stroke the piston {{compresses}} the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>suction</b> <b>stroke</b> of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At {{the same time}} the ball valve on {{the delivery}} line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.|$|E
50|$|These {{consist of}} a {{cylinder}} with a reciprocating plunger. The suction and discharge valves are mounted in {{the head of the}} cylinder. In the <b>suction</b> <b>stroke</b> the plunger retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.Efficiency and common problems: With only one cylinder in plunger pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem. In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other.|$|E
40|$|A new {{principle}} of flow rectification for hybrid synthetic jet actuators is introduced in this paper. As is well known, the flow rectification can be best accomplished {{by means of}} fluidic diodes. Novelty {{of the present study}} are fluidic diodes with two mutually opposed nozzles. Interaction between the periodic jet flows from the nozzles causes a difference between the blowing and <b>suction</b> <b>strokes,</b> resulting in a particularly efficient rectification effect. The distance between the nozzle exits as well as the oscillation frequency were the parameters, which were varied during hot-wire measurements. The combination of those parameters achieving the highest volumetric effciency was identified...|$|R

5000|$|Newcomen took forward Papin's {{experiment}} {{and made it}} workable, although little information exists as to exactly how this came about. The main problem to which Papin had given no solution was {{how to make the}} action repeatable at regular intervals. The way forward was to provide, as Savery had, a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder, providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam, and disposing of the water once it had been condensed. The power piston was hung by chains from the end of a rocking beam. Unlike Savery's device, pumping was entirely mechanical, the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam. The rod descended the mine shaft by gravity and drove a force pump, or pole pump (or most often a gang of two) inside the mineshaft. The <b>suction</b> <b>stroke</b> of the pump was only for the length of the upward (priming) stroke, there consequently was no longer the 30-foot restriction of a vacuum pump and water could be forced up a column from far greater depths. The boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe. Making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer; Newcomen's trade as an [...] "ironmonger" [...] or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge.|$|E

The ‘full’ cavitation model was utilized to study its capability on PD pump cavitation. A set of three plunger speeds were simulated. Using the highest plunger speed, an assessment was made of the effect of 1. 5, 3, 4. 5 and 15  parts per million (ppm) of air mass fraction on pump performance and cavitation. An experimental test rig, replicating the CFD model, was designed and built in order to validate the numerical model and find its weaknesses.

On the other hand the CFD pressure trends calculated appeared stretched along the time axis with respect to the experimental data, and this highlighted issues in the multiphase and cavitation models: the vaporization/condensation rate calculated by CFD did not follow the real dynamics correctly because the non-condensable gas expansion was overestimated. This was seen when comparing the CFD/experimental results where the simulated pressure drop gradient at the beginning of the <b>suction</b> <b>stroke</b> and the pressure peaks as the valve closed exhibited a delay in their occurrence. The simulation results were sensitive to the dissolved air mass fraction as the delay depended on the amount of air dissolved in the water.

It consists of following four strokes: <b>suction</b> or intake <b>stroke,</b> compression stroke, expansion or power stroke, exhaust stroke.

If the piston's <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>strokes</b> occur {{at the same speed}} and liquid is metered out half the time the pump is working, then the overall metering rate averaged over time equals half the average flow rate during the discharge stroke. Some single-piston pumps may have a constant slow piston motion for discharge and a quick retract motion for refilling the pump head. In such cases, the overall metering rate is practically equal to the pumping rate during the discharge stroke.|$|R

5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>strokes</b> are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|R

40|$|The {{call for}} {{environmentally}} compatible and economical vehicles, still satisfying demands for high performance, necessitates immense {{efforts to develop}} innovative engine concepts. In an Internal Combustion Engine the performance, efficiency and emission formation depends on the formation of air-fuel mixture inside the engine cylinder. The fluid flow dynamics {{plays an important role}} for air-fuel mixture preparation to obtain the better engine combustion, performance and efficiency. Due to the extreme conditions inside a typical IC-engine (high combustion temperatures and pressures, precipitation of soot and other combustion products, etc.) experimental techniques are sometimes limited in approaching the above mentioned problem. Alternatively, computer simulations (Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD) offer the opportunity to carry out repetitive parameter studies with clearly defined boundary conditions in order to investigate various configurations. We investigate two important, common fluid flow patterns from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, namely, swirl and tumble motion typical of automotive engines. These two parameters represents the fluid flow behaviors occurred inside combustion chamber which influences the air streams to the cylinder during intake stroke and enhances greatly the mixing of air and fuel to give better mixing during compression stoke.

40|$|The {{potential}} for active control of low Reynolds number boundary layers using synthetic jet generators (SJG) has been established. The {{results from a}} four stage experimental study are presented in which the operational and geometric parameters of a rectangular slot choice SJG are optimised. A time-dependent, analysis of the SJG velocity profile is carried out in quiescent conditions prior to application of the SJG in (i) a nominally zero pressure gradient at plate boundary layer (l. 54 > <l 05), and (ii) a simulated longitudinal pressure gradient, in order to asses {{the impact of the}} device on boundary layer development downstream A piezoelectric driven synthetic jet is used in this study in which the resonance characteristics of an intimal cavity are used to establish a fluid jet. Two characteristic resonance frequencies are identified; the mechanical resonance frequency of the diaphragm (FD), and the acoustic resonance frequency of the cavity (FC). The latter is shown to be the most energy efficient excitation frequency in terms of creating the highest synthetic jet velocity. Since the optimum operational and geometrical parameters are difficult to predict theoretically, a parametric study is presented in which, for a constant slot width (H= 0. 28 mm) and resonance cavity geometry, an optimum slot length (L/H=l 7. 86 ~ 2 l. 43), which creates the highest synthetic jet velocity, can be established. Similarly, for a constant resonance cavity diameter, a narrower resonance cavity results in a higher synthetic jet velocity. Although not a experimental parameter, diaphragm clamping force is also seem to be significant in terms of synthetic jet velocity. When studied in conjunction with a zero-pressure gradient boundary layer - such that the jet exits normal to the surface -the orientation of the rectangular slot relative to the freestream (ß) is seen to result in a flow downstream of the slot which changes from a counter rotating vortex pair (when ß= 0 °) to a single streamwise vortex (when ß= 20 °). Increasing the slot angle beyond 20 ° diminishes the induced vortex structure such that, at ß= 90 °, the effect is similar to a surface obstruction. A time dependent analysis of the synthetic jet velocity profile shows that the jet has a structured fluctuation which, in the longitudinal sense, is strongest in the middle of slot (X/H=O, Y/I-I= 0) and in a plane close to the slot (Z/H= 3). The <b>suction</b> <b>stroke</b> of the synthetic jet is seen to induce a flow in the surrounding air which is identified by measurements at various lateral locations with a single component HWA probe. When a dual diaphragm is used for a SJG, synchronisation of the diaphragm displacement is seen to be important. If the velocity peaks corresponding to each diaphragm occur at a different phase in the excitation cycle, the performance increase attributed to the dual diaphragm operation is reduced. Studies of SJG effectiveness within a 2 D boundary layer subjected to a controlled longitudinal pressure gradient show that activation of the SJG can both trigger laminar-turbulent transition and eliminate a laminar separation bubble. The {{potential for}} low Reynolds number flow control by virtual aeroshaping is therefore demonstrated...|$|E
