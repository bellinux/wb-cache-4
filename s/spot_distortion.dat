40|$|Papaya Ring Spot Virus induces various histopathological {{changes in}} Carica papaya L. The {{morphological}} symptoms induced are ring <b>spot,</b> <b>distortion</b> and mottling symptoms on foliage, stunting in stem, fragile roots and concentric ring and deteriorated fruit. The anatomical studies of 90 days old symptomatic leaf stem and root sample revealed extensive deformation of parenchyma tissues in leaf, poor differentiation of vascular tissue without disintegration, reduced size of xylem cells in roots. The root tissues also showed increased lignifications and reduced protoxylem. Hyperplasia in cells externally visible as ring spots was observed. Hypertrophy in cells due to poor differentiation of secondary tissues caused weak and fragile stem and roots in host.

40|$|This thesis uses several {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} to study {{properties of the}} boundary layer and lower troposphere. For historical reasons, radiosondes are the standard atmospheric sampling technique which other observations are compared against. However, they are limited {{in time and space}} and only provide a 'snapshot' of the atmosphere. Due to the remoteness of many areas in Australia, {{there is a need to}} obtain more meteorological data than the sporadic radiosonde and surface weather station information provide. As a consequence, different ground-based remote sensing systems are used to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of atmospheric sampling. Radar, Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and surface weather data are studied to evaluate their potential for remote sensing. If successful, these techniques could compliment current radiosonde observations and be used in forecasting models. A RASS system was integrated with the two VHF radars at the Buckland Park field site in order to obtain high-resolution temperature profiles of the lower atmosphere. Initial testing showed that the manufacturer's stated orientation of the RASS speakers was incorrect. Changing their orientation increased the power transmitted skyward. RASS echoes were recorded with the Stratosphere-Troposphere radar (ST) RASS system up to 6 km under calm conditions. The Boundary Layer Radar (BLR) measured echoes up to 2. 5 km. An existing acoustic ray-tracing algorithm was expanded into two dimensions and modified for use with the ST radar to allow prediction of the acoustic spot's movement. This facilitated beam-steering of the radar to track the acoustic spot so that it was within a beam. Implementation of this algorithm met with partial success. Beam-steering enabled some RASS measurements to higher altitudes than only using the vertical beam, under meteorologically disturbed conditions. However, the ST radar is still limited by only permitting beam-steering in the cardinal directions. No datasets of sufficient quality were obtainable with either VHF radar, due to acoustic <b>spot</b> <b>distortion</b> and movement. The BLR-RASS coverage was very sensitive to increased wind speeds, due to the small size of the receiving antenna. The Bureau of Meteorology operates a UHF radar in Western Sydney, which also has a RASS capability. A seven day dataset from this radar was used to study the thermodynamics and structure of the boundary layer below 1 km. A strong diurnal temperature component was evident, the strength of which decreased with increasing altitude. Second order parameters such as heat flux and Brunt-Väisälä frequency were calculated and results were in general agreement with the structure of the boundary layer. Comparisons between the UHF radar and two VHF Boundary Layer Radars (one at Adelaide and the other at Sydney airport) revealed a better coverage of wind observations in the lowest 1500 m with the UHF. Above this height, the VHF BLRs measured a greater proportion of winds than the UHF radar. Microwave signals from GPS satellites are delayed in the troposphere due to the effects of water vapour. Certain GPS processing packages calculate this tropospheric delay as a by-product of position determination. Consequently, high temporal resolution estimates of precipitable water vapour (PWV) can be made with GPS. Adelaide-specific regression parameters were derived from the local climatology to increase the accuracy of the GPS PWV. The values of the PWV compared favourably with established radiosonde calculations of water vapour. A study of the passage of a cold front over the Buckland Park field site showed that the changes in water vapour agreed with measurements of other parameters including rainfall and synoptic-scale wind field changes. An annual precipitable water vapour spectrum was dominated by synoptic events, with summer and autumn exhibiting the largest changes in water vapour quantity. Currently, GPS cannot detect the sea-breeze as the uncertainties are too large. Research into real-time estimates of water vapour has shown it to be of sufficient quality for potential use in forecasting models. This is believed to be the first demonstration of real-time GPS feasibility in the Australian region. Two case studies of gravity waves emitted by cold fronts are also presented. VHF BLR data as well as a network of surface Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) were used to determine the wave parameters. Both waves preceded the fronts by at least one hour and propagated perpendicularly to the background wind field. Neither gravity wave event appeared to be associated with observed precipitation. The first event in January 2003 had excellent BLR radar coverage, allowing use of the wind perturbations for wave parameter calculations. However, during the second event (in March 2003), the BLR had a low signal to noise ratio, resulting in large data gaps. This meant that AWS data was relied on for wave parameter calculations. Radar data of insufficient quality resulted in no other waves being identified during other frontal events. In summary, the limits of the VHF-RASS systems were reached during these studies. In their present configurations, the VHF radars are not able to consistently observe temperature profiles. The GPS water vapour measurements and the gravity wave detection from radar wind data demonstrated the success of these techniques for obtaining information. Further investigation of these methods may enable a better understanding of the weather in Australia and potential integration into the observation network. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Uredinia and telia occur on spotted pinnules, and pycnia, aecial uredinia and telia on galled and twisted leaf rachides, twigs and branches. B. gloriosa is similar to Bibulocystis viennotii on Albizia granulosa in New Caledonia in having a macrocyclic life cycle with all spore states, and teliospores with two fertile cells and two cysts. It differs in having aecial urediniospores and urediniospores with uniformly thickened walls and several scattered germ pores, rather than the apically thickened walls and equatorial germ pores of B. viennotii. Teliospores in the two species are similar in size, but those of B. gloriosa have proportionally larger fertile cells and smaller cysts than in B. viennotii.

40|$|Abstract. Expressions are {{developed}} for the flux and polarization of radiation scattered by a spherically symmetric envelope for a central point stellar light source that radiates anisotropically. These are obtained {{in terms of the}} components of the spherical harmonics of the flux anisotropy from the source. Such anisotropy can arise from stellar <b>spots,</b> or from <b>distortion</b> of the star through rotation, pulsation, or magnetic effects. Explicit expressions for the Stokes parameters are obtained {{in the case of an}} ellipsoidal star of uniform surface brightness. It is thus shown that even when the scattering envelope is spherical, observationally significant polarization can arise from stars with physically realistic degrees of distortion. The time dependence of the polarization is computed for models of ellipsoidal stars in the cases of pure rotation, pure pulsation, and both rotation and pulsation...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{structure}} of compounding zoom system, a mathematical model of three component continuous zoon design was proposed. Under the guidance of the model, a compact high zoom ratio continuous zoom optical was designed with medium-wave cooling 15 μm, 640 × 512 staring focal plane array. The system works in the range of 3. 7 ~ 4. 8 μm and F number is 4. By using this model to distribute the optical power, the initial focal point is calculated to obtain the focal length range of 9 ~ 740 mm and the zoom ratio is 80 ×. The whole system used only two kinds of infrared materials of silicon and germanium and eight lenses were used. The system was U-folded by using the secondary imaging and two 45 ° reflecting mirrors, it effectively achieved 100 % cold shield efficiency and controlled the horizontal and vertical dimension. It got the moving lens zoom track and cam curve of each group, and analyzed the continuous zoom optical system from MTF, <b>spot</b> diagram, <b>distortion,</b> narcissus, environment analysis and so on. The design results prove that the zoom system has the advantages of smooth zoom track, great narcissus controlled features and excellent image and it has also been found to apply to infrared imaging system matching with advanced middle wave detector greatly.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{overview}} {{about the use}} of the SESYD dataset for performance evaluation of symbol spotting systems. SESYD is a dataset of synthetic graphics documents containing non-isolated symbols in a real context. These documents are drawings (architectural floorplans and electrical diagrams), bags of symbols (i. e. arbitrary compositions of segmented symbols) or query symbols (i. e. cropped images of symbols). The whole dataset is currently composed of 5 document collections containing around 11, 100 images representing 128, 700 symbols. All these collections have been made publicly available for evaluation purpose since 2007. As a result, this dataset has been employed in a large number of papers in the literature. It constitutes till today, at the best of our knowledge, one of the top datasets in the graphics recognition community for performance evaluation. In this paper, we present an overview {{about the use of}} this dataset on the specific task of symbol spotting. We report and compare the main results and characterization approaches presented in the literature. We also present some improvements of our approach resulting in some new published collections.

40|$|Begomoviruses as 			well as potyviruses infect {{cucurbits}} {{in different}} parts of the world 			but are shown to be independent pathogens able to cause severe 			disease on their own. A devastating disease suspected to be of viral 			origin was found in traditional muskmelon growing-areas of Punjab in 			the districts of Sahiwal, Pakpatten and Vehari during 2003. 			Characteristic symptoms of the disease in Punjab province were 			mosaic and chlorotic <b>spots,</b> leaf <b>distortion</b> and deformation, vein 			thickening, enations on the upper side of the leaves, leaf yellowing 			and stunting of affected plants. Initial screening of diseased 			samples revealed the presence of a bipartite begomovirus and the 			potyvirus Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). For comparison with 			Punjab, surveys were also conducted in Mardan district of North 			Western Frontier Province (NWFP) where plants showed leaf curling, 			mosaic and enations on the upper side of the leaf. Results showed 			that the disease found on muskmelon in Mardan district was caused by 			multiple infections of two viruses, ZYMV and Cucumber mosaic virus 			(CMV, family: Cucumoviridae). Dual infection of a potyvirus and a 			bipartite begomovirus associated with a severe yellow leaf curl 			disease of muskmelon in Punjab was a novel phenomenon and was 			investigated in detail. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence 			of the DNA A and DNA B of the begomovirus showed it to be a new 			species that is closely related to Tomato leaf curl new Delhi virus 			(ToLCNDV), another bipartite begomovirus widely distributed across 			the Indian subcontinent.

40|$|As {{with all}} optical systems the {{calibration}} of wide-field ultraviolet (UV) systems includes three main areas: sensitivity, imaging quality, and imaging capability. The {{one thing that}} makes UV calibrations difficult {{is the need for}} working in vacuum substantially extending the required time and effort compared to visible systems. In theory a ray tracing and characterization of each individual component of the optical system (mirrors, windows, and grating) should provide the transmission efficiency of the combined system. However, potentially unknown effects (contamination, misalignment, and measurement errors) can make the final error too large and unacceptable for most applications. Therefore, it is desirable to test and measure the optical properties of the whole system in vacuum and compare the overall response to the response of a calibrated photon detector. A proper comparison then allows the quantification of individual sources of uncertainty and ensures that the whole instrument performance is within acceptable tolerances or pinpoints which parts fail to meet requirements. Based on the experience with the IMAGE Spectrographic Imager, the Wide-band Imaging Camera, and the ICON Far Ultraviolet instruments, we discuss the steps and procedures for the proper radiometric sensitivity and passband calibration, <b>spot</b> size, imaging <b>distortions,</b> flatfield, and field of view determination.

50|$|The {{majority}} of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, {{as the best way}} to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger. The Slender Man's behavior changes slightly between levels. In the first level, the Slender Man can be seen outside the window, and after going through the gate outside he can be seen on the top of hills well away from the player. In level two, he most often teleports off-screen or just out of the character's line of sight, but is capable of appearing {{directly in front of the}} player. It is observed that his motion centers around following the player, but consists largely of jumping from place to place, the inconvenience of which is increased as each of the eight pages are collected. His behavior is much the same as this in level four, except more active. In level three, he pursues much less aggressively, though is capable of teleporting directly in front of the player and ending the game. In this level, the main antagonist is a girl who chases the player (most often following her path directly, but has been seen teleporting. It is unknown whether this is a glitch or an in-game mechanic). The only way of subduing her is by focusing the flashlight (on its second setting) on her. While looking at the Slender Man, the camera succumbs to electronic distortions such as static, blurring, color <b>spots,</b> audio <b>distortion,</b> etc., which obstructs the player's vision unless facing away, and far enough from it. The player cannot pause while this occurs, to prevent them taking a break due to being frightened. When caught, the death or game over screen is also different; while in Slender: The Eight Pages, the player saw a white static background with Slender Man's faceless head, the one for Slender: The Arrival is black, with an overhead-lit and color-distorted hue and less static.There are also new choices in difficulty (which must first be unlocked by completing the game once) being easy, normal, and hardcore. The differences being that hardcore allows the flashlight to run out, enemies are more aggressive and the player's stamina runs out quickly. Easy has infinite flashlight, a great deal of stamina, and the enemies are not very aggressive.|$|R
40|$|During the FATMOSE trial, {{held over}} the False Bay (South Africa) from November 2009 until October 2010, {{day and night}} (24 / 7) high {{resolution}} images were collected of point sources at a range of 15. 7 km. Simultaneously, data were collected on atmospheric parameters, as relevant for the turbulence conditions: air- and sea temperature, windspeed, relative humidity and the structure parameter for refractive index: Cn 2. The data provide statistical information on the mean value and the variance of the atmospheric point spread function and the associated modulation transfer function during series of consecutive frames. This information allows the prediction of the range performance for a given sensor, target and atmospheric condition, which is of great importance for the user of optical sensors in related operational areas and for the developers of image processing algorithms. In addition the occurrence of “lucky shots” in series of frames is investigated: occasional frames with locally small blur spots. The simultaneously measured short exposure blur and the beam wander are compared with simultaneously collected scintillation data along the same path and the Cn 2 data from a locally installed scintillometer. By using two vertically separated sources, the correlation is determined between the beam wander in their images, providing information on the spatial extension of the atmospheric turbulence (eddy size).
