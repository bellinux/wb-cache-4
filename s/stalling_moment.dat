Having decided against recording the album in the band's rehearsal space in Jobson's basement, it was recorded with Elbow frontman Guy Garvey {{in a church}} on the Isle of Mull. Despite being heralded by the NME as figureheads of the so-called New Acoustic Movement (although Bramwell didn't want to admit to there being an acoustic scene at the time [...] "because of the labels that immediately get attached to ‘acoustic music’"), the band returned home from touring to find the label had gone bust, owing the band money. The album went out of print in the UK, which Bramwell later described as a <b>stalling</b> <b>moment</b> for the band, but was still available in Europe due to it being distributed by a different label, so the band toured Holland, Germany and France {{instead of focusing on}} the UK.|$|E
40|$|It {{was found}} that large {{increases}} in stability occurred at high Mach numbers, reducing the controllability of the airplane. Large increases in diving moment were also encountered at high Mach numbers and moderate lift coefficients.

The refan nacelle was tested in conjunction with various pylons of reduced span relative to the production DC- 9 - 30 pylon. Also, a horizontal tail that was larger than the production tail was tested. The data show that the refan installation has a small detrimental effect on the DC- 9 - 30 deep stall recovery capability, that recovery characteristics are essentially independent of pylon span, and that the larger horizontal tail significantly increases recovery margins. The deep stall characteristics with the refan installation, within the range of pylon spans tested, are acceptable with no additional design changes anticipated...|$|R

50|$|Pastor Maldonado {{became the}} fifth winner {{in as many}} races in GP2 in 2010 {{following}} a dominant victory in Turkey. Rapax driver Maldonado got past polesitter Davide Valsecchi (iSport) at the start and never looked troubled, lapping up to a second quicker than his rivals before slowing down {{in the final stages}} of the race and settling for a huge victory margin of 17.9 seconds. There was rather more competition for the remaining podium places. Valsecchi spent the first stint trying to hold off Sergio Pérez, only for the Mexican to leapfrog him in the pits. But Pérez's pace began to fade dramatically as the race progressed and Valsecchi capitalised with a nice move at the end of lap 26 to reclaim second. That was Valsecchi's afternoon sorted, but Pérez now had ART's Sam Bird to worry about, and after a prolonged battled the Briton came out on top to steal the final podium spot, leaving Pérez to just barely hold off Addax team-mate Giedo van der Garde for fourth. By comparison, Maldonado's Rapax team-mate Luiz Razia had a relatively serene drive to sixth, but there was more action just behind him. DPR's Giacomo Ricci and Racing Engineering's Christian Vietoris were disputing the final point for eighth when they made contact and sailed off the track, allowing Ricci's stablemate Michael Herck past. Vietoris continued, but Ricci was forced to retire. Not content with provisional pole for Sunday, Herck then dispensed with Racing Engineering's Dani Clos for seventh, and Clos later dropped behind Vietoris to inadvertently give the German pole position for the sprint race. iSport's third-place qualifier Oliver Turvey had a terrible afternoon, losing two spots off the start and then being dealt a drivethrough penalty for moving twice to defend his position. It was while honouring that penalty that he was then picked up for speeding in pitlane, resulting in another drive-through and an eventual finishing position of 15th. Scuderia Coloni lost both cars late in the race when Vladimir Arabadzhiev crashed into the tyrewall with two laps remaining and Alberto Valerio spun and <b>stalled</b> <b>moments</b> later, while Super Nova's Marcus Ericsson was forced to park at mid-distance when his engine exploded. The other major incident occurred much earlier, when Spain feature race winner Charles Pic and ART's Jules Bianchi found themselves on the same patch of Turn 3 at the same time; the resultant collision putting both out of the race.|$|R

In order to show how greatly the wing section affects the minimum speed, curves are plotted against various loadings. The disposition of wings on the airplane slightly affects the lift coefficient, and a few such cases are discussed. Another factor that has an effect on minimum speed is the extra lift exerted by the slip stream on the wings. Also discussed are procedures to be followed by the pilot, especially with regard to stick movements during low speed flight.

With the {{expansion}} and improvement of video streaming services, cloud-based video is evolving into a necessary feature of any successful business for reaching {{internal and external}} audiences. This paper considers video streaming over distributed systems where the video segments are encoded using an erasure code for better reliability thus being the first work to our best knowledge that considers video streaming over erasure-coded distributed cloud systems. The download time of each coded chunk of each video segment is characterized and ordered statistics over {{the choice of the}} erasure-coded chunks is used to obtain the playback time of different video segments. Using the playback times, bounds on the moment generating function on the stall duration is used to bound the mean <b>stall</b> duration. <b>Moment</b> generating function based bounds on the ordered statistics are also used to bound the stall duration tail probability which determines the probability that the stall time is greater than a pre-defined number. These two metrics, mean stall duration and the stall duration tail probability, are important quality of experience (QoE) measures for the end users. Based on these metrics, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly minimize the convex combination of both the QoE metrics averaged over all requests over the placement and access of the video content. The non-convex problem is solved using an efficient iterative algorithm. Numerical results show significant improvement in QoE metrics for cloud-based video as compared to the considered baselines.

40|$|Global {{coefficients}} for {{unsteady aerodynamic forces}} are {{a powerful tool for}} the assessment of the aeroelastic response of bridges in turbulent winds. However, global coefficients do not provide any information about the phenomenology of the fluid–structure interaction. This paper introduces a distributed representation of global coefficients that, exploiting the knowledge of the unsteady pressure field along the contour of the deck, allows to understand more in detail the aerodynamics of the phenomenon. We use the distributed representation to analyze the unsteady forces acting on a simple closed-box single girder deck, and we focus the study on two aspects. First, we analyze the unsteady aerodynamic forces near the <b>stall</b> of the <b>moment</b> coefficient, highlighting that a specific area of the deck governs the phenomenon; then we focus the attention on the comparison between the phenomenology of self-excited and wind induced unsteady forces.

40|$|Control {{of dynamic}} stall of {{airfoils}} {{is of interest}} for its potential to enhance the performance of rotorcraft. The experiments described herein used pulsed vortex generator jets, shown previously to prevent separation on steady wings and airfoils, to delay dynamic stall on a rapidly pitching airfoil. In tests on a NACA- 0012 at low Reynolds numbers, the jets yielded a 25 % increase in the lift coefficient achievable without <b>moment</b> <b>stall.</b> Next, a differential equation model of the dynamic stall process was derived and experimentally validated. Models of this form enable the application of well-known techniques in control design to flow control. In {{the final round of}} experiments, a Luenberger observer based on the mathematical model detected incipient dynamic stall. A controller used the stall prediction to operate the pulsed jets only when needed to prevent stall. The controller turned the jets off {{for the remainder of the}} oscillation cycle.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the flow over a rotor blade is {{strongly}} influenced by locally three-dimensional and unsteady effects, practical experience has always demonstrated that substantial improvements in the aerodynamic performance can be gained by improving the steady two-dimensional charateristics of the airfoil(s) employed. The two phenomena known to have great impact on the overall rotor performance are: (1) retreating blade stall with the associated large pressure drag, and (2) compressibility effects on the advancing blade leading to shock formation and the associated wave drag and boundary-layer separation losses. It was concluded that: optimization routines are a powerful tool for finding solutions to multiple design point problems; the optimization process must be guided by the judicious choice of geometric and aerodynamic constraints; optimization routines should be appropriately coupled to viscous, not inviscid, transonic flow solvers; hybrid design procedures in conjunction with optimization routines represent the most efficient approach for rotor airfroil design; unsteady effects resulting in the delay of lift and <b>moment</b> <b>stall</b> should be modeled using simple empirical relations; and inflight optimization of aerodynamic loads (e. g., use of variable rate blowing, flaps, etc.) can satisfy any number of requirements at design and off-design conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{detailed}} behaviour of the unsteady {{boundary layer}} and stall events occurred on a sinusoidally oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil at Re = 1. 35 x 105 was investigated experimentally by using closely-spaced multiple hot-film sensor arrays. The hot-film measurements were supplemented by surface pressure measurements, hot-wire wake velocity surveys and smoke-flow visualizations. Three typical oscillation parameters: attached flow, light stall, and deep stall were tested. Special attention {{was focused on}} the non-intrusive identification of the spatial-temporal progression of the locations of the boundary-layer transition and separation and reattachment points for a range of oscillation frequencies and amplitudes both prior to, during, and post the stall. The results show that for an unsteady airfoil, the reduced frequency of the oscillation was found to be highly significant and only small values of reduced frequency were required to delay the onset of the various boundary-layer events, and to produce significant variations and hysteresis in the peak values of lift and drag forces and the pitching moments, which are fundamentally different from their static counterparts. Lift stall was observed to occur when the leading-edge vortex reached 90 % of the chord, while <b>moment</b> <b>stall</b> occurred {{at the end of the}} upward spread of the trailing-edge flow reversal. The convection speed of the leading-edge and the secondary vortices were also reported. Dynamic stall was found to be caused by an abrupt turbulent separation near the leading-edge region and not with the bursting of the laminar separation bubble, as is commonly observed for a static NACA 0012 airfoil; the result being the initiation, growth and convection of an energetic leading-edge vortex.

40|$|A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) {{methodology}} {{is extended}} {{to analyze the}} effectiveness of a leading edge slat (LE-Slat) for mitigating the adverse effects of dynamic stall on rotor blade aerodynamic and dynamic response. This involved the following improvements over the existing CFD methodology to handle a multi-element airfoil rotor: incorporating the so-called Implicit Hole Cutting method for inter-mesh connectivity, implementing a generalized force transfer routine for transferring LE-Slat loads onto the main blade, and achieving increased parallelization of the code. Initially, the structured overset mesh CFD solver is extensively validated against available 2 -D experimental wind tunnel test cases in steady and unsteady flight conditions. The solver predicts the measurements with sufficient accuracy for test cases with both the baseline airfoil and that with two slat configurations, S- 1 and S- 6. As expected, the addition of the slat is found to be highly effective in delaying stall until larger angles for the case of a static airfoil and ameliorating the effects of dynamic stall for a 2 -D pitching airfoil. The 3 -D coupled CFD/CSD model is extensively validated against flight test data of a UH- 60 A rotor in a high-altitude, high-thrust flight condition, namely C 9017, characterized by distinct dynamic stall events in the retreating side of the rotor disk. The validated rotor analysis tool is then used to successfully demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} LE-Slat in mitigating (or eliminating) dynamic stall on the rotor retreating side. The calculations are performed with a modified UH- 60 A blade with a 40 %-span slatted airfoil section. The addition of the slat is effective in the mitigation (and/or elimination) of lift and <b>moment</b> <b>stall</b> at outboard stations, which in turn is accompanied by a reduction of torsional structural loads (upto 73 %) and pitch link loads (upto 62 %) as compared to the baseline C 9017 values. The effect of a dynamically moving slat, actuating between slat positions S- 1 and S- 6, is thoroughly investigated, firstly on 2 -D airfoil dynamic stall, and then on the UH- 60 A rotor. Three slat actuation strategies with upto [1, 3, 5]/rev harmonics, respectively, are considered. However, it is noted that the dynamic slat does not necessarily result in better rotor performance as compared to a static slat configuration. The coupled CFD/CSD platform is further used to successfully demonstrate the capability of the slat (S- 6) to achieve upto 10 % higher thrust than C 9017, which is beyond the conventional thrust limit imposed by McHugh's stall boundary. Stall mitigation due to the slat results in a reduction of torsional load upto 54 % and reduction of pitch link load upto 32 % as compared to the baseline C 9017 flight test values, even for an increase in thrust of 10 %...|$|R
