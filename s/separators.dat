5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water <b>separators</b> designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E

The transport behavior of liquid water inside the porous <b>separator</b> was also investigated using another cell for the direct observation of the porous cross-section. Because of the higher contact resistance, the cell voltage with porous <b>separator</b> is lower than that with serpentine <b>separator,</b> but a stable operation can be maintained with the porous <b>separator</b> under conditions at higher current density and lower stoichiometric ratio of cathode gas.

The downer, designed for pyrolytic co-processing of heavy oil and biomass to valuable liquid fuels and chemicals, capitalizes on the plug flow behavior of gravity-assisted downward gas-solids flow, {{which has been}} proven in previous work. However, {{the effect of the}} reactor exit on unit performance has not been studied. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the gas-solids <b>separator</b> performance in a 0. 07 m diameter, 1. 34 m tall cold model downer was done in this thesis. A novel, fast and cost effective pressure-response-based gas RTD measurement technique was developed that was able to screen potential <b>separator</b> designs. Several other conventional experimental methods, including solids RTD measurement using phosphorescent tracer and stripping efficiency measurement using CO 2 tracer, were used to further assess the <b>separator</b> performance. The <b>separator</b> performance was found to be strongly dependent on the <b>separator</b> cone diameter. A novel, objective <b>Separator</b> Performance Index (SPI) was developed to assess <b>separator</b> performance in a comprehensive manner. <b>Separator</b> performance was shown to increase dramatically with the <b>separator</b> cone size.

The lube oil <b>separator</b> functions to purify the lube oil to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil <b>separator</b> will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube oil <b>separator</b> used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the <b>separator</b> is introduced.
