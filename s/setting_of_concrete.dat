Each program statement is given an inter-pretation over abstract values that is conservative with respect to its interpretation over corresponding <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> stores; that is, the result of &quot;executing &quot; a statement mustbe an abstract value that describes a superset <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> stores that actually arise.

Aalto's design went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal designed in the Nordic Classicism style (owing much to Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund, especially his Stockholm City Library) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style. Such architectural solutions as a sunken reading-well, free-flowing ceilings and cylindrical skylights, first tested in Viipuri, would regularly appear in Aalto's works. Aalto differed from {{the first generation of}} modernist architects (such as Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier) in his predilection for natural materials: in this design, [...] "wood was first introduced into an otherwise modernist <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> white stucco, glass, and steel".|$|E

30|$|A {{description}} {{of the use of}} SAP for internal water curing {{can be found in the}} literature (Kohler et al. 2007; Jensen and Hansen 2001; Jensen and Hansen 2002; Friedemann et al. 2006; Assmann 2013; Mechtcherine and Reinhardt 2012). The absorption and desorption in water and pore solutions appears to be well understood; however more data is needed regarding different types of SAP. According to Monning (2009), the water close to the surface of the polymers is lost rapidly. However, water closer to the core of the polymers must overcome more its side-chains, which interact with the water molecules through van-der-Waals forces. SAP starts releasing water after a setting time and appears to be completed after 1.5 – 2  days, depending on the cement paste and on the curing temperature, but there is still little knowledge to explain the mechanisms of internal curing of concrete using SAP, especially in the first few hours after the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> (Mechtcherine and Reinhardt 2012).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Smectite accelerates the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> The {{mechanism}} of accelerated setting is primarily attributed to ion exchange between calcium ions in smectite and potassium ions in the mortar-pore solution. The reaction of gypsum {{is controlled by}} calcium ions from smectite. C 3 A and C 3 S rapidly react, then setting occurs. Pop-out and exfoliation of concrete are caused by laumontite, depending {{on the content of}} laumontite in the aggregate. Volume change due to laumontite-leonhardite conversion is one of the mechanisms of the deterioration. Pyrite produces cracks in concrete. The results of wetting and drying tests and exposure tests indicate that the durability of concrete is low when aggregate contains more than 6 wt % of pyrite. Biotite reduces the workabil-ity, strength and freeze-thaw resistance of concrete, all of which are related with the content and grain size of biotite. The low flow and strength is caused by sheet-like form of biotite...|$|E
30|$|The <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> is {{determined}} by using the mortar contained in it. A penetrometer is used for determining the initial and final setting times of mortar. Appropriate size needles (cross areas are 645, 323, 161, 65, 32, and 12.5 or 645 – 12.5  mm 2) by hardening stage of mortar were used. The force required to penetrate one inch in depth is noted. The force divided by {{the area of the}} bearing surface of the needle yields the penetration resistance (Ramachandran et al. 2002). The setting time of cement paste was assessed based on penetration resistance in accordance with ASTM C 403 (2008). ASTM C 403 defines the initial time as when the pressure becomes 500  psi (3.5  MPa) and the final time as when the pressure becomes 4000  psi (28  MPa). Tests were conducted in the thermo-hydrostat room at 20 [*]±[*] 3  °C and 60 [*]±[*] 5 % humidity, and measurements were taken at 1 -h intervals starting from 3.5  h from when the cement came in contact with water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The use {{of super}} {{absorbent}} polymer (SAP) in concrete {{is proven to}} have many positive effects on the properties of concrete in its both stages; fresh concrete and hardened concrete. This study focuses {{on the use of}} an optimum amount of Sodium Polyacrylate as a super absorbent polymer in ordinary plain concrete. One of the major improvements that the SAP can contribute to the concrete is by providing internal water source. This internal water source acts as internal curing agent after the final <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> At the same time the SAP releases water at relatively slower rate at the fresh concrete stage. The SAP also provides additional voids in the concrete mass. These voids affect the concrete strength negatively at the same time improve the concrete performance by improving the concrete workability and placeability, reducing the concrete susceptibility to freezing thawing cycles, and improving concrete stability. The main focus of this study will be on the effect of the SAP on the fresh concrete as well as the hardened concrete.

40|$|With {{knowledge}} of the time to initial set, contractors will be able plan measures to finish, texture, and saw cut concrete pavements on time. The point at which final set occurs is of importance, since it provides an estimate of when the concrete strength and stiffness development will start. In this study, experimental work was performed under laboratory and field conditions {{to determine the effect}} of temperature, different cements, and supplementary cementing materials on the initial and final setting times of concrete mixtures. The objectives of this paper are to present and calibrate a setting model that correlates the degree of hydration to the setting times collected under laboratory and field conditions. Initial and final set times of the concrete were determined with penetration resistance testing. Field data were collected from seven concrete pavement projects paved throughout the year, in different climatic regions. The results indicate that final setting occurs at approximately the same degree of hydration for a particular mixture irrespective of the curing history. This observation is also true for the initial set condition. Models are developed to predict the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> with the degree of hydration and the water-cementitious materials ratio as variables. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using the small-dimension break-off test for evaluation of the bond quality at the interface between steel bar and concrete. Experimental studies were performed on bar-type concrete specimens and reinforced concrete beams. Twelve bar-type concrete specimens containing plain and deformed steel bars with different diameters were used to develop {{the relationship between the}} break-off moment and the adhesive strength at the steel bar/concrete interface. Subsequently, three reinforced concrete beams containing normal reinforcing bars, epoxy-coated reinforcing bars, and bars smeared with oil to simulate various adhesive conditions at the bar/concrete interface were used to study how the break-off moment and the bond strength were affected by the different adhesive conditions. In addition, two beam specimens containing normal reinforcing bars were vibrated severely on a self-made shaking table shortly after initial <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> to simulate the bond damage in fresh reinforced concrete beams due to unexpected vibration or impact. Experimental results show that the effective break-off moment has a good correlation with the adhesive strength at the interface between steel bar and concrete.
