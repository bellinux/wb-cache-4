[...] Following Mrs. Eakins's 1938 death, her executors emptied the house at 1729 Mount Vernon Street, removing the items that they deemed salable at auction. Bregler described the aftermath as the [...] "most tragic and pitiful sight I ever saw.

I never want to <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> again." [...] He rescued a trove of her husband's minor works, and disobeyed her instructions to burn certain items. Mrs. Eakins had painted a posthumous portrait of her husband in the 1920s (probably from a photograph).

Pictures of hospitals during the Crimean War showed terrible conditions, but even those could not compare with the dreadful sights I met on this visit. Shells of men lay on the floor sunken-eyed and helpless; some were swollen with hunger, oedema and ber-beri, others in the last stages of dysentery, lay unconscious and dying. They had no pillows or clothes, few cups, fewer bowls, or even medical supplies. [...] There were three hundred desperately sick men, many unable to help themselves, or to carry food to their mouths.

S. is a kind of movable arts feast. For 16 years they have been coming to-gether in different configurations in cities and towns from coast to coast and border to border, producing a different festival in each location. In theatre circles, the AFP is legendary for its lofty and far-reaching mis-sion. Far from a traveling road show, the AFP thinks of itself as a cultural or-ganizing tool, working with each of these communities to create an arts project that will leave lasting social change in its wake. The AFP is worth watching, if only because of the merits of each of its member companies, all of whom bear bona fide community-arts credentials and are vital arts power-houses in their home communities. The combination of these talents can add up to some awesome potential. Wherever the AFP works, it draws many artists into its net, but the “core...|$|R
