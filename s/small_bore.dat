25|$|With {{the rise}} of {{recorded}} music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began {{to have a more}} consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 {{gallons of}} water and had a bunker capable of {{carrying}} nine cubic feet of coke. It was a vertical engine with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> and acted upon a crankshaft through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by cog-wheel gears. Exhaust steam was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney.|$|E
25|$|The dulcian is {{generally}} {{made from a}} single piece of maple, with the bores being drilled and reamed first, and then the outside planed to shape. The reed is attached {{to the end of a}} metal bocal, inserted into the top of the <b>small</b> <b>bore.</b> Unlike the bassoon it normally has a flared bell, sometimes made from a separate piece of timber. This bell can sometimes be muted, the mute being either detachable, or built into the instrument. The outside of the instrument can also be covered in leather, like the cornett.|$|E

25|$|Second Karachi Water Supply (1993-2001). Under {{the second}} Karachi Water Supply Project, the World Bank contributed with US$92 million to {{increase}} water supply coverage and sanitation in Karachi {{and to improve}} operation, management and financial viability of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB). The project started in 1993 and provided {{for the construction of}} a canal to bring water from the Indus River, pumping stations, water and wastewater treatment facilities. In low income areas, <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> sewers were to be built. The operational efficiency of KWSB was expected to improve through technical assistance by the World Bank and increased cost reduction measures, e.g. reduction of water losses.|$|E
25|$|Connection to the River Witham at Brayford was {{hampered}} by the <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but John Rennie's plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargos of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool from a rubbish-filled eyesore into an attractive marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E

500|$|Ericsson's Monitor, {{which was}} built at Ericsson's yard on the East River in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, {{incorporated}} new and striking design features, the most significant of which were her armor and armament. Instead of {{the large numbers of}} guns of rather <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> that had characterized warships in the past, Ericsson opted for only two guns of large caliber; he wanted to use [...] guns, but had to settle for [...] Dahlgren guns when the larger size were unavailable. These were mounted in a cylindrical turret, [...] in diameter, [...] high, covered with iron [...] thick. The whole rotated on a central spindle, and was moved by a steam engine that could be controlled by one man. [...] Ericsson was afraid that using the full 30 pounds of black powder to fire the huge cannon would raise the risk of an explosion in the turret. [...] He demanded that a charge of 15 pounds be used to lessen this possibility. [...] As with Virginia, trials found that a full charge would pierce armor plate, a finding that would have affected the outcome of the battle. A serious flaw in the design was the pilot house from which the ship would be , a small structure forward of the turret on the main deck. Its presence meant that the guns could not fire directly forward, and it was isolated from other activities on the ship. Despite the late start and the novelty of construction, Monitor was actually completed a few days before her counterpart Virginia, but the Confederates activated Virginia first.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Army issues their marksmanship {{qualification}} badges for {{a variety}} of weapons while the U.S. Marine Corps only issues theirs for the service rifle and service pistol.

[...] The NRA issues marksmanship qualification badges for air rifles, rifles, pistols, and shotguns; however the NRA focuses on different rifles and pistols than the CMP. [...] For marksmanship competition badges, the U.S. military award rifle and pistol competition badges; however, the U.S. National Guard also award marksmanship competition badges for machine gun and sniper rifle. [...] The CMP awards marksmanship competition badges for air rifle, rifle, pistol, and [...]22 rimfire pistol while the NRA awards them for air rifle, <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> rifle, revolver, and semi-automatic pistol.|$|E
2500|$|The head {{used during}} this time was the {{so-called}} [...] "rectangle port", named after its exhaust port shape.

50|$|Historically, the piccolo had no keys, {{and should}} not be {{confused}} with the fife, which has a <b>smaller</b> <b>bore</b> and is therefore more strident. The piccolo is used in conjunction with marching drums in traditional formations at the Carnival of Basel, Switzerland.|$|R
2500|$|Like the trumpet, the {{trombone}} {{is considered}} a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter.

The bore expands through the backbore to the bell, which is typically between [...] A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.|$|E
2500|$|Compressor diving [...] An {{even more}} basic {{system is the}} [...] "Compressor diving" [...] {{arrangement}} used in the Philippines and Caribbean for fishing. This rudimentary and highly hazardous system uses {{a large number of}} <b>small</b> <b>bore</b> plastic tubes connected to a single compressor to supply a large number of divers simultaneously. The delivery end of the hose is unencumbered by any mechanism or mouthpiece, and is simply held by the divers' teeth. Air supply is free flow and often unfiltered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} is the side entry holder, where the {{specimen}} is placed near {{the tip of}} a long metal (brass or stainless steel) rod, with the specimen placed flat in a <b>small</b> <b>bore.</b> Along the rod are several polymer vacuum rings to allow for the formation of a vacuum seal of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the side entry holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the vacuum rings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} design range were the 4 and 5 types with <b>smaller</b> <b>bore</b> sizes and the 29 type with larger bore sizes. These were {{replaced}} with the 74, 75 and 89 and then, later, by the 274, 275 and 289 types.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 {{the engine}} was modified: the {{displacement}} increased to 4940cc with a bigger stroke and a <b>smaller</b> <b>bore,</b> with fuel injection added. The new engine developed 340 bhp. The fuel injected 5000 GT was shown at the 1960 Salone di Torino.|$|R
50|$|Providing {{a better}} gas seal around the {{projectile}} as polygonal bores {{tend to have}} a slightly <b>smaller</b> <b>bore</b> area, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities and slightly increased accuracy.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{manufacturing}} focused on standard grades of black powder from Fg used in large bore rifles and shotguns, through FFg (medium and small-bore arms such as muskets and fusils), FFFg (small-bore rifles and pistols), and FFFFg (extreme <b>small</b> <b>bore,</b> short pistols and most commonly for priming flintlocks). [...] A coarser grade {{for use in}} military artillery blanks was designated A-1. These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. [...] In the United Kingdom, the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter {{of one or two}} millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters. [...] Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS sieve mesh size, being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains. Recognized grain sizes are Gunpowder G 7, G 20, G 40, and G 90.|$|E
2500|$|An Act of Parliament was {{obtained}} in 1803 {{which gave the}} proprietors the power to raise £50,000 in £50 shares {{for the construction of}} the canal. The land was donated by the Duke, who took 125 of the 1000 shares. Taylor, who also managed Wheal Friendship mine, acted as engineer, and work started in August 1803. The largest engineering feature of the canal was a tunnel under Morwell Down. When cutting of it began, copper ore was discovered close to the Tavistock end, and this became the Wheal Crebor mine, which was managed as a separate project. It had its own entrance, by the tunnel entrance, and used water-powered machinery, driven by water flowing along the canal. The canal from Tavistock to the tunnel mouth, including an aqueduct which carried it over the River Lumburn, was opened in 1805. The [...] tunnel was cut through rock, was of <b>small</b> <b>bore,</b> and required Taylor to construct two types of pump, one to keep the workings drained, and the other to clean the air. Both were powered by water wheels, driven by the canal water. The tunnel, which was driven through elvan rock and killas clay-slate, is [...] below Morwell Down at its deepest point, and it was finished in 1816.|$|E
