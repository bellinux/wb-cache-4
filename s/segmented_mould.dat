40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{demoulding}} of the tire from <b>segmented</b> <b>mould.</b> The optimal number of segments {{will depend on}} a concrete tire tread. In case of small number of segments, the negative angles generate high stress on the material which can cause a damage of the final product, mainly due to lower strength when the rubber is hot. With negative angles rise also the difficulty to shift the segments into radial direction and increase wear of the moving plates due to the friction resistance. On the other hand {{a large number of}} segments provides construction and economic problems. That is why, it is necessary to perform calculation of stress acting on the tire tread surface during mould opening and optimize the number of segments {{in such a way that}} the solution will be economical. The obtained results showed that in this case study, without consideration the wear resistance, all the proposed solutions may be used. If we do not consider the economical part, the optimal segment angle is 23 Â° and the number of segments is 11...|$|E

By using DEFORM- 3 D to {{simulate}} the turning process of the tire active mold segment, the stress distribution, temperature distribution, strain distribution and cutting force transformation of turning tool and work-piece can be explored. The simulation results are helpful to configure the material {{and shape of the}} turning tools. Also the results {{play an important role in}} reducing development cost of the segment manufacturing technology and improving the accuracy and the lifetime of the <b>mould</b> <b>segment...</b>|$|R

The main reason being that South Africa {{does not have}} enough very large size CNC machines on which these could be machined. A large size mould half can be split into two or more smaller parts for machining purposes and then reassembled later. In this way many large size moulds, especially rotational moulds can be manufactured on medium size CNC machines. Since the large component has been split into small parts, these can be distributed to different subcontractors to machine simultaneously, and thereby reducing the total manufacturing lead-time. The project then uses three case studies to advance the proposed concept for mould manufacture. A small size rotational mould for a model drum is manufactured to confirm that Pentech had both the infrastructure and required skill to make a rotational mould of any sort. Then a medium size rotational mould of a steering wheel is manufactured. This case study is the key and longest stage in this project; it consists of the full process of mould subdivision followed by full mould manufacture, some subcontracting of parts and lastly full product testing. Finally, a part of a large size mould was manufactured for purpose of investigating all aspects around the subcontracting ofmould parts. In the first case study the clamping strategy used through out {{as an integral part of}} the subdivision strategy is proven. The second case study using the medium size rotational mould successfully demonstrates the subdivision concept, along with its material savings. This second case study also introduces the idea of including CNC lathe parts. Lastly, the third case study using a large size rotational mould proves the contractibility of the <b>mould</b> <b>segments</b> using NC files, despite certain industry leaders believing that machine shops would not be interested in accepting work on the basis ofNC file...|$|R
40|$|Bra cup {{moulding}} {{is currently}} a remarkable process {{in the production of}} seamless intimate apparel. The process is highly complex, time-consuming and error-prone due to the large variations of foam and lamination properties, cup styles and sizes, and geometric features of graduated padding. In particular, the three-dimensional (3 D) geometric shape of foam cups is difficult to assess accurately because they are very soft and readily deform. In cases that involve fitting problems, shape modifications of the mould head and determination of the optimal moulding conditions have undergone repeated trials and errors. There is limited knowledge about the effects of foam properties and cup parameters in the controlling of moulding conditions. This study adopts a parameterization-based remesh algorithm method to evaluate the 3 D shapes of the convex surface of scanned cup samples. The shape conformity of the cup is quantified in accordance to the corresponding mould head. In this respect, the moulding conditions that would achieve the most desirable geometric shapes of bra cups can be accurately and objectively demonstrated. Based on moulding experiments with 6 types of polyurethane (PU) foam materials, empirical equations that associate the cup shape conformity and the shape deviations from selected cup sectional curves are established. Through the use of non-linear regression models, the shape conformity of the moulded cups can be predicted by moulding conditions with reasonable accuracy. The shape conformity provides effective guidelines for quality assurance and improves production efficiency of bra cup moulding. Moreover, thermal-mechanical properties, such as compressive strain and softening temperature obtained from thermomechanical analysis (TMA) scans, provide a good understanding of cup shape conformity and determine the lowest moulding temperature at initial trails of the bra cup moulding process. Surprisingly, in pliable foams, the cup size does not have an apparent effect on the moulding conditions to achieve optimal cup shape conformity. The results reveal that the moulding conditions for sizes 34 B and 34 D could remain the same for pliable foam materials. Nevertheless, in the case of more rigid foams, a higher moulding temperature is required to achieve a desirable cup shape for size 34 D as more energy is required for the heat-setting of foam materials with higher proportions of hard <b>segments</b> at the <b>moulding</b> of a larger cup size in anticipation of larger deformations.
