500|$|Humber debuted {{with the}} White Sox in their third game in relief. He made two pitches, {{both of which}} {{resulted}} in hits and base runners that came around to score. With Jake Peavy injured {{at the start of}} the 2011 season, the White Sox gave Humber the opportunity to pitch in their starting rotation. On April 9, 2011, Humber won his first start with the White Sox, pitching [...] innings and only allowing one run. Humber surprised the White Sox with his strong performance. On April 25, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, but with one out Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle. He finished with seven scoreless innings. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In early July, when he led the major leagues with [...] innings pitched and held an 8–4 record with a 2.69 ERA, he seemed like a probable selection for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In mid-July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: [...] "I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'" [...] Humber said. [...] "As soon as I went in , I asked one of the guys to call her to make sure <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was OK.", adding [...] "My main concern was cheering up my wife." [...] He appeared in one rehabilitation start for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League. Humber pitched seven scoreless innings in his major league return. Humber completed his first full season as an MLB starting pitcher with a 9–9 win–loss record with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings.|$|E
2500|$|Bond's {{reporting}} style {{suggested that}} she was very close personally to members of the Royal Family. She commented that she had become close to Diana and that her death came as a great shock. She actually instigated her first meeting with Diana. She sent a note, suggesting that if she was to report on Diana properly then she should at least know what her character was actually like, not basing her thoughts on stories that had appeared in newspapers. She commented on that meeting at Kensington Palace, stating: [...] "Princess Diana was charming, articulate, fresh, interesting, but manipulative. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was a journalist. This was no girlie-girlie meeting." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How did <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> hadn't {{said a word}} at {{the phone}} except 'Yes--yes--yes.' She says <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> how <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> but <b>she</b> did <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> was awake and she heard the ring and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that there was word from Jem.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She thinks me {{old enough}} {{to take care of}} myself, {{whatever}} you do, Mr. Hailes; besides, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can come up to breathe! I long for it!' ...|$|R
60|$|Brightened up when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was near! That was glorious! That brightened up creation.|$|E
60|$|I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her {{tenderness}} towards my wife; and I {{was sure}} that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, the boys." [...] It was Mr Crimble's little dilemma {{all over}} again: Lady Pollacke was evidently {{wondering}} whether I knew <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> knew.|$|E
6000|$|... "A folly--at such a time," [...] Sautron insisted. The Marquis {{looked a}} question. The Count {{answered}} it. [...] "Aline," [...] said he, pregnantly. [...] "She <b>knows.</b> How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can't tell you, but <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> and <b>she</b> is deeply offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it don't. She told Dade Walker that I got all {{the biggest}} flat-irons, when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> offered her the bureau. I did {{everything}} I could {{to make her feel}} satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor child, {{how will}} she bear it when <b>she</b> <b>knows?</b> <b>I</b> shall {{never see her}} again in life. It is hard, so hard. She does not suspect? You guard her from that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{our eyes}} met, and I fancied {{that this time}} she was looking a little frightened. At any rate <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> was sure of that.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was coming}} over to Hope {{just as soon as}} the roads made it safe and {{pleasant}} for automobiling," [...] he murmured to himself.|$|E
6000|$|She listen'd with a flitting blush, [...] With downcast {{eyes and}} modest grace: [...] For well <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> could not choose [...] But gaze upon her face.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{it had all}} risen for Densher to a {{considerable}} interest. [...] "And Aunt Maud--why shouldn't <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> mean that your friend there isn't really anything. Does she suppose him of ducal value?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whit. She laughed, {{and said}} she was in jest," [...] {{answered}} Jenkin; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the she-devil's jest from her earnest too well to be taken in that way. But <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> would never betray her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The little model, who was {{stroking}} a china ash-tray {{with her}} ungloved, inky fingers, muttered, with a smile, half pathetic, half cynical: [...] "She doesn't like me! <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> don't belong here. She hates me to come. She's jealous!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{listened with}} a flitting blush, [...] 25 [...] With downcast eyes and modest grace; [...] For well <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> could not choose [...] But gaze upon her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} if I am to blame," [...] he said, [...] "my wife has been no real wife to me since <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had a {{mistress}} and was no real husband to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was not {{to leave}} this place until <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was safe within our lines. I have some friends who are {{faithful}} to me." [...] After a pause she added, [...] "She has been here already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, if I {{thought so}} I'd beg her forgiveness. But I reckon I don't. What's more, I feel better than before. I'm only a cowboy an' never was much good till I met her. Then I braced. I got to havin' hopes, studyin' books, an' {{you know how}} I've been lookin' into this ranchin' game. I stopped drinkin' an' saved my money. Wal, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> all thet. Once {{she said she was}} proud of me. But it didn't seem to count big with her. An' if it can't count big I don't want it to count at all. I reckon the madder Bo is at me the more chance I've got. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> love her--thet I'd die for her--thet I'm a changed man. An' <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> never before thought of darin' to touch her hand. An' <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> flirted with Turner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go and see my mother presently. Of course she won't be {{worrying}} about me, for <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am {{able to take care}} of myself; but at the same time it will give her some satisfaction to <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> am doing. You could find my mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said he, on {{recovering}} his composure; [...] "arter I saw Blazes-- Frank, I mean, that's my brother, sir--I {{goes right}} away home to bed. I stops with my mother, sir, an' {{she saw me}} come off here this mornin', sir. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> was comin' here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I said I met you in New York. You see I {{thought she}} might think it queer if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> only met you in San Francisco three weeks ago. Of course I said we were married." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{subscribed to}} this {{with all my}} heart, God knows. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did; for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, except when she spoke in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} man slowly, [...] "my mother had some old-world belief, {{and she said}} it was a special gift. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had it. She said a thing of that kind should never be used for money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Charley, when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am ill, <b>she</b> {{will try}} to make her way into the room. Keep her out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the last! Charley, if you let her in but once, only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here, I shall die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{a terrible}} disgrace to me," [...] said the Watch-Dog of Merryland, in a solemn voice, [...] "if you escape me. What will the Queen say when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> have watched here three hundred years without seeing anyone, and then allowed the first strangers who came along {{to pass through the}} archway?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Walwyn {{would have}} argued that he need not regret his {{incapacity}} to move, since it was no doubt already too late, but Berenger burst forth--'She will resist; she will resist to the utmost, even if she deems me dead. Tortures will not shake her when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> live. I must prepare.' And he started to his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{too much}} for her. She would plague herself with these wretched {{household}} accounts! <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> hated the sound of them. I never let her bring them to me; but little did I think that she cried over them alone!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn’t do it, Bill," [...] {{said the}} skipper decidedly. [...] "Not while <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was above ground." [...] "Well, I can try," [...] {{returned}} the mate shortly. [...] "I’ve took rather a fancy to the girl. Is it a bargain?" ...|$|E
60|$|Certainly <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> grieved for Marion, that {{ours was}} now no joyful reunion. But she showed no resentment and no jealousy. Extraordinarily, {{she did not}} compete against Marion. Never once in all our time {{together}} did she say an adverse word of Marion....|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{inclined}} to think she did," [...] Maxwell answered thoughtfully. [...] "She was also probably giving you good advice in the one way available. How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> cannot tell, but {{by the light of}} past experience I can make {{a good deal of the}} medley. As you probably surmised, her warning was not the result of divination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, there's Mammy," [...] said Marie, [...] "I think it's selfish of her {{to sleep}} so sound nights; <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> need little attentions almost every hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet she's so hard to wake. I {{absolutely}} am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> doesn't <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> {{took care}} that she shouldn't see the paper. I {{wanted to give}} her this evening's {{enjoyment}} unalloyed.|$|R
