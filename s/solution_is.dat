5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

5|$|The {{solubility}} {{is highest}} in polar solvents (such as water) or ionic liquids, but {{tends to be}} low in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat of <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.|$|E
