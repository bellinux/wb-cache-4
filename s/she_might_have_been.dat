5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her {{there was nothing to be}} done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{speculated that}} she had been in unusually high spirits and had decided to run away to start a new life, was going to meet a secret lover and went off with him, or had become injured and suffered from amnesia. Darker theories speculated that Paula was depressed and may have committed suicide, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> kidnapped or murdered.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank {{said there had}} been a lot of {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E

60|$|What more <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> said <b>is</b> unknown; for Livy {{closed her}} mouth with a big sponge, and all retired to repose after the trials of the past night.|$|R
60|$|Indeed <b>she</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{one whose}} human blood was mixed {{with some other}} alien strain--as she had called herself, a {{daughter}} of the Moon.|$|R
25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked {{to the car and}} asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said that she did not smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times a}} week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|James {{reports that}} Kent fought {{for almost two}} hours and that Rivington {{was killed by a}} shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents {{armament}} consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of 20-22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or so, she had some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Admiral and {{the chief}} Huguenot leaders," [...] she said, much in the tone <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> used, <b>were</b> it a matter of {{wringing}} the necks of a dozen capons.|$|R

500|$|... "Stay" [...] {{was written}} by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. It is superficially a love song, except the protagonist cannot {{remember}} the girl's name, suggesting <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a groupie. [...] "Absolutely Curtains", the closing instrumental on the album, ends with a recording of the Mapuga tribe, {{as seen in the}} film.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wedding of River Song" [...] concludes {{the story}} {{arc of the}} Doctor's {{apparent}} death {{which began in the}} series opener, [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and resolves more pieces of River Song's timeline. Despite this, it leaves ambiguous whether the Doctor and River are legitimately married. Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat described it as [...] "a big roller coaster ride of Doctor Who madness". One of the [...] "mad idea" [...] he included in the episode, [...] "Live Chess", came because Moffat wanted to make chess— which he called [...] "one of the most boring games in the world"— into a dangerous spectator sport. Originally, the script did not include the brief scene with a Dalek; Moffat had intended to rest the Doctor's most famous adversary for the sixth series. Amy's confrontation with Madame Kovarian, a scene which shows what <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> like had she not met the Doctor, was also added into the script later.|$|E
500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". <b>She</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years}} of her life.|$|E
6000|$|... “That Jacobin!” Doña Rita was immensely surprised, as <b>she</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> Then {{resigned}} to the incomprehensible: “Yes,” she breathed out, “what {{did you do with}} him?” ...|$|R
60|$|As Helen {{returned}} to the garden again, Ridley's words of warning came into her head, and she hesitated a moment and looked at Rachel sitting between Hirst and Hewet. But she could draw no conclusions, for Hewet was still reading Gibbon aloud, and Rachel, for all the expression <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a shell, and his words water rubbing against her ears, as water rubs a shell {{on the edge of}} a rock.|$|R
60|$|From {{the first}} she betrayed a {{conviction}} that Mr. Brumley was incidental and unnecessary and that her real interest lay with Sir Isaac. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in possession of special information upon that point.|$|R
500|$|When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and {{described}} her as [...] "living in humble, {{not to say}} somewhat squalid conditions". In a letter to her son, she admitted {{that in the last}} week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot by a stray bullet, she replied [...] "they tell me that you don't hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Such was her {{domination}} of the sport that there were persistent rumours that she was actually a man. These first surfaced immediately after her first match, when {{the members of the}} opposition Ottawa side accused her of being a man. The accusation was not unfounded in the league, where it was not uncommon for boys to be disguised as women to improve the spectacle. Some opposition teams went as far as removing Lapensée's hat during games to check how long her hair was. Her father made a public statement that the claims were false, and in February 1916, the Montreal Star investigated the claims. The reporter spoke to [...] "dozens and dozens of people from Cornwall who had known her since she was little", and concluded that [...] "from what he learned he is thoroughly convinced 'he' is a 'she'." [...] Despite this the rumours lingered, and some modern sources still speculate that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a man. In 2011, an article in the Cornwall Standard Freeholder claimed that [...] "we'll never know if Albertine was actually an Albert", suggesting the possibility that Lapensée was actually a draft dodger named Albert.|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} further self-referential material, as a {{film about}} a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing Miller's Crossing). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, {{but he does not}} heed it. However, when he puts the mysterious package on his writing desk (which might have contained her head), <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> helping him posthumously, in other ways. The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with Mayhew's scripts, Barton Fink contains a [...] "good wrestler" [...] (Barton, it seems) and a [...] "bad wrestler" [...] (Charlie) who [...] "confront" [...] each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his [...] "common man" [...] neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the [...] "simple morality tales" [...] and [...] "road maps" [...] offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2012, a {{woman who}} self-administered an {{abortion}} drug when 39 weeks pregnant was convicted of unlawful abortion under the 1861 Act. The sentencing judge remarked that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> equally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> charged with child destruction.|$|R
50|$|According to the German {{writer and}} socialite Marie von Bunsen (1860-1941), Princess Marie <b>is</b> {{reported}} to <b>have</b> {{had a relationship}} with the Baden politician Franz von Roggenbach (1825-1907) to whom <b>she</b> even <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> married morganatically after her husband's death.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked down}} at his knee and {{scratched}} a patch of grease there. [...] "That's what! I was so blame mad I cut loose of the whole outfit. Once or twice sis had mentioned Nance in a casual kind of way, but as I didn't bite--she had quit fishin', and so I was all in the dark about her. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>been</b> dead or married or crazy, for all I knew. However, now that I was on my way back with nineteen thousand dollars in the bank and a good show for more, I kind o' got to wonderin' what she was sufferin' at." ...|$|R
500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there were}} laws dealing with epikleroi prior to Solon's {{legislative}} activity around 594 BCE. According to the 1st century CE writer Plutarch, Solon authored legislation covering the epikleros. Solon's laws attempted to prevent the combination of estates by the marriage of heiresses. Modern historians have seen this {{as part of an}} effort by Solon to maintain a stable number of households. According to Plutarch, Solon also legislated that the husband of an epikleros must have sexual intercourse with her at least three times a month in order to provide her with children to inherit her father's property, but by the time of Pericles (d. 429 BCE) this law is definitely attested. It is unclear whether or not the nearest relative had the power to dissolve an epikleros' [...] previous marriage in order to marry her himself in all cases. The historian Sarah Pomeroy states that most scholars lean towards the opinion that the nearest relative could only dissolve the previous marriage if the heiress had not yet given birth to a son, but Pomeroy also states that this opinion has not yet been definitely proven. Roger Just disagrees and has argued that even if the epikleros had a son she could still be forced to marry her nearest relative. Athenian law also required that if the next of kin did not marry the heiress, he had to provide her with a dowry. It may have been Solon who legislated that if the new spouse was unable to fulfill his thrice monthly duties to his wife, she was entitled to have sex with his next of kin so that she could produce an heir to her father's property. Alternatively, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> required to divorce and marry the next nearest relative.|$|E
2500|$|Neferu II ("The beautiful") {{was called}} [...] "King's wife" [...] and hmt-nswt-mryt.f, [...] "King's wife, his beloved". <b>She</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Mentuhotep II's sister since she also bore {{the titles of}} s3t-nswt-smswt-n-kht.f, [...] "Eldest king {{daughter}} of his body", irjt-p3t, [...] "hereditary princess" [...] and hmwt-nbwt, [...] "mistress of all women".|$|E
2500|$|Borisenko {{descended to}} see if he could find her. No {{parachute}} was seen, and no explosion, yet she never returned from the mission. Litvyak was 21 years old. Soviet authorities suspected that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured, a possibility that prevented them from awarding her the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|E
60|$|Rose {{lay back}} in the chair with the robe drawn about her, looking the grande dame from her crown of hair to the tasseled toes of her slippers. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Colombe on the eve of her birthday.|$|R
50|$|The raid {{brought some}} amount of fame to Wabe.

60|$|Joan {{started to}} cross {{to him when}} Kells strode between them. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> there, for all the sign this ominous man gave of her presence. He confronted Roberts {{in the middle of}} the camp-circle, and halted, perhaps a rod distant.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, Mimi Pollak's estate {{released}} 60 letters Garbo {{had written}} her in their long correspondence. Several letters suggest {{she may have}} had romantic feelings for Pollak for many years. After learning of Pollak's pregnancy in 1930, for example, Garbo wrote [...] "We cannot help our nature, as God has created it. But I have always thought you and I belonged together". [...] In 1975, she wrote a poem {{about not being able}} to touch the hand of her friend with whom <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> walking through life.|$|E
2500|$|At the Atlanta Games, American {{swimming}} officials criticized Ireland's Michelle Smith {{about her}} unexpected gold medals , suggesting that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> using performance-enhancing drugs. [...] When {{asked about the}} accusations, Evans said that when anyone like Smith showed such a significant improvement, [...] "there's always that question." [...] American sportswriters sympathetic to Smith took this comment to mean that Evans was accusing Smith of steroid use as well , and they attacked Evans as being a sore loser. [...] Evans later insisted that she meant no such accusation and that her remarks were taken out of context. [...] In 1998, Smith received a four-year suspension for tampering with a urine sample.|$|E
2500|$|A sickly child named Conradin {{is raised}} by his aunt and guardian, Mrs De Ropp, who [...] "would never... have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dimly aware that thwarting him 'for his good' was a duty which she did not find {{particularly}} irksome". Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his pole-cat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that [...] "Sredni Vashtar" [...] will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts {{to dispose of the}} animal, it attacks and kills her. [...] The entire household is shocked and alarmed, but Conradin calmly butters another piece of toast.|$|E
