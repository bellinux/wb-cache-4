5|$|Robinson was {{an angel}} investor, {{particularly}} {{in the fields of}} digital communications and biotechnology. In 1999, he funded OmniMetrix and Mission Communications, two companies focused on AMPS cellular digital control channel and wireless <b>SCADA</b> communications. Omnimetrix was acquired by Acorn Energy in 2012. Mission is currently the leading provider of cellular <b>SCADA</b> for water and wastewater in North America. In 2000, he invested $1.5 million in Genomic Solutions Inc, which was acquired by Digilab, Inc. in 2007. Most recently, Robinson was an investor in and co-founder of the 2007 VentureLab startup, C2 Biofuels, which attracted additional funding from Chevron and aims to build several $100million cellulosic ethanol plants throughout the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{entirety}} of the Stuxnet code {{has not yet}} been disclosed, but its payload targets only those <b>SCADA</b> configurations that meet criteria that it is programmed to identify.|$|E
25|$|The worm {{initially}} spreads indiscriminately, but {{includes a}} highly specialized malware payload {{that is designed}} to target only Siemens supervisory control and data acquisition (<b>SCADA)</b> systems that are configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes. Stuxnet infects PLCs by subverting the Step-7 software application that is used to reprogram these devices.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet is a {{malicious}} computer worm, first {{uncovered in}} 2010 by Kaspersky Labs, the antivirus company. Thought {{to have been}} in development since at least 2005, stuxnet targets <b>SCADA</b> systems and was responsible for causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear program. Although neither country has admitted responsibility, since 2012 the worm is frequently described as a jointly built American/Israeli cyberweapon.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the infection, Iran assembled a team to combat it. With more than 30,000 IP addresses affected in Iran, an official said that the infection was fast spreading in Iran and the problem had been compounded by the ability of Stuxnet to mutate. Iran had set up its own systems to clean up infections and had advised against using the Siemens <b>SCADA</b> antivirus since it is suspected that the antivirus was actually embedded with codes which update Stuxnet instead of eradicating it.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Alstom {{was awarded}} an {{additional}} $117m 5-year contract with MARTA to upgrade its train control and <b>SCADA</b> systems. The {{new technology is}} designed to provide MARTA’s rail team with more efficient operations, better communication between trains and stations, enhanced monitoring capabilities, quicker response times, and reduced maintenance costs. Included in the project is an upgrade for all 318 rail cars to install an enhanced Fault Identification and Monitoring System (FIMS) and full color driver’s display built by Quester Tangent. The new systems passed “mini fleet” testing in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Implementing the reforms. With {{the passing}} of the reforms, tariffs in Greater Cairo were {{increased}} from an extremely low base level by 100% as a signal to donors that the reforms were serious. The Holding Company started a program to replace 800,000 non-functioning meters, created a central laboratory, procured <b>SCADA</b> and GIS systems for the public companies and established customer hotlines. Furthermore, the Holding Company established a performance benchmarking system including bonus payments that are paid to companies that improve their performance. As a result of the reforms, donors re-engaged in the sector.|$|E
25|$|Namma Metro was {{the second}} rail {{transport}} system in India (the first was Kolkata Metro) to use 750 V DC third rail traction. In December 2009, the ABB Group was awarded the contract to provide power solutions for {{the first phase of}} the planned metro network. ABB designed, supplied, installed and commissioned four substations that receive and distribute electricity, each rated at 66/33 kV, as well as the auxiliary and traction substations. ABB also provided an integrated network management system, or <b>SCADA</b> (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), to monitor and control the installations. The BMRC currently pays BESCOM 5.7 per unit of electricity.|$|E
25|$|According to {{researcher}} Ralph Langner, once {{installed on}} a Windows system Stuxnet infects project files belonging to Siemens' WinCC/PCS 7 <b>SCADA</b> control software (Step7), and subverts a key communication library of WinCC called s7otbxdx.dll. Doing so intercepts communications between the WinCC software running under Windows {{and the target}} Siemens PLC devices that the software is able to configure and program when the two are connected via a data cable. In this way, the malware is able to install itself on PLC devices unnoticed, and subsequently to mask its presence from WinCC if the control software attempts to read an infected block of memory from the PLC system.|$|E
25|$|The PackML (Packaging Machinery Language) sub-committee’s {{focus was}} to develop a method to quickly {{integrate}} a line of machines without concern on what field bus (protocol & media-the domain of the PackConnect sub-committee) was going to carry the data set between machines, <b>SCADA</b> and MES. After several iterations the approach taken was to extend the ISA S88 Part 1 State Model concept to the Packaging Industry. Later in the development process, the concept of PackTags was introduced to provide a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements used within the state model. PackTags are used for machine-to-machine communications; for example between a Filler and a Capper. In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations. PackTags can be used to provide data exchange between machines and higher level information systems like Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{specifically}} targets {{programmable logic}} controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific {{and it could be}} tailored as a platform for attacking modern supervisory control and data acquisition (<b>SCADA)</b> and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (<b>SCADA)</b> interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have also}} {{referred}} to several clues in the code such as a concealed reference to the word [...] "MYRTUS", believed {{to refer to the}} Myrtle tree, or Hadassah in Hebrew. Hadassah was the birth name of the former Jewish queen of Persia, Queen Esther. However, {{it may be that the}} [...] "MYRTUS" [...] reference is simply a misinterpreted reference to <b>SCADA</b> components known as RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) and that this reference is actually [...] "My RTUs"–a management feature of <b>SCADA.</b> Also, the number 19790509 appears once in the code and might refer to the date [...] "1979 May 09", the day Habib Elghanian, a Persian Jew, was executed in Tehran. Another date that appears in the code is [...] "24 September 2007", the day that Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia University and made comments questioning the validity of the Holocaust. Such data is not conclusive, since, as noted by Symantec, [...] "...attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party".|$|E
2500|$|The depot {{is located}} at Nunnery Square and {{occupies}} the former carriage sidings alongside the Sheffield-Lincoln railway line. It was designed and constructed by Balfour Beatty on [...] of land and consists of a three-line workshop building, six stabling sidings, a turning loop, engineers sidings and sundry equipment. The main offices and reception, supervisor's offices, plant room, staff mess rooms, paint shop, first aid are {{on the first floor}} level on the South side of the building. The south-west of the building is home to the Operations and Power Controller's office, where live control of the running of the service is monitored using <b>SCADA,</b> CCTV and radio contact. The depot substation is also located in the south-west corner, two 600kVA transformer-rectifiers supply the tramway overhead and an 800kVA transformer feeds the depot facilities.|$|E
2500|$|The MRT was {{constructed}} under a concession concept. For the first MRT line, officially known as Chaloem Ratchamongkhon or informally as the [...] "Blue Line", most civil infrastructure {{were provided by}} the government sector, Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA), and handed over to their concessionaire under a 25-year concession agreement. Bangkok Expressway and Metro Public Company Limited (BEM) was the only private sector company that won a bid in MRTA's concession contract for the blue line. As MRTA's concessionaire, BEM provides M equipment, including electrical trains, signalling systems, <b>SCADA,</b> communication, PSD, etc. for the subway project and fully operates the system. To maintain the system, BEM has subcontracted in 10 years to Siemens which was the M system supplier since system opening and 7 years maintenance contract to two local maintenance services for north and south line.|$|E
50|$|Eclipse <b>SCADA</b> is an Eclipse Incubator project {{created in}} July 2013, that aims at {{providing}} a full state-of-the-art, open-source <b>SCADA</b> {{system that can}} be used out of the box or as a platform for creating a custom solution. Eclipse <b>SCADA</b> emerged from the openSCADA project, which now provides additional functionality on top of Eclipse <b>SCADA.</b>|$|E

50|$|Level 2 {{contains}} the <b>SCADA</b> software and computing platform. The <b>SCADA</b> software exists only at this supervisory level as control actions are performed automatically by RTUs or PLCs. <b>SCADA</b> control functions are usually restricted to basic overriding or supervisory level intervention. For example, a PLC may control {{the flow of}} cooling water through part of an industrial process to a set point level, but the <b>SCADA</b> system software will allow operators to change the set points for the flow. The <b>SCADA</b> also enables alarm conditions, such as loss of flow or high temperature, to be displayed and recorded. A feedback control loop is directly controlled by the RTU or PLC, but the <b>SCADA</b> software monitors the overall performance of the loop.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SCADA</b> (Supervisory, Control And Data Acquisition) {{software}} systems, such as <b>SCADA</b> VIEW 6000 and <b>SCADA</b> VIEW2, {{were used}} in many Serbian Hydro- and Termal- Power plants(ref.Lit.#1). The <b>SCADA</b> hardware developed and manufactured in the M. Pupin Institute includes ATLAS AT 32 (with Intel 386 microprocessors and VLSI circuitry), ATLAS MAX PLC (Intel 486), ATLAS MTU, Programmable controllers TIMKO (ref.Lit.#2), Atlas-2000, ATLAS XP, ATLAS-NANO, pico-ATLAS modular RTU devices etc.(for details see: ref.Lit.#3 and #4).|$|E
5000|$|The {{increased}} interest in <b>SCADA</b> vulnerabilities has resulted in vulnerability researchers discovering vulnerabilities in commercial <b>SCADA</b> software and more general offensive <b>SCADA</b> techniques presented to the general security community. [...] In electric and gas utility <b>SCADA</b> systems, {{the vulnerability of the}} large installed base of wired and wireless serial communications links is addressed in some cases by applying bump-in-the-wire devices that employ authentication and Advanced Encryption Standard encryption rather than replacing all existing nodes.|$|E
50|$|<b>SCADA</b> {{information}} and command processing was distributed across multiple stations which were connected through a LAN. Information was shared in near real time. Each station {{was responsible for}} a particular task, which reduced the cost as compared to First Generation <b>SCADA.</b> The network protocols used were still not standardized. Since these protocols were proprietary, very few people beyond the developers knew enough to determine how secure a <b>SCADA</b> installation was. Security of the <b>SCADA</b> installation was usually overlooked.|$|E
5000|$|Early <b>SCADA</b> system {{computing}} {{was done}} by large minicomputers. Common network services did not exist at the time <b>SCADA</b> was developed. Thus <b>SCADA</b> systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. The first-generation <b>SCADA</b> system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all the Remote Terminal Unit sites and {{was used in the}} event of failure of the primary mainframe system. [...] Some first generation <b>SCADA</b> systems were developed as [...] "turn key" [...] operations that ran on minicomputers such as the PDP-11 series made by the Digital Equipment Corporation..|$|E

5000|$|Many vendors of <b>SCADA</b> {{and control}} {{products}} {{have begun to}} address the risks posed by unauthorized access by developing lines of specialized industrial firewall and VPN solutions for TCP/IP-based <b>SCADA</b> networks as well as external <b>SCADA</b> monitoring and recording equipment.The International Society of Automation (ISA) started formalizing <b>SCADA</b> security requirements in 2007 with a working group, WG4. WG4 [...] "deals specifically with unique technical requirements, measurements, and other features required to evaluate and assure security resilience and performance of industrial automation and control systems devices".|$|E
50|$|Outage {{management}} systems are also commonly integrated with <b>SCADA</b> systems which can automatically report {{the operation of}} monitored circuit breakers and other intelligent devices such as <b>SCADA</b> reclosers.|$|E
50|$|Inductive Automation {{introduced}} the server-centric architecture for <b>SCADA</b> systems with FactorySQL and FactoryPMI in 2003.

50|$|<b>SCADA</b> {{systems are}} used to control and monitor {{physical}} processes, examples of which are transmission of electricity, transportation of gas and oil in pipelines, water distribution, traffic lights, and other systems {{used as the basis}} of modern society. The security of these <b>SCADA</b> systems is important because compromise or destruction of these systems would impact multiple areas of society far removed from the original compromise. For example, a blackout caused by a compromised electrical <b>SCADA</b> system would cause financial losses to all the customers that received electricity from that source. How security will affect legacy <b>SCADA</b> and new deployments remains to be seen.|$|E
50|$|As an {{embedded}} protocol the ICCP management {{tools and}} interfaces {{are all part}} of the complete suite of tools for the <b>SCADA.</b> This configuration offers maximum performance because of the direct access to the <b>SCADA</b> database without requiring any intervening buffering. This approach may not be available as an addition to a legacy system. The ICCP application may be restricted to accessing only the <b>SCADA</b> environment in which it is embedded.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} threat vectors {{to a modern}} <b>SCADA</b> system. One is the threat of {{unauthorized}} access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting <b>SCADA</b> devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of cryptographic security, allowing an attacker to control a <b>SCADA</b> device by sending commands over a network. In many cases <b>SCADA</b> users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network jacks and switches. Industrial control vendors suggest approaching <b>SCADA</b> security like Information Security with a defense in depth strategy that leverages common IT practices.|$|E
50|$|<b>SCADA</b> {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used combinations {{of radio and}} direct wired connections, although SONET/SDH is also frequently used for large systems such as railways and power stations. The remote management or monitoring function of a <b>SCADA</b> system {{is often referred to}} as telemetry. Some users want <b>SCADA</b> data to travel over their pre-established corporate networks or to share the network with other applications. The legacy of the early low-bandwidth protocols remains, though.|$|E
50|$|In {{renewable}} energies the merger with Garrad Hassan provided a software solution set for turbine design (GH Bladed), wind farm design (GH WindFarmer), and a <b>SCADA</b> System (GH <b>SCADA)</b> that can integrate data from all major turbine manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|In {{parallel}} with this, distribution utilities began {{to roll out}} Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (<b>SCADA)</b> systems, initially only at their higher voltage substations. Over time, use of <b>SCADA</b> has progressively extended downwards to sites at lower voltage levels.|$|E
5000|$|A {{programmable}} automation controller (PAC) is {{a compact}} controller that combines the features and capabilities of a PC-based control system {{with that of}} a typical PLC. PACs are deployed in <b>SCADA</b> systems to provide RTU and PLC functions. In many electrical substation <b>SCADA</b> applications, [...] "distributed RTUs" [...] use information processors or station computers to communicate with digital protective relays, PACs, and other devices for I/O, and communicate with the <b>SCADA</b> master in lieu of a traditional RTU.|$|E
