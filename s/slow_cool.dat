40|$|In {{the solar}} atmosphere, the jets are {{ubiquitous}} {{and found to}} be at various spatia-temporal scales. They are significant to understand energy and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Recently, the high-speed transition region jets are reported from the observation. Here we conduct a numerical simulation to investigate the mechanism in their formation. Driven by the supergranular convection motion, the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open flux occurring in the transition region is simulated with a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model. The simulation results show that not only a fast hot jet, much resemble the found transition region jets, but also a adjacent <b>slow</b> <b>cool</b> jet, mostly like classical spicules, is launched. The force analysis shows that the fast hot jet is continually driven by the Lorentz force around the reconnection region, while the <b>slow</b> <b>cool</b> jet is induced by an initial kick through the Lorentz force associated with the emerging magnetic flux. Also, {{the features of the}} driven jets change with the amount of the emerging magnetic flux, giving the varieties of both jets. These results will inspire our understanding of the formation of the prevalence of both the fast hot jet and <b>slow</b> <b>cool</b> jet from the solar transition region and chromosphere.

The {{effect of the}} crucible during solidification {{and the influence of}} different cooling rates is described. To clarify in which process steps {{residual strain}} accumulates, several Si ingots were grown in a laboratory scale furnace (Ø 100 mm) using different cooling conditions after completion of the solidification. For the cooling, two different cooling rates were distinguished: fast cooling (12 C/min) and <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> (5 C/min). It was found that changes in cooling gradients greatly influence the amount of residual strain. The results show that <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> in any temperature range leads to strain reduction.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{phenomenon}} of ridging {{is known to}} occur in most ferritic stainless steels and is manifested during deformation of sheet material. It results {{in the formation of}} a corrugated profile with ridges always elongated in the rolling direction of the sheet and are typically around 1 mm in wavelength. The formation of a ridged profile, while not having a detrimental effect of the mechanical properties, results in the product having an unatractive surface finish. Thus there is a drive to find a thermomechanical process to minimise the severity of ridging in the final sheet product. In this regard, the purpose of this investigation was to establish the influence of three thermomechanical (TMP) variables on the ridging severity. The samples in this investigation represented: two zones of the initial starting structure, with equiaxed of solunar grains; four hot rolling finish temperatures (HRFT), 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C; and two colling methods after hot rolling, quench and <b>slow</b> <b>cool</b> versus <b>slow</b> <b>cool.</b> Each sample completed the TMP cycle, was elongated to 20 % strain and the topography on the surface measured and compared...|$|E

40|$|Undoped, low-pressure, liquid-encapsulated Czochralski GaAs can be {{reversibly}} {{changed from}} conducting (ρ ∼ 1 Ω-cm) to semi-insulating (ρ ∼ 107 Ω-cm) by either slow or fast cooling, respectively, after a 5 hr, 950 ° C soak in an evacuated quartz ampoule. The semi-insulating wafers are very uniform {{and lead to}} tight threshold-voltage control in direct-implant MESFET’s. We have studied crystals in both states by temperature-dependent Hall effect, photoluminescence, IR absorption, mass spectroscopy, and DLTS. It is shown that donor and acceptor concentrations are typically more than {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the C and Si concentrations, which are both less than 3 × 1014 cm− 3. The EL 2 concentration remains relatively constant at about 1. 0 × 1016 cm− 3. Thus, the normal EL 2 -Si-C compensation model does not apply. The most likely explanation for the reversibility involves a delicate balance between native-defect donors and acceptors in equilibrium at 950 ° C, but with the donors dominating after a <b>slow</b> <b>cool,</b> and the acceptors after a fast cool. A consistent model includes a dominant donor at Ec 0. 13 eV, probably VAs – AsGa, and a dominant acceptor at Ev + 0. 07 eV, probably VGa GaAs. In this model, vacancy motion is very important during the <b>slow</b> <b>cool.</b> Such processes must be strongly considered in the growth of bulk, high-purity GaAs...|$|E

The kinetic model identified structure development to be first order, displaying multiple steps during cooling. By distinguishing the data into two regions with respect to gelation, the activation energies for these two regimes were estimated for four protein concentrations. At <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rates and higher concentrations prior to gelation, the activation energies were higher, corresponding with {{a greater number of}} particle collisions prior to floc formation. This trend was reversed after gelation: a lower activation energy was observed for <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rates and higher concentrations. This observation resulted from a higher order of flocs at a <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rate and more flocs at a higher concentration, simplifying floc cross-linking. ...|$|R
