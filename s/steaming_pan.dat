[...] Wok cooking is done with long-handled utensils called chahn (spatula) or hoak (ladle). The long handles of these utensils allow cooks to work with the food without burning their hands.|$|E
50|$|Fixing or “kill-green” {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} enzymatic {{browning}} of the wilted leaves is controlled through the application of heat. It is held that the longer it takes to fix the leaves, the more aromatic will be the tea. Fixing is carried out via <b>steaming,</b> <b>pan</b> firing, baking or with the use of heated tumblers. Application of steam heats the leaves more quickly that pan firing, as a result of which steamed teas taste ‘green’ and vegetal while the pan-fired ones taste toasty. This procedure is carried out for green teas and yellow teas.|$|E

In 1851, confectioners began to use a revolving <b>steam</b> <b>pan</b> to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The heat {{from the surface of the}} pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business.|$|R

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by <b>steaming</b> or <b>pan</b> cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|R
40|$|For {{long time}} {{vegetables}} were thought only {{as sources of}} several vitamins; however, {{it has been shown}} that vegetables contain other component, which is also important for maintaining body's health, i. e., dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is a group of polysaccharides oan other polymers, which cannot be digested by upper gastro-intestinal system of human. Dietary fiber can be grouped as soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, showing in different physiological effect. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) is effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, while insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) can prevent the development of colon cancer, diverticulosis as well as obesity. Local vegetables found to contain high SDF (higher than 3, 06 % db) are: watercress, green bean, carrot, eggplant, lettuce, broccoli, spinach, string bean, and aubergine; while which contain high IDF (higher than 40, 60 % db) are: winged bean, watercress, chinese leaves, katuk leaves, lettuce, green bean, broccoli, carrot and spinach. Cooking (i. e. boiling, <b>steaming</b> and <b>pan</b> frying) decrease the IDF content of vegetables, while their SDF content is not affected by cooking treatments...|$|R
50|$|These {{operate with}} a {{spring-loaded}} valve {{that is often}} hidden from view in a proprietary mechanism. This generation is characterized by two or more pressure settings. Some of these pressure cookers do not release any steam during operation (non-venting) and instead use a rising indicator with markings to show the pressure level. These only release <b>steam</b> when the <b>pan</b> is opened, or as a safety precaution if the heat source is not reduced enough when the pan reaches the required cooking pressure. Others use a dial that the operator can advance by a few clicks (which alters the spring tension) to change the pressure setting or release pressure; these release steam during operation (venting).|$|R
40|$|Bagasse is a {{renewable}} fuel and is essentially greenhouse gas neutral because {{the carbon dioxide}} produced during bagasse combustion is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the photosynthesis of sugarcane in the field.

40|$|MOST PAN {{stages in}} Australian {{factories}} use only {{five or six}} batch pans for the high grade massecuite production and operate these in a fairly rigid repeating production schedule. It is common {{that some of the}} pans are of large dropping capacity e. g. 150 to 240 t. Because of the relatively small number and large sizes of the <b>pans,</b> <b>steam</b> consumption varies widely through the schedule, often by ± 30 % about the mean value. Large fluctuations in steam consumption have implications for the steam generation/condensate management of the factory and the evaporators when bleed vapour is used. One of the objectives of a project to develop a supervisory control system for a pan stage is to (a) reduce the average steam consumption and (b) reduce the variation in the steam consumption. The operation of each of the high grade pans within the schedule at Macknade Mill was analysed to determine the idle (or buffer) time, time allocations for essential but unproductive operations (e. g. pan turn round, charging, slow ramping up of <b>steam</b> rates on <b>pan</b> start etc.), and productive time i. e. the time during boil-on of liquor and molasses feed. Empirical models were developed for each high grade pan on the stage to define the interdependence of the production rate and the evaporation rate for the different phases of each pan’s cycle. The data were analysed in a spreadsheet model to try to reduce and smooth the total steam consumption. This paper reports on the methodology developed in the model and the results of the investigations for the pan stage at Macknade Mill. It was found that the operation of the schedule severely restricted the ability to reduce the average steam consumption and smooth the steam flows. While longer cycle times provide increased flexibility the steam consumption profile was changed only slightly. The ability to cut massecuite on the run among pans, or the use of a high grade seed vessel, would assist in reducing the average steam consumption and the magnitude of the variations in steam flow...|$|R

Food is cooked and then cooled and stored for later service. Improper or "slow" cooling has been identified by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as a contributing factor in foodborne illness outbreaks. This {{study was designed to}} test the efficacy of cooling technique combinations on controlling microbial growth within pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, low sodium marinara sauce, and brown rice food products. These products were cooked to 73. 8 °C (165 °F) and then portioned to 2 and 3 -inch depths in <b>steam</b> table <b>pans.</b> Food product was allowed to cool to 60 °C ± 5 °C (140 °F ± 5 °F) before inoculation with surrogate Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Biosafety Level I (BSL I) Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). Pans were uncovered or covered with one or two layers of aluminum foil to allow or restrict air exposure and then placed in a - 20 °C (- 4 °F) commercial walk-in freezer or situated in ice water baths in a commercial walk-in refrigerator 4 °C (39. 2 °F). Food products were sampled over a 24 -hour period (0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hour time points) for enumeration of microbial populations. Conclusions from the cooling temperature data in this study revealed uncovered pans and pans stored in the freezer at 2 -inch food product depths cooled most rapidly. However, few cooling methods achieved the two-step US FDA Food Code requirement for pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, and brown rice products and none of the cooling methods tested achieved the US FDA food code requirement for low sodium marinara sauce. Surrogate E. coli and BSL I B. cereus microbial population data revealed pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, and brown rice products all exhibited a certain degree of overall population decline during the 24 -hour cooling period. However, a small recovery of surrogate E. coli population was observed in the low sodium marinara sauce product as well as 2 -inch product depths of the chili con carne with beans product. This observed growth was less than 0. 50 log₁₀ CFU/g, indicating low risk for microbial proliferation from the cooling methods tested. It is possible that the surrogate E. coli and BSL I B. cereus population changes observed were not the result of cooling failure or risk, but rather due to natural variations within the food products. These results indicate all 12 cooling methods tested were low risk and therefore effective at controlling E. coli and B. cereus microbial populations within the four food products...|$|R
