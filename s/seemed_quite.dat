5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E

25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> distressed and, apparently, made a new will — which no one can find. She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E
25|$|The BC Express began {{a weekly}} round trip service from Fort Gorge to Tête Jaune Cache, {{carrying}} capacity loads of freight and passengers. The passenger fare was $35, meals and berths extra, and the freight rate was $80 a ton. This latter <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with {{no guarantee that}} the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had a very interesting season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> possible.|$|E

500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|McKellen {{was born}} on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior. Shortly before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted. The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that [...] "only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal." [...] When an interviewer remarked that he <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> calm in the aftermath of 11 September attacks, McKellen said: [...] "Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old." [...] Even though he only lived in Bolton for less than seven years, as opposed to the eleven years [...] in Wigan beforehand, he refers to Bolton as his [...] "Hometown".|$|E

We were referring to it as 'sexual intimidation,' 'sexual coercion,' 'sexual exploitation on the job.' None of those names <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> right. We wanted something that embraced a whole range of subtle and un-subtle persistent behaviors. Somebody came up with 'harassment.' 'Sexual harassment!' Instantly we agreed.

Sleeping on lice-infested straw. Arriving on 10 October 1944, Misuraca and two other U.S. officers made an escape on 1 November.

Then an U.S. Legation officer drove them to Genève at the border to France, and on 15 November they reached the Allied lines.|$|E

[...] Three days later the tactic seemed to be working as General Sir Hubert Gough's Fifth Army was overwhelmed and it <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> likely that the Germans would break through the French and British lines.

In On the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote that to use natural selection to explain something as complicated as a human eye, [...] "with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration" [...] might at first appear [...] "absurd in the highest possible degree," [...] but nevertheless, if [...] "numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist", then it <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> possible to account for within his theory.|$|E
2500|$|Einstein's {{description}} of light as being composed of particles extended Planck's notion of quantised energy, {{which is that}} a single photon of a given frequency, , delivers an invariant amount of energy, [...] In other words, individual photons can deliver more or less energy, but only depending on their frequencies. In nature, single photons are rarely encountered. The Sun and emission sources available in the 19th century emit vast numbers of photons every second, and so {{the importance of the}} energy carried by each individual photon was not obvious. Einstein's idea that the energy contained in individual units of light depends on their frequency made it possible to explain experimental results that had hitherto <b>seemed</b> <b>quite</b> counterintuitive. However, although the photon is a particle, it was still being described as having the wave-like property of frequency. Once again, the particle account of light was being compromised.|$|E
