[...] —Chuck Jones on Bugs Bunny's catchphrase [...] "What's up Doc?" [...] The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs' most well-known catchphrase, [...] "What's up, Doc?", which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny film, A Wild Hare (1940). Avery explained later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters, the [...] "What's up, Doc?" [...] scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction. As a result, the scene became a recurring element in subsequent cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for a situation. For example, Bugs says [...] "What's up, dogs?" [...] to the antagonists in A Hare Grows in Manhattan, [...] "What's up, Duke?" [...] to the knight in Knight-mare Hare, and [...] "What's up, prune-face?" [...] to the aged Elmer in The Old Grey Hare. He might also greet Daffy with [...] "What's up, Duck?"

40|$|<b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when an {{employer}} refuses to negotiate an enterprise agreement? … It appears that you {{resort to the}} law of the jungle and commence an industrial campaign aimed at forcing them to the negotiating table because {{the law of the land}} is a lame duck on the issue’ (Nadenbousch, 1995 : 3). The doctrine of ‘bargaining in good faith ’ during the negotiation process for a collective agreement is examined. In particular, the paper explores how the doctrine has changed in its meaning over the years. Some recent cases of collective bargaining in Australia under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 are examined to determine the extent to which bargaining in good faith is taken into consideration. The paper finds that, over the years, employers have taken little or no consideration of bargaining in good faith. This is particularly evident in the way in which employers have used Australia Workplace Agreements (AWAs) as a (new) bargaining tool in situations where negotiations for a collective agreement have been exhausted and/or when employers seek to secure an outcome that is more favourable. The paper suggests that the enterprise bargaining guidelines under the federal Workplace Relations Act 1993 are more open-ended, resulting in conduct that i...|$|E

To help women better understand the range of possible responses, this study explores how women in Public Relations respond to identity questions that involve both their work and personal lives. I begin by situating the study within relevant literature on entrepreneurship, female business owners, the history {{of women in the}} workplace, work/life issues, Public Relations, the use of language to construct work identity, and structuration theory. I conducted one-on-one qualitative interviews as my methodology. Next, I discuss how my research questions led to a variety of often paradoxical findings including: (a) business owners who perceive mothering as their primary role; (b) the development of the 2 ̆ 2 unplanned organization; 2 ̆ 2 (c) business ownership as a phenomenon that seemingly offers more opportunities, but also constrains people in unexpected ways; (d) the emergence of nontraditional work arrangements, which continue to experience some resistance; (e) the idea that advisers can be peers or colleagues; (f) new labels, such as virtual work and virtual agency, that describe individuals 2 ̆ 7 roles but raise lingering questions about societal perceptions of work; (g) how framing and sensemaking can offer women tools to account for the discontinuities in their narratives...|$|E

40|$|Function-style macros are macros {{that can}} be used within a SAS statement. Although such macros are {{extremely}} flexible, they can only use macro language code. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if you need a macro {{that can be}} embedded within a SAS statement, but the underlying task requires the execution of one or more DATA or PROC steps? You can now leverage the capabilities of user-written SAS functions to circumvent this limitation, meaning that your macros can now have the flexibility of a function-style interface while still being able to execute one or more SAS steps in the background. This paper describes the necessary techniques for developing such macros and provides examples of situations where they can be most beneficial. FIRST, A WORD OF WARNING The techniques described in this paper should work, but I have run into some technical issues in trying to implement them. Therefore, through at least the first maintenance release of SAS 9. 3 (TS 1 M 1), you will need to exercise some care when employing these methods, taking into consideration the issues that are mentioned in this section. According to SAS Technical Support, these problems will be rectified in a later release of SAS. In SAS 9. 2, the most direct limitation is that values passed from a user-written function to a macro through the RUN_MACRO function cannot be longer than 262 characters. This is problematic for situations where a list o...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} nature of Terrorism, this author will deal with {{suggested}} points 6) the Sociology of terrorism, and 3) religion and ethnic hostility. In his presidential address at the Society for Scientific Study of Religion, sociologist Rodney Start (JSSR, 2004) exhorted delegates to broaden the theories of Durkheim, Marx and Weber, which I will do as well. So this paper will first deal with the sociology of terrorism, and then more specifically focus on multiculturalism and religion. Durkheim was concerned with solidarity and the efforts of many minorities to solidify separate identities, important in promoting multiculturalism. Karl Marx was concerned that such multiple boundaried identities would become targets and lead to much conflict. Max Weber focused on social psychological influences such as the Protestant “ethic ” and the “spirit ” of capitalism, which called for flexible ideological networks. Durkheim thought religion was central to solidarity. Marx thought it was “an opiate ” which stupefied humans into conflict and lack of concern for others. Max Weber thought Protestant individualism led to individual work “ethic”, and a “spirit ” of capitalism. Bruce Chilton (2008) says the three monotheist religions (Jews, Christians and Muslims) all trace their roots back to Abraham, but as cousins constantly fight each other. Belief in one God, results in many individual interpretations, so freedom often leads to individualism and conflict. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when terrorists use methods of violence and sacrifice their lives, believing their God will reward them for it?

40|$|As a rock star, I {{have two}} instincts, I {{want to have}} fun, and I {{want to change the}} world. I have a chance to do both. ” —Bono, main vocalist of the rock band U 2 Suppose you are a passionate {{language}} teacher brimming with confidence. You are proud of your English pedagogy know-how, enthusiasm for culture and languages, and awareness of your students ’ chal-lenges and goals; however, as the years pass, the daily routine of teaching the same material {{day in and day out}} starts to diminish the passion that was once so prominent years earlier. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> You do what so many of us have done when times get dull: you recharge the batteries and break the routine of daily instruction. A fun and interactive experience that combines an English instructor’s love of cultural awareness with a student’s curiosity about cultural diversity is the perfect way to fracture that circle of potential apathy. In this article, I will share with you a content-based English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) workshop that strengthens language acquisition, increases intrinsic moti-vation, and bridges cultural divides. I will use a rock and roll workshop to introduce an organizational approach with a primary emphasis on cultural awareness content and a secondary emphasis on language development. It is important to point out that even though rock and roll history is a main focus of this article, any cultural con-tent of the teacher’s choosing may be substituted. Rationale for content-based workshops The beauty of being a language instructor is that we are so much more than just dictionaries or gram-marians; we are the bridges of cul-tural divides, we are the delegates of social communication, and above all, we are agents of social responsibility and change. Not only do language instructors guide learners down the right path to achieve their acquisitio...|$|E
