50|$|Somatotropic cells {{constitute}} 20% of anterior pituitary cells. They release {{growth hormone}} (GH) {{in response to}} Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH, or <b>somatocrinin)</b> or are inhibited by GHIH (somatostatin), both received from the hypothalamus via the hypophyseal portal system vein and the secondary plexus.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), {{also known}} as <b>somatocrinin</b> or by several other names in its {{endogenous}} forms and as somatorelin (INN) in its pharmaceutical form, is a releasing hormone of growth hormone (GH). It is a 44-amino acid peptide hormone produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.|$|E
50|$|Secretion {{of growth}} hormone (GH) in the {{pituitary}} is {{regulated by the}} neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothalamus. These cells release the peptides Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or <b>somatocrinin)</b> and Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH or somatostatin) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary.GH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, {{which in turn is}} affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion.|$|E
5000|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic axis (HPS axis), or hypothalamic-pituitary-somatic axis, {{also known}} as the hypothalamic-pituitary-growth axis, is a hypothalamic-pituitary axis which {{includes}} the secretion of growth hormone (GH; somatotropin) from the somatotropes of the pituitary gland into the circulation and the subsequent stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; somatomedin-1) production by GH in tissues such as, namely, the liver. Other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; <b>somatocrinin),</b> growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH; somatostatin), and ghrelin (...) are involved in the control of GH secretion from the pituitary gland. The HPS axis is involved in postnatal human growth. Individuals with growth hormone deficiency or Laron syndrome ( [...] insensitivity) show symptoms like short stature, dwarfism and obesity, but are also protected from cancer. Conversely, acromegaly and gigantism are conditions of GH and IGF-1 excess usually due to a pituitary tumor, and are characterized by overgrowth and tall stature.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} growth hormone release by synthetic <b>somatocrinin</b> was investigated on purified hog anterior pituitary secretory granules; the granules {{were found to}} contain a cAMP-dependent protein kinase that catalyzed [gamma- 32 P]-ATP histone phosphorylation with maximal rates ranging from 1 to 5 nmol of Pi incorporated per mg of protein per 20 min. The activity of this enzyme was further stimulated by <b>somatocrinin.</b> Stimulation was observed at concentrations as low as 0. 3 pM, and the half-maximal effect was obtained with 35 +/- 8 pM (n = 4). Michaelis-Menten analysis of phosphorylation kinetics suggested that the peptide did not change significantly the reaction's Vmax, but produced {{a dramatic increase in}} enzyme affinity for cAMP: the apparent Km for the nucleotide decreased from 400 X 10 (- 9) M under unstimulated conditions to 15 X 10 (- 9) M in the presence of 100 pM <b>somatocrinin.</b> Furthermore, a Hill plot of concentration-dependence curve indicated the existence of negative cooperativity. At the concentration of 35 pM, the less potent analogs of <b>somatocrinin</b> [designated hpGRF- 44 to indicate source (human pancreas, hp), activity (growth hormone-releasing factor, GRF), and amino acid composition], hpGRF-(1 - 37) and [Phe 1]hpGRF-(1 - 40) had 20 % and 7 %, respectively, of the effect of <b>somatocrinin.</b> The biologically inactive analog hpGRF-(2 - 40) had no evident effect at concentrations up to 0. 1 microM. Therefore, we suggest that <b>somatocrinin</b> stimulation of growth hormone release involves activation of exocytosis through a phosphorylation mechanism mediated by a granular receptor coupled with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the time course for full recovery of the growth hormone governing system and <b>somatocrinin</b> response after anesthesia. Sixteen Yorkshire gilts aged 32 weeks were divided into three groups: saline (n = 6), anesthesia + saline (n = 5) and anesthesia + <b>somatocrinin</b> (n = 5). Under anesthesia, the area under the growth hormone curve was increased (P less than 0. 05) from 1172 +/- 184 to 2807 +/- 1002 ng. min. mL- 1, and a more consistent growth hormone response to <b>somatocrinin</b> was observed; all animals responded immediately, while only three out of five did so four hours before anesthesia. Sixteen and 40 hours after anesthesia, basal and stimulated growth hormone levels were comparable to those of unanesthetized controls, suggesting a prompt recovery from the effects of anesthesia. These data indicate that anesthetized pigs release higher quantities of growth hormone and have a more consistent growth hormone response to <b>somatocrinin.</b> A full recovery of basal and somatocrinin-induced growth hormone release was observed as soon as 16 hours after anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Molecular cloning has {{established}} the primary structures of two precursors {{of the human}} pancreas growth hormone-releasing factor (hpGRF- 44), <b>somatocrinin.</b> Both polypeptides contain the sequence of hpGRF- 44 flanked by basic processing sites. Furthermore, the precursors include a putative signal sequence and a carboxyl-terminal amidation signal for hpGRF- 44. The two forms of mRNA code for pre-pro-GRF- 107 and pre-pro-GRF- 108. Pre-pro-GRF- 108 differs from pre-pro-GRF- 107 by the insertion of a serine in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the precursor. In vitro translation of tumor poly(A) + RNA followed by immunoprecipitation with GRF-specific antiserum and gel electrophoresis showed the molecular weight of preprosomatocrinin to be approximately 13, 000, which is in good agreement with the molecular weight deduced from the sequences of the cDNA clones...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{transcriptional}} control of the growth hormone gene illustrates the complementary role of three types of regulatory proteins. These proteins bind to the gene upstream of the transcription initiation site to stimulate or inhibit transcription. A first type of proteins includes ubiquitous factors. A second type includes receptors for hormones that act in the nucleus. A third type {{is represented by the}} pituitary factor Pit- 1, the prototype of a novel class of proteins that are also involved in controlling embryonic development and cell proliferation. Indeed, Pit- 1 determines not only the tissue specificity of expression of the growth hormone gene, but also its control by <b>somatocrinin,</b> as well as the ontogeny of the anterior pituitary and the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{examine the}} effects of {{anabolic}} agents given during late gestation on the maternal and fetal somatotropic axes, we injected pregnant ewes twice daily with 0. 15 mg <b>somatocrinin</b> (GRF) -(1 - 29) for 10 days beginning on day 130 of gestation. Maternal and fetal endocrine changes were compared with control animals using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Treatment with GRF increased maternal plasma levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I;P less than 0. 05) but not IGF-II. Under in vitro test conditions, maternal pituitary cells showed a greater maximal response (P less than 0. 001) to GRF. In the fetuses of treated ewes, cord plasma GH levels were not significantly increased compared with controls. These animals had similar IGF-I but higher IGF-II (P less than 0. 05) plasma levels. The maximal response of fetal pituitary cells to GRF was increased (P less than 0. 001). GRF treatment had no influence on maternal and fetal pituitary cell responses to somatostatin under either basal or GRF-stimulated conditions. In addition, these treatments did not affect plasma levels of placental lactogen, glucose, or free fatty acids in the maternal and fetal sheep. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that treatment of pregnant ewes in the last days of gestation with GRF could support accelerated fetal growth...|$|E
40|$|Context. Although {{pituitary}} autoantibodies {{have frequently}} {{been reported in}} Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 1 (APS 1), the autoimmune involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis remains to be elucidated. Objective. Our aim was to identify in APS 1 patients novel autoantibodies, especially against hypothalamic-pituitary targets, and to correlate their presence with clinical features. Patients. We analyzed 14 APS 1 patients from Sardinia, compared to other diseases and healthy donors. Measure(s). We used immunohistochemistry, on tissues substrates from various neuroendocrine organs, to detect autoantibody targets. Immunoenzymatic assays, as well as absorption with specific antigens were used to reveal autoantibodies against growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and <b>somatocrinin</b> (GHRH). Clinical evaluations included GH secretory and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy tests. Results. Sera from 12 / 14 APS 1 patients revealed autoantibodies reacting with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, cerebellum, substantia nigra, and/or adrenal medulla, {{as well as with}} GH, LH and/or GHRH. Of APS 1 patients, 5 showed GH deficiency, in association (4 / 5 cases) with autoantibodies to hypothalamic and/or pituitary targets. Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism was revealed in one APS 1 patient, together with autoantibodies against gonadotropes. Autonomic neuropathy was detected in 5 of 10 patients, associated with autoantibodies to adrenal medulla in 2 cases. Of 5 patients with autoantibodies to cerebellar neurons, 2 reported emotional or memory alterations. Conclusions. The majority of Sardinian APS 1 patients developed autoantibodies to an assortment of neuroendocrine cells. Novel targets of clinical relevance may include pituitary hormones, uncharacterized pituitary targets, and adrenal medullary cells. An high prevalence of GH deficiency, and possibly of autonomic neuropathy, were also revealed...|$|E
