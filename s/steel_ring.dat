5|$|The {{match between}} Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect {{began with a}} series of wrestling holds. The match {{remained}} primarily technical until Diesel distracted Perfect, allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face. Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until Perfect took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, Perfect used the Perfect Plex. Diesel pulled him out of the ring and threw him into the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match, in which the WWF Tag Team Champions Kane and X-Pac defended against Mark Henry and D'Lo Brown. During the match, Henry lifted X-Pac and rammed {{his back against the}} <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> post at ringside. Afterward, Brown and Henry simultaneously attacked X-Pac, which led Kane to launch himself from the top turnbuckle onto Brown and Henry. After the competitors reentered the ring, Kane performed a chokeslam on Henry, lifting him by the throat and slamming him down. Kane then pinned Henry to retain the WWF Tag Team Title. Next was the hardcore singles bout—a match allowing no disqualifications or countouts. WWF Hardcore Champion Al Snow defended against Hardcore Holly. Holly and Snow began their bout in the ring but were scripted to move their brawl into the arena stands. From there, they proceeded to the backstage area, and into the concession stands before returning to the ring. The fight was decided when Snow lifted Holly onto his shoulders and threw him through a wooden table. Successfully covering and pinning Holly, Snow retained the WWF Hardcore Title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event of the night, Daniel Bryan, Batista and Randy Orton faced off in a triple threat match for Orton's WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Orton's {{entrance}} included a live performance by Rev Theory. Orton started by targeting Bryan's injured arm to momentarily neutralize him. With no count-outs in a triple threat match, Batista and Orton battled at ringside; Batista tried for his signature Batista Bomb onto the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps, but Orton countered with a back body drop onto the steps. After Orton and Batista returned to the ring, Bryan made a comeback with a missile dropkick to both men, then peppered his opponents' chests with roundhouse kicks. Bryan then served consecutive corner dropkicks to Orton and Batista, but then was suplexed from the ring to the outside by Batista. Batista and Orton fought again with Orton executing a superplex, but then Bryan immediately returned with a diving headbutt and applied his signature Yes! Lock on Orton.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Orton demanded a rematch, {{threatening}} Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) {{as well as}} their grandchildren. McMahon did not grant him the rematch but scheduled a six-man tag team match for the pay-per-view Backlash between Triple H and Shane and Vince McMahon and The Legacy, with a preview that evening between Vince and Orton. However, Raw's general manager at that time, Vickie Guerrero, made their six-man tag team match a WWE Championship match. The stipulation was that if Triple H's team won, he retained the championship, while if The Legacy won, Orton would win the title. As the singles match progressed, Shane and Triple H came to Vince's aid, causing both Rhodes and DiBiase to interfere until a returning Batista appeared and cleared the ring; McMahon then announced that Batista was to replace him in the match at Backlash. At the event, Orton won by pinning Triple H after an RKO and a running punt, leaving Triple H hospitalized according to the storyline. In spite of Triple H's absence, Shane McMahon continued his feud with the group, leading to another match between him and Orton on Raw. After the original match ended in a no contest due to interference, Rhodes and DiBiase won singles matches to be entered into a handicap match with all of The Legacy facing Shane later that night. This match was used to write him out of the storyline, as The Legacy members used the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps to shatter his ankle.|$|E

40|$|Concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{have been}} widely adopted for column {{construction}} of tall buildings due to its superior strength and ductility performance contributed by the composite action. However, this beneficial composite action cannot be fully developed at early elastic stage as steel dilates more than concrete and thereby causing imperfect interface bonding. Hence, it reduces the elastic strength and stiffness of the CFST columns. To resolve the problem, external confinement {{in the form of}} <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> is proposed in this study to restrict the lateral dilation of concrete and steel at initial elastic stage. In this paper, CFST columns of various dimensions cast with normal-strength or high-strength concrete and installed with external <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> were tested under uni-axial compression. From the results, it was evident that (a) the external <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> could restrict the lateral dilation of CFST columns and improve the interface bonding condition and (b) externally confined CFST columns had uni-axial strength and stiffness larger than those of unconfined CFST columns. With the experimental results, an analytical model taking into account the confining effects of <b>steel</b> tube and <b>rings</b> has been developed to predict the uni-axial strength of ring-confined CFST columns...|$|R
25|$|Samuel Tolver Preston {{illustrated}} {{that many}} of the postulates introduced by Le Sage concerning the gravitational particles, such as rectilinear motion, rare interactions, etc.., could be collected under the single notion that they behaved (on the cosmological scale) as the particles of a gas with an extremely long mean free path. Preston also accepted Kelvin's proposal of internal energy modes of the particles. He illustrated Kelvin's model by comparing it with the collision of a <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> and an anvil - the anvil would not be shaken very much, but the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> would be in a state of vibration and therefore departs with diminished velocity. He also argued, that the mean free path of the particles is at least the distance between the planets - on longer distances the particles regain their translational energy due collisions with each other, so he concluded that on longer distances there would be no attraction between the bodies, independent of their size. Paul Drude suggested that this could possibly be a connection with some theories of Carl Gottfried Neumann and Hugo von Seeliger, who proposed some sort of absorption of gravity in open space.|$|E
25|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was the {{encounter}} of Kane and The Undertaker. Before the match began, Kane attacked The Undertaker {{on the ring}} aisle. Kane then attempted to attack The Undertaker with the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps, but The Undertaker retaliated by avoiding the attack. Kane then performed a low blow on The Undertaker, who retaliated by delivering a Spear and ripping Kane's mask off, which resulted in Kane exiting the ring to the backstage area, ending the match with no winner.|$|E

40|$|Concrete-filled double-skin tubular (CFDST) {{column is}} one of the most {{efficient}} forms of column construction in which the steel tubes provides both axial strength and confining pressure to enhance the strength and ductility of the in-filled concrete. Compared with confined reinforced concrete columns, CFDST columns had stronger and more uniform confining pressure provided to the in-filled concrete by the steel tubes, which reduces the steel congestion problem for better concrete placing quality. However, a major shortcoming of the CFDST columns is the imperfect interface bonding that occurred at the elastic stage that reduces the elastic strength and stiffness of columns. To improve the situation, it is proposed in this study to use external <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> to restrict the dilation of outer steel tube of CFDST columns. For verification, a series of uni-axial compression test was performed on some CFDST columns with external <b>steel</b> <b>rings.</b> From the results, it was found that the elastic strength, elastic stiffness and ductility were enhanced by installing the <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> as external confinement. Lastly, a theoretical model for predicting the axial strength of confined CFDST columns has been developed...|$|R

25|$|Triple H {{defeated}} Stone Cold Steve Austin in an Anything Goes {{match for}} the WWF Championship. When Triple H attempted to use his sledgehammer against Austin, Vince McMahon grabbed it from him. They spent seven minutes of the match outside the ring, where Austin used a steel fence, trashcan, and microphone as weapons. Once in the ring, both men attempted to end the match by utilizing their finishing maneuvers. Back outside of the ring, Austin threw Triple H into both the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> stairs and the announce table, causing him to bleed profusely. Near {{the end of the}} match, The Rock, bandaged from his injuries earlier in the night, came down to ringside carrying the sledgehammer. Although he was aiming at Triple H, he accidentally hit Austin with the weapon. Taking advantage of the situation, Triple H Pedigreed The Rock and pinned Austin to retain his WWF Championship. After the match, Austin and Triple H continued to fight into the backstage area, where Chyna picked Triple H in a limousine and drove away.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Last Man Standing match between Shane McMahon and Kane. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Kane was forced to unmask himself after he had lost a Mask vs. Title match to Triple H. Shortly after Kane unmasked himself, Kane turned on and chokeslammed his tag team partner Rob Van Dam. Three weeks later on the July 14 episode of Raw, during an {{interview}} between Kane and Jim Ross, Kane set Jim Ross on fire after {{he thought he was}} mocking him. The following week on Raw, after a match between Kane and Van Dam ended in a no-contest, Linda McMahon came out to try and stop Kane from attacking Van Dam. Kane, however, gave Linda McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ramp. On the July 28 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon made a surprise appearance by attacking Kane for his actions the week before. The next week on Raw, Eric Bischoff defeated Shane McMahon after Kane interfered and gave McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps. On August 24 at SummerSlam, Kane defeated Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Shane McMahon defeated Eric Bischoff in a No Disqualification Falls Count Anywhere match. The following night on Raw, during a match between Shane McMahon and Chris Jericho, Kane interfered and performed a chokeslam on McMahon. Shortly afterwards, McMahon superkicked Kane into a dumpster that was on fire and full of gasoline. On the September 8 episode of Raw, Bischoff announced that McMahon and Kane would face each other in a Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven. The next week on Raw, after both men signed a contract for their match at Unforgiven, McMahon gave Kane multiple low blows, followed by a Leap of Faith through an announce table.|$|E

25|$|This was {{followed}} by the second tournament match pitting Chris Jericho and The Rock for the World Championship. The two exchanged many holds and reversals in the beginning. Jericho hit a spinning heel kick, and a missile dropkick. Jericho knocked The Rock's head into the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps, and hit a flying back elbow. The Rock came back with a flying clothesline. Jericho applied a sleeper hold but The Rock fought out of it. Jericho then hit a one-handed bulldog and a Lionsault. Jericho went to the top rope, but The Rock crotched him on the top. The Rock tried a Superplex but Jericho knocked him down, and hit a flying crossbody, but The Rock rolled through. Jericho continued attacking The Rock, but The Rock sent Jericho's head into the ringpost. Jericho fell to the outside where he dropped The Rock onto the barricade, and catapulted him into the ringpost. Jericho then tried to hit a Rock Bottom through the announce table, but The Rock reversed it into a People's DDT through the table. The Rock threw Jericho into the ring and set him for a Rock Bottom, but Jericho countered it into a Breakdown. He set The Rock up for the People's Elbow, but The Rock caught his legs, and applied a Sharpshooter on Jericho. Jericho reversed it into his own Sharpshooter, but The Rock got to the ropes to break the hold. Jericho then applied the Walls of Jericho, but The Rock countered it into a roll-up. The Rock hit a Rock Bottom, as Mr. McMahon came down to ringside. The Rock went for the pinfall but McMahon distracted the referee. The Rock hit McMahon, and hit a Spinebuster on Jericho. He brought McMahon into the ring and hit Jericho with a People's Elbow. The Rock attacked McMahon and, while the referee checked McMahon, Jericho hit a low blow and a Rock Bottom to win the match, and the title.|$|E
500|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Umaga. During the match, Cena {{attempted}} and failed to perform the FU various times. Cena would keep attacking Umaga by throwing Umaga's head into the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> post, which was followed up by a [...] Five Knuckle Shuffle. When Cena failed to execute a FU, Umaga would take control. Umaga charged at Cena, who was positioned in a corner, but Cena would put his feet up to superkick Umaga in the face. This move allowed Cena to quickly roll-up Umaga for the win. Cena had ended Umaga's undefeated streak and retained his WWE Championship.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's {{entrance}} was voodoo-themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena {{to be the}} monster that he is and to finish him off; Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, {{but it was not}} enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands", so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan (who had gotten on the ring apron) with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win.|$|E
