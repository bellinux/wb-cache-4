40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fiber}} reinforced plastic (FRP) bars to reinforce concrete structures necessitates the need for either developing a new design code or adopt the current one {{to account for the}} engineering characteristics of FRP materials. This paper suggests some modifications to the currently used ACI model for computing flexural strength, <b>service</b> <b>load</b> deflection, and the minimum reinforcement needed to avoid rupturing of the tensile reinforcement so as to use them when reinforcement is provided by Glass FRP (GFRP) bars. Two series of tests were carried out to check the validity of the suggested modifications. The first series was used to check the validity of the modifications made into the flexural and <b>service</b> <b>load</b> deflection models. The test results of the first series were also analyzed to develop two simple models for computing the <b>service</b> <b>load</b> deflection for beams reinforced with GFRP bars. The second series was used to check the accuracy of the modification suggested into minimum reinforcement model. Test results of the first series indicate that the flexural capacity of the beams reinforced by GFRP bars can be accurately predicted using the ultimate design theory. They also show that the current ACI model for computing the <b>service</b> <b>load</b> deflection underestimates the actual deflection of these beams. The two suggested models for <b>service</b> <b>load</b> deflection accurately estimated the measured deflection under <b>service</b> <b>load,</b> and the simplest of the two pertains better predictions than those of the models available in the literature. Test results of the second series reveal that there is an excellent agreement between the predicted and recorded behavior of the test specimens, which suggests the validity of the proposed model for calculating the required minimum reinforcement for beams reinforced by GFRP bars...|$|R
50|$|This is {{a service}} that large power users such as steel works, cold stores, large water pumping stations, can offer to the UK National Grid. These {{contractors}} have frequency sensitive relays fitted to the incoming breakers, and these disconnect the load if the system frequency falls beyond a pre-set figure (49.7 Hz). These loads are shed for a contracted period of at least 30 minutes. Within this period Standing Reserve (Reserve Service) diesels of similar capacity (i.e., around 660 MW total) start up, and enable the Frequency <b>Service</b> <b>loads</b> to be re-connected and the relays re-armed.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} main <b>service</b> <b>loads</b> {{used during the}} Second World War: The W Mark 1 (60 g AP at 747 m/s) and the W Mark 2 {{ammunition}} (47.6 g AP projectile at 884 m/s). The W Mark 1 could penetrate 23.2 mm of armour at 100 yards, about the thickness used on the frontal armour of a half-track or armoured car, or the side or rear armour of a light tank. Later in the conflict, a more effective round was developed, the W Mark 2, which fired a tungsten-cored projectile at 945 m/s. The Boys' effective range against unarmoured targets (for example, infantry), was much greater.|$|E

50|$|The {{laterally}} placed gallery (net weight 45 t) can be tilted upwards {{with the}} means of two electromechanical rope winches in about 5 min. The segmented hall floor (net weight 300 t) can be elevated {{by means of a}} spiral lift mechanism. An electric motor slides a steel strip continuously into a steel spiral to build up a vertical pedestal. In discharged condition the spiral and the rolled-up steel strip including the elevating structure take up the complete height of 50 cm and enable a total raise of the Hall-floor of about 5 m. The resulting room underneath the hall floor is used to store tables and chairs and can be accessed through a transport platform. With <b>service</b> <b>loads</b> of 500 kg/m2 at rest and 250 kg/m2 in motion the platforms can be moved with a speed between 2 and 8 cm/s.|$|E
50|$|The Class 31/4s, {{numbered}} from 31400 to 31469, were conversions of 31/1s {{to which}} ETH was fitted. They had an ETH index of 66, equivalent to 330 kW, which {{was sufficient to}} power trains of up to eleven Mk 3 carriages, {{in order to allow}} them to power long trains, whose service run would be worked by a larger locomotive, between depot and terminus, although in actual passenger <b>service</b> <b>loads</b> rarely exceeded four or five carriages. 330 kW accounted for {{about a third of the}} total electrical power output. The early conversions tapped off the main generator such that none of the ETH power was available for traction even if the ETH was not being used. The traction power output of some of the 31/4 subclass was therefore limited to a maximum of two-thirds of that of the non-ETH variants, this did not help the performance of an already somewhat underpowered locomotive, and late running of these 31/4-hauled services sometimes happened. Later conversions allowed unused ETH power to be used for traction.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{component}} of an [...] "intelligent" [...] aircraft structure {{is the ability}} to sense and diagnose potential threats to its structural integrity. This differs from conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) by the fact that Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [...] uses sensors that are permanently bonded or embedded in the structure. Composite materials, which are highly susceptible to hidden internal flaws which may occur during manufacturing and processing of the material or while the structure is subjected to <b>service</b> <b>loads,</b> require a substantial amount of inspection and defect monitoring at regular intervals. Thus, the increasing use of composite materials for aircraft primary structure aircraft components increases substantially their life cycle cost. According to some estimates, over 25% of the life cycle cost of an aircraft or aerospace structure, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production costs, can be attributed to operation and support, involving inspection and maintenance. With sensing technology reducing in cost, size and weight, and sensor signal processing power continuously increasing, a variety of approaches have been developed allowing integration of such sensing options onto or into structural components.|$|E
