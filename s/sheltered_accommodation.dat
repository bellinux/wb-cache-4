500|$|Additions and {{alterations}} to the streetscape {{have been}} minimal {{since the early}} 20th century. [...] Windlesham House became the New Sussex Hospital for Women in 1921 following alterations by Clayton & Black, who similarly rebuilt a 19th-century house on Montpelier Road as a chapel for Brighton's Christian Scientist community in the same year. The hospital was extended to the rear in the 1930s (but new flats called York Mansions were built on the site in 2001), and the Royal Alexandra Hospital absorbed a neighbouring villa. Additions to the Brighton & Hove High School, which had taken over The Temple, included a [...] "drab" [...] set of classrooms in the 1960s, a later administration block and a glazed sports hall in 2001–02 (the last two were designed by architects Morgan Carn Partnership).

50|$|Government {{protection}} for trafficking victims during the reporting period remained inadequate, and formal protocols {{to identify and}} care for trafficking victims were lacking.

As part of its ongoing program to assist organizations that shelter vulnerable populations, the government granted funding to some facilities that provided housing for trafficking victims, though not in a consistent or timely fashion. In 2007, the Department of Home Affairs referred one foreign child victim of trafficking to IOM for assistance. The Department of Social Development (DSD) provided the victim with <b>shelter</b> <b>accommodation,</b> schooling, and basic needs. However, DSD did not refer any children to IOM for assistance during the reporting period.

40|$|Objective: Explore the {{long-term}} course of schizophrenia and related disorders. Method: Naturalistic study of 225 patients initially treated with risperidone (monotherapy {{or in combination}} with other psychotropic drugs) over 5 years. Results: Stable symptomatology and side effects were observed. Clinician GAF scores were 55 - 61, but patients' self-ratings were higher. Clinician and patient CGI scores were at the same level. Annual in-patient days decreased but days in <b>sheltered</b> <b>accommodations</b> increased still more. Only 12 % of the patients studied or worked fulltime. One in four had no social contacts except with staff. Eight patients died during the 5 years. Conclusion: The findings underline the chronicity and seriousness of psychotic disorders in terms of social outcome and, indirectly, the low quality of life of this group of persons. Patients were generally well aware of their illness and able to sort out symptoms from drug side effects. This opens for more active involvement of patients in monitoring their own treatment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} process of shelter exits for {{homeless}} individuals and for different shelter types in the public shelter system {{in the city of}} Groningen in the Netherlands. Individualised administrative data from the Groningen Homelessness Monitor (2003 – 2006) are used for estimating a Weibull hazard rate regression model. Results show that the different shelter types fit adequately with their policy purposes : lengths of stay in emergency <b>shelter</b> <b>accommodation</b> appear to be shorter than in supportive housing accommodation and clients tend to remain longest in guest houses. The results also indicate that the use of day shelters, as well as demographic variables such as age, gender and nationality, are associated with a differentiated likelihood of continuing homelessness. The results of this study in the Dutch context are compared with research on {{the process of}} homelessness in the United States, and finally the implications of these findings and future directions for research on the process of homelessness are discussed. ...|$|R
