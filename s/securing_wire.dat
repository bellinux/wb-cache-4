Even if the diagnosis is suspected, angiography often conveys limited information about the underlying pathology, much of which is crucial for successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Due to the dissection flap and the resultant double lumen, SCAD poses unique challenges for PCI, specifically in <b>securing</b> <b>wire</b> access to the true lumen without propagation of the dissection. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a wire-based intravascular imaging modality with a high resolution of 10 - 20 µm. We present a case demonstrating the use of OCT in emergency PCI of SCAD, where OCT was integral {{not only to the}} {{diagnosis of}} SCAD, but also to successful PCI of the condition. It is a valuable aid to PCI in cases where there is uncertainty regarding the precise guidewire location, proving its use in the cardiac catheterization laboratory beyond that of merely a diagnostic tool...|$|E

As with the data center network segment, simplifying the campus network by eliminating the distribution layer improves performance even in very large networks, simplifies the network, and cuts capital and operating costs. Simplifying the network can reduce the number of discrete network elements that must be purchased, deployed, powered, cooled, and managed by up to 85 percent.|$|R

We also present a tool aimed at real-time detection of these attacks. The tool monitors network packets to detect local and distributed attacks within its radio range.

50|$|On the {{declaration}} of war, one of Britain's first acts was to cut all German undersea cables. On the night of 3 August 1914, the cable ship Alert located and cut Germany's five trans-Atlantic cables, which ran down the English Channel. Soon after, the six cables running between Britain and Germany were cut. This forced the Germans to use either a telegraph line that connected through the British network and could be tapped, or through radio which the British could then intercept. The destruction of more <b>secure</b> <b>wired</b> communications, to improve the intelligence take, has been a regular practice since then.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{have become an}} integral part of today’s networks. The ease of deployment, low cost, mobility and high data rates have contributed significantly to their popularity. The medium of data transmission in wireless networks makes them inherently less <b>secure</b> than <b>wired</b> networks. For wireless networks to access the Internet they must be connected to a wired network via an Access Point or a wireless router. This has led wireless network equipment manufacturers to implement wireless Access Points and wireless routers with a built in switch for wired clients and a WiFi access point for wireless clients. The set up within the equipment is such that the wired and wireless networks are internally bridged together such that they are in a single Local Area Network (LAN). This mix of wired and wireless networks poses a new class of attacks on wired networks via insecure wireless LANs. One such class of attack is the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Cache Poisoning attack. Depending on the wireless LAN set-up, previously <b>secure</b> <b>wired</b> networks may become vulnerable to attacks from wireless clients in the same LAN as the wired client. My project aims to develop a solution to prevent ARP Cache Poisoning attacks in a wireless Access Point-based network, involving wireless and wired clients. I have proposed a design to prevent ARP cache poisoning attacks and, as a proofof- concept, have implemented the design in a Wireless router manufactured by Linksys...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{networked}} control applications, {{confidentiality and}} integrity are important features to address {{in order to}} prevent against attacks. Moreover, network control systems are a fundamental part of the communication components of current cyber-physical systems (e. g., automotive communications). Many networked control systems employ Time-Triggered (TT) architectures that provide mechanisms enabling the exchange of precise and synchronous messages. TT systems have computation and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) to TT networked control systems. The contributions of the paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing automotive controller execution times. The methods and results of the paper can be used for evaluating the performance impact of security mechanisms and, thus, for the design of <b>secure</b> <b>wired</b> and wireless TT networked control systems...|$|R
