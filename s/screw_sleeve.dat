50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a <b>screw</b> <b>sleeve,</b> which extended {{to work a}} bell crank. The bell crank turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or aftward along its centreline.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{showed that}} Bailey {{was not the first}} to conceive the idea of a device for opening or closing rigidly an automatic valve. The same thing had been done by means of wedges and screws and other devices. He cannot therefore cover by his patent all the devices for producing this result, no matter what their form or mode of operation. The claim must be confined to the specific device described in the specification and claim—namely a pinhole and pin. If this construction of the claim be adopted, it is clear that no infringement is shown, for the appellees do not use a pinhole and pin for holding their valve open or closed, but a <b>screw,</b> <b>sleeve,</b> or cap, and therefore one of the elements of the combination, covered by the second claim of appellant's patent, is wanting in the device used by the appellees.|$|E
50|$|Fruit of {{the bells}} is <b>screwed</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{which is a}} lot of seeds. It opens on the side, thanks to the 3-5 hole and the top of the fruit remains closed. The seeds are about 1 mm in length and about 0.3 mm wide. Cylinder are light brown, bare surfaces.|$|R

50|$|The first screwpile {{lighthouse}} type {{built in}} the United States was at Brandywine Shoal, Delaware Bay, an area served by a lightship since 1823 and an ordinary straightpile lighthouse which stood briefly there in 1828 but was destroyed by ice. Major Hartman Bache, a distinguished engineer of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, began work in 1848 and completed the task in 1850, at a construction cost of $53,317. Alexander Mitchell served as consultant. The screwpiles were turned by a 4-foot capstan worked by 30 men. To protect the structure from ice floes an ice-breaker consisting of a pier of 30 iron screwpiles 23 feet long and five inches in diameter was screwed down into the bottom and interconnected at their heads above the water reinforcing them together. Subsequently, though, the use of caisson lighthouses proved more durable in locations subject to ice.Screwpile lighthouses were relatively inexpensive, easy to construct, and comparatively quick to build. They became especially popular after the Civil War when the Lighthouse Board adopted a policy to replace inside (bays, sounds, and rivers) light vessels with screwpile lighthouses. Most screwpile lighthouses were made with iron piles, though a few were made with wooden piles covered with metal <b>screw</b> <b>sleeves</b> (these sleeves were probably adopted because they were less expensive and easier to insert into the bottom, plus the sleeve protected the wood from marine-boring invertebrates). The typical screwpile lighthouse was hexagonal or octagonal in plan consisting of a central pile which was set first and then the six or eight perimeter piles were screwed in place around it.|$|R

The bar is mounted on top of the guitar body usually by means of sturdy {{threaded}} metal studs <b>screwed</b> into threaded <b>sleeves</b> embedded into the body of the guitar. The studs and stopbar are located behind the separate bridge piece.|$|R
40|$|How {{the fitting}} {{clearance}} between the <b>screw</b> and the <b>sleeve</b> of a labyrinth screw pump (LSP) affects the pump performance and what law it follows are still unsolved problems for LSP design. So the fluid quasi-steady {{flow in the}} pump with different clearances is approximately modeled by the shear-stress transport k-ω model (SST k-ω model) in multiple reference frame (MRF) of CFD. The pump characteristics experiments are also carried out. In analyzing the simulated results, the fluid velocity in the pump is simplified as a linear superposition of a Couette flow dragged by the rotor screw and a pressure flow driven by the differential pressure of LSP. The CFD simulated results reveal that the clearance has scarcely effect on the drag flow. The mean axial pressure flow velocity in the clearance is the maximum and it increases with an increase of clearance. The leakage mainly occurs between the lands of <b>screw</b> and <b>sleeve,</b> and its rate can be simply estimated by leakage formulation for a narrow slot. With an increase in clearance, the pump maximum capacity changes little but the head and efficiency obviously decrease at the same flow rate. The changing tendency of simulated performances of the pump is in good agreement with the experimental results. At last, a set of modified relations between the pump performances and the relative diametrical clearance has been given, which {{can be applied to}} conveniently convert the LSP performance when the clearance changes...|$|R

The screws have a greater length than the threaded sleeves or holes in order to be able to effect the removal of a hood (1) from a support (2) by using the support as a prop.

5000|$|The Mark 4s were Nos. 22 - 32, 38 - 50, and 52 - 83. The {{original}} Mark 4 Mod 0 {{guns were}} identical to Mark 3 Mod 1 guns with the trunnion hoop and elevating band removed {{and with the}} threads formerly under the trunnion hoop being continued {{to the rear of}} the gun. This allowed these guns to be <b>screwed</b> into the <b>sleeve</b> of a two-gun turret mount. Mark 4 Mod 1 was one Mark 4 gun, No. 27, shortened by [...] in rear of the threads. Mods 2 through 9 were for minor differences primarily for testing different mounting techniques. Mod 10 was for one gun cut down to 23 calibers and used for experimental work with high-explosive shells. Mod 11 was a Mod 4 gun, No. 72, with an alloy steel liner, uniformed rifling and modified chamber.|$|R
40|$|For {{my senior}} design project, I {{designed}} and built a device that will dilate the human esophagus for patients suffering {{from a variety of}} medical conditions. One current technique, Mercury bougienage, uses a tapered rubber rod filled with Mercury. The Mercury falls because of gravity, inducing an outward pressure on the esophagus. Two main problems with this procedure are the large longitudinal forces involved and the dependence upon the "feel" of the physician in applying the force. As a result, there is 'an uncertain risk of tissue perforation under this treatment. Other procedures have met with limited success and are difficult to apply to narrow or tortuous strictures. My design, developed with Carr Everbach, involves the use of a three-dimensional braid that expands radially when compressed and becomes narrow when stretched. Using a screw with left and right-handed threads, two sleeves were constructed so that they could slide up and down the <b>screw.</b> The <b>sleeves</b> are attached to each end of the braid. To test the device, an apparatus was built that applies an internal pressure to a latex tube, causing it to expand. The expansion was measured with a column of water and the pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer. Preliminary mechanical tests indicate that the device will exert forces necessary for esophageal dilation. Testing of the braid shows that the radial force varies linearly with the diameter of the braid. If the radial force is monitored by a control system, the device should allow for greater sensitivity of forces applied, resulting in more effective dilation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{turning and}} {{grinding}} the long axis with cone thin-walled, they are clamped to be deformation easily and positioned difficultly. Based {{on the existing}} theory of clamping with the conical sleeve, we design {{a new type of}} fixture in this paper. The outer cone of the fixture cling to the inner cone of the workpiece, it is sealed hermetically at the both ends. The head of the sleeve stretch out of a cylindrical boss, we can use the three-jaw chuck to position it on the machine tool. Also we use the steady rest to fix the end of the sleeve. The steady rest connect with the shell of a rotary joint. The end of the rotary joint <b>screw</b> with the <b>sleeve,</b> the other end of it is connected with a getter pump. It formatted a vacuum between the sleeve and the workpiece by the use of holes around the circumference of the sleeve. The utility model to the fixture used for thin wall conical parts with long shaft...|$|R
