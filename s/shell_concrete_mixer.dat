50|$|A <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> (often mistakenly {{called a}} cement mixer) is {{a device that}} {{homogeneously}} combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel, and water to form concrete. A typical <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works portable <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers</b> are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} achieve the {{application}} requirements of a mobile asphalt <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer,</b> a distributed computer control system of the mixer is developed with an industrial control computer and a S 7 - 200 PLC. Through analyzing the operation principle of mixer, main functions and specifications of the system are proposed. In this paper, the hardware constitution and the software design method of the system are introduced in detail, and the working process of the asphalt <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> can be controlled automatically and intelligently in real time. Moreover, the functions of batching control, process monitoring and data management has been realized. Test {{results show that the}} asphalt <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> works stably and reliability...|$|R

50|$|A mobile <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer,</b> or mobile <b>concrete</b> {{dispenser}} as it {{is sometimes}} also called, is an on-demand concrete production solution. A mobile <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> is a batch plant mounted on a chassis-usually a truck or trailer-and carries unmixed material (sand, cement, coarse aggregates, water and any other materials or chemicals needed for more specialty applications) to a job site and mixed on a continuous or intermittent basis as required for fresh maximum strength concrete.|$|R

50|$|The {{head office}} {{is located in}} Memmingen. In 1945, the company Stetter, which {{specialized}} in <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers,</b> was developed from a former forge. The first transport <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> on a Magirus-Deutz truck chassis {{was presented at the}} Hanover Fair in 1958. Through developments such as integrated hydraulic drive, direct drive, special drum shape, design of spirals in the outlet area and integrated oil cooler and filter systems, Stetter GmbH secured an important status in the industry. Already {{at the end of the}} sixties, they were the market leader in the branch and more than 50,000 transport mixers were sold between 1958 to 1994. The <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers</b> are built on the chassis of over 15 different vehicle manufacturers in up to 300 different designs. Adaptation to country-specific guidelines and working methods make this diversity necessary.|$|R
