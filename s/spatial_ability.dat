However, {{research on this}} topic has not focused on possible differences in the spatial demands of different scientific fields. Furthermore, there is a partial dissociation between <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> involved {{in dealing with the}} space of environments (large-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities)</b> and those involved in dealing with the space of objects (small-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities).</b> We used on-line self-report measures to collect preliminary data on the <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> of scientists in different fields, as well as humanists and individuals in professional fields. Geoscientists had the highest self-report ratings of both environmental and small-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities,</b> whereas geographers had relatively high self ratings of environmental <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> and engineers had relatively high self ratings of small-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities.</b> Other scientific disciplines did not differ from the mean in self reported <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities.</b> Self ratings of verbal ability were un{{correlated with}} self ratings of <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> and, as expected, were highest for humanities specialists...|$|R

Much of the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>ability</b> may be {{responsible}} in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10-20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban {{high school in the}} Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation. Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{rationale}} for {{the study was to}} empirically test a conceptual model that identifies the relationship between wayfinding, <b>spatial,</b> and scholastic <b>abilities.</b> Wayfinding and <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> were assessed in 120 University of Arizona introductory psychology students ranging in age from 17 to 36 years. Participants completed a lengthy test battery of wayfinding and <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> tasks. Tasks included the computer-generated arena task, the computer-generated maze task, a Background Information Questionnaire, the Taxi Cab Task, the performance subtests from the WAIS-III, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Object Relations Task. A structural equations model showed that <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> predict wayfinding ability (β =. 68, p <. 05) and that scholastic aptitude predicts <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> (β =. 45, p <. 05), but not wayfinding ability (β = -. 27, ns). The data more than adequately fit the theory-driven conceptual model (CFI =. 971; χ² = 36. 794; p < 30). In addition, several first-order factors of <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> proved reliable and highly correlated to their indicators (i. e., the WAIS-III performance subtests). Findings from this study suggest that a theory-driven conceptual model provides useful predictive information about the relationship between wayfinding and <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> factors. Moreover, the evidence supports, and hopefully inspires, advocacy for an interdisciplinary approach to studying the relationship between wayfinding and conceptually related cognitive processes...|$|R

A group of 450 people from 20 to 91 years oldwas asked to point in the direction of cardinal points and to complete a set of spatial tasks, spatial questionnaires andWMmeasures. Results showed that, while <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> and positive self-assessments mediated the influence of age on the ability to identify cardinal points,WMaccounted for the age-related variance in <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> and positive self-assessments.

[...] The children were split into two groups, with the experimental group playing Marble Madness, while the control group played Conjecture. [...] The distinction is important because Marble Madness requires spatial skills while Conjecture does not. [...] The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population. [...] The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days. [...] Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for <b>spatial</b> <b>ability,</b> on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing Marble Madness significantly increased <b>spatial</b> <b>ability,</b> especially in the children who had low performance on the <b>spatial</b> <b>ability</b> pre-test. [...] Conversely, playing Conjecture did not increase children's spatial skills. [...] This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present. [...] It is unknown if these increases in <b>spatial</b> <b>ability</b> persist into the long-term.

40|$|Algebra {{has been}} called a {{gatekeeper}} because proficiency in algebra allows access to educational and economic opportunities. Many students struggle with algebra because it is cognitively demanding. There is little empirical evidence concerning which cognitive factors influence algebra achievement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a cognitive model of algebra achievement among undergraduate college students. Algebra achievement was defined as the ability to manipulate algebraic expressions which is a substantial part of many algebra curriculums. The model included cognitive factors that past research has shown relate to overall math achievement. Other goals were to compare a cognitive model of algebra achievement with a model of SAT-M performance and to test for gender differences in the model of algebra achievement. Structural equation modeling was used to test the direct and indirect effects of algebra experience, working memory, 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities,</b> and computational fluency on algebra achievement. Algebra experience had the strongest direct effect on algebra achievement. Combined direct and indirect effects of computational fluency were as strong as the direct effect of algebra experience. While 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> had a direct effect on algebra achievement, working memory did not. Working memory did have a direct effect on computational fluency and 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities.</b> The total effects of 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> and working memory on algebra achievement were moderate. There were differences in the cognitive models of algebra achievement and SAT-M. SAT-M scores were highly related to 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities,</b> but moderately related to algebra experience. There were also gender differences in the cognitive model of algebra achievement. Working memory was highly related to computational fluency for males, but was not related to computational fluency for females. 	This study adds to the large body of evidence that working memory plays a role in computational abilities throughout development. The evidence that working memory affects higher level math achievement indirectly through computational fluency and 3 D <b>spatial</b> <b>abilities</b> provides clarity to conflicting results in the few studies that have examined the role of working memory in higher level math achievement...|$|R
