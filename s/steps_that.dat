40|$|Lixian Han Hongjun Zhu Jianwen Su University of California at Santa Barbara ABSTRACT Evaluation of {{a spatial}} join {{typically}} has two steps: a filter <b>step</b> <b>that</b> applies the join on approximations of spatial objects and a refinement <b>step</b> <b>that</b> determines the actual intersection of two spatial objects. In this paper, we study the e#ectiveness of filters with di#erent approximations including minimum bounding rectangles, rectilinear approximations, minimum 5 -corner bounding convex polygons, and convex hulls. We compare the e#ectiveness of filters {{by comparing the}} number of "false hits" in the filter result using these approximations. We analyze the impact of parameters such as aspect ratios of input polygons and approximation quality on the filter e#ectiveness. 1. INTRODUCTION The conventional approach to evaluate a spatial join uses two steps: (1) a filter <b>step</b> <b>that</b> checks intersections of approximations of spatial objects; and (2) a refinement <b>step</b> <b>that</b> check intersection of objects [...] ...|$|R

This {{is motivated by}} the default processing model of the SPEs SECRET was designed to capture, which typically consists of a predefined, fixed structure with three steps [10]: (1) a stream-to-relation <b>step</b> <b>that</b> uses windows to select portions of the input stream; (2) a relation-to-relation <b>step</b> <b>that</b> performs the actual processing by only considering the content of windows; (3) a relation-to-stream <b>step</b> <b>that</b> converts back {{the results of the}} computation into stream elements. This fixed structure well serves the purpose of performing continuous queries on streaming data, but it is not flexible enough for general purpose computations.|$|R

5|$|Harlech Castle rests {{upon the}} spur of rock called the Harlech Dome; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the {{remaining}} approaches to the castle. The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 <b>steps</b> <b>that</b> runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs.|$|E

Forts 5 and 6 occupy the upper slopes of the mountain and offer panoramic views of Lake Songkhla and the Gulf of Thailand. The two pagodas on the summit of Khao Daeng were built on the base of fort 10 during the 1830s to commemorate the suppression of rebellions in Kedah.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than the <b>steps</b> <b>that</b> cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to}} be caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their hands clasped in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard, one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered recumbent effigies. The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. The churchyard also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal <b>steps</b> <b>that</b> were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. The churchyard contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E
