For instance, the live tile for an email client may display the number of unread emails. The Start screen allows users to uninstall their programs by right-clicking on them and selecting [...] "Uninstall". Pinned apps can be placed in groups.

40|$|SCOPE is an {{ensemble}} motif finder that uses three component algorithms in parallel to identify potential regulatory motifs by over-representation and motif position preference 1. Each component algorithm is optimized {{to find a}} different kind of motif. By taking the best of these three approaches, SCOPE performs better than any single algorithm, even in the presence of noisy data 1. In this article, we utilize a web version of SCOPE 2 to examine genes that are involved in telomere maintenance. SCOPE has been incorporated into at least two other motif finding programs 3, 4 and has been used in other studies 5 - 8. The three algorithms that comprise SCOPE are BEAM 9, which finds non-degenerate motifs (ACCGGT), PRISM 10, which finds degenerate motifs (ASCGWT), and SPACER 11, which finds longer bipartite motifs (ACCnnnnnnnnGGT). These three algorithms have been optimized to find their corresponding type of motif. Together, they allow SCOPE to perform extremely well. Once a gene set has been analyzed and candidate motifs identified, SCOPE can look for other genes that contain the motif which, when added to the original set, will improve the motif score. This can occur through over-representation or motif position preference. Working with partial gene sets that have biologically verified transcription factor binding sites, SCOPE was able to identify {{most of the rest of}} the genes also regulated by the given transcription factor. Output from SCOPE shows candidate motifs, their significance, and other information both as a table and as a graphical motif map. FAQs and video tutorials are available at the SCOPE web site which also includes a "Sample <b>Search</b> " <b>button</b> that allows the user to perform a trial run...|$|R

40|$|In {{interface}} development, it {{is crucial}} to reflect the users' expectations and mental models. By meeting users' expectations, errors can be prevented and the efficiency of the interaction can be enhanced. Applying these guidelines to website development reveals the need to know where users expect to find the most common web objects like the <b>search</b> field, home <b>button</b> or the navigation. In a preliminary online study with 136 participants, the most common web objects were identified for three web page types: online shops, news portals, and company web pages. These objects were used for the main study, which was conducted with 516 participants. In an online application, prototypical websites had to be constructed by the participants. Data analysis showed that Internet users have distinct mental models for different web page types (online shop, news portal, and company web page). Users generally agree about the locations of many, but not all, web objects. These mental models are robust to demographic factors like gender and web expertise. This knowledge could be used to improve the perception and usability of website...|$|R

The current study findings are compared with results from previous multimedia Web searching studies. The key findings are: (a) Since 1997, image search consistently is the dominant media type searched followed by audio and video; (b) multimedia search duration is still short (> 50 % of searching episodes are < 1 min), using few search terms; (c) many multimedia searches are for information about people, especially in audio search; and (d) multimedia search has begun to shift from entertainment to other categories such as medical, sports, and technology (based on the most repeated terms).

In routine development process it becomes very time consuming to do the repeated task of coding for same events. There are certain vendor specific tools like Oracle Application Express (OAE) from ORACLE and some similar tools from IBM mainframe to design the product and do analysis and reporting but these tools are too much vendor specific and strictly need the proprietary DB to develop the project. For instant, OAE needs strictly ORACLE as a backend for its development. Our tool-“Rapid Project Builder ” (RPB) is used to avoid time consumed for coding the same business logic repeatedly. The tool will also performAutomatic Code Generation (ACG) in specific language of developer‟s requirement. The developer can design the application‟s frontend GUI using RBP with DND along with the specification of form and fields. After adding control like add, delete, <b>search</b> or modify <b>buttons</b> to the application, RPB adds the BL automatically to these controls along with complete language specific code.
