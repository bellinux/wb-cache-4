5|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident {{was caused by a}} <b>stress-related</b> panic attack, while medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities. In none of these hospitalizations, including this one, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from <b>stress-related</b> illnesses and severe weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable <b>stress-related</b> condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick {{returned}} to Test cricket in May, scoring 106 against Sri Lanka {{to become the}} first Test centurion of the 2006 English season. The century proved to be the high point of Trescothick's Test summer, however, as he reached a half-century just once in the subsequent six Tests against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. This run of form was lifted later in the year by two ODI centuries, one apiece against Ireland and Sri Lanka. In September, he withdrew from the remaining ODIs against Pakistan and asked not to be considered for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy squad because of a <b>stress-related</b> illness. It was later believed likely that Trescothick had been suffering from clinical depression, which was also the cause of much of his trouble throughout 2006.|$|E
5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were <b>stress-related</b> sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick was an {{automatic}} choice for England between 2000 and 2006, before a <b>stress-related</b> illness threatened {{his career and}} forced him {{to pull out of}} the national squad. He began the process of rebuilding his career with Somerset in 2007, and scored two double-centuries that season. However, he continued to remain uneasy about returning to international cricket, and announced his retirement from internationals in March 2008, opting to continue playing at county level for Somerset. Since then, media speculation has continued as to a possible international return – however, Trescothick has repeatedly voiced his intent to remain in retirement, and has suffered recurrences of his condition in both 2008 and 2009 when Somerset toured abroad. He nevertheless continues to play for Somerset, having signed a contract extension until the end of the 2018 season, also working as a commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the off-season.|$|E
25|$|On 25 November 2013, Jonathan Trott {{pulled out}} of the {{remainder}} of the tour citing a <b>stress-related</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|Prior stress {{exposure}} heightens fear learning during Pavlovian fear conditioning. <b>Stress-related</b> {{increases in}} ghrelin circulation {{were shown to}} be necessary and sufficient for stress to increase fear learning. Ghrelin {{was found to be}} upregulated by stress {{even in the absence of}} adrenal hormones. Blocking the ghrelin receptor during stress abolished <b>stress-related</b> enhancement of fear memory without blunting other markers of stress. These results suggest that ghrelin is a novel branch of the stress response. Human studies are needed to translate the use of anti-ghrelin treatments to prevent stress-induced psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|Pickett and Wilkinson {{argue that}} {{inequality}} and social stratification {{lead to higher}} levels of psychosocial stress and status anxiety which can lead to depression, chemical dependency, less community life, parenting problems and <b>stress-related</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also known}} that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin {{diseases}} and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to <b>stress-related</b> skin diseases and skin tumors.|$|E
25|$|Hypnotherapy is {{undertaken}} while a subject is {{in a state}} of hypnosis. Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including: dysfunctional habits, anxiety, <b>stress-related</b> illness, pain management, and personal development.|$|E
25|$|The {{stress of}} the war and {{especially}} this bitter internal battle within Labor took a great toll on Curtin's health, which had never been robust even at the best of times. He had suffered all of his life from <b>stress-related</b> illnesses, and depression; he was also a heavy smoker.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 2009, Beasley {{reportedly}} {{checked into}} a Houston rehab center, just days after he posted pictures of himself on his Twitter page with what some have speculated to be marijuana in the background. It is unknown if the rehab was drug related; officially he was receiving counseling for <b>stress-related</b> issues.|$|E
25|$|On 15 November 2006, Joyce was {{selected}} by England's chairman of selectors, David Graveney, {{to be in the}} Test squad for the 2006/2007 Ashes series, in place of Marcus Trescothick, who withdrew, suffering from a <b>stress-related</b> illness. This was a somewhat controversial decision as he was given preference over the more experienced Owais Shah and Robert Key.|$|E
25|$|Solids, liquids, and gases have stress fields. Static fluids support {{normal stress}} but will flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with ductile {{materials}} failing under shear and brittle materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in <b>stress-related</b> properties, and non-Newtonian materials have rate-dependent variations.|$|E
25|$|Qinetiq {{is one of}} the top ten largest UK {{employers}} {{of science}} and engineering graduates, recruiting around 150 a year. Between 2002 and 2006, it has appeared in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers list. It has since been accused by unions of exhibiting higher than average levels of <b>stress-related</b> depression among employees, which is strongly denied by the company.|$|E
25|$|Curcumin {{has been}} shown to impart neuroprotection against Japanese Encephalitis {{infection}} in an in vitro study. Curcumin possibly acts by decreasing cellular reactive oxygen species level, restoration of cellular membrane integrity, decreasing pro-apoptotic signaling molecules, and modulating cellular levels of <b>stress-related</b> proteins. It has also been shown that the production of infective viral particles from previously infected neuroblastoma cells are reduced, which is achieved by the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} looked at the {{bereaved}} in terms of increased risks for <b>stress-related</b> illnesses. Colin Murray Parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth {{in the first six months}} following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent.|$|E
25|$|Other factors outside {{culture that}} {{demonstrate}} differences in domestic violence prevalence and gender disparities in India include socioeconomic class, educational level, and family structure beyond the patriarchal framework. A 1999 study {{published by the}} American Journal of Epidemiology identified so-called “stress factors” that are critical to understanding varying rates of domestic violence in other scopes outside of region-specific factors. These <b>stress-related</b> factors within the household include low educational attainment, poverty, young initial age of marriage, having multiple children, and other limiting engendered development factors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{meta-analysis}} by Zorrilla et al. in 2001, they replicated Herbert and Cohen's meta-analysis. Using {{the same study}} selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating neutrophils, decreases in number and percentages of total T cells and helper T cells, and decreases in percentages of Natural killer cell (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen's finding of <b>stress-related</b> decreases in NKCC and T cell mitogen proliferation to Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Concanavalin A (Con A).|$|E
25|$|Propranolol {{is being}} {{investigated}} as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. Individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer <b>stress-related</b> symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due {{to the fact that}} memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system {{appears to}} play a {{significant}} role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of <b>stress-related</b> behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons. Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} DID is unknown and widely debated, with debate {{occurring}} between supporters of different hypotheses: that DID is {{a reaction to}} trauma; that DID is produced by inappropriate psychotherapeutic techniques that cause a patient to enact {{the role of a}} patient with DID; and newer hypotheses involving memory processing that allows for the possibility that trauma-causing dissociation can occur after childhood in DID, as it does in PTSD. It has been suggested that all the trauma-based and <b>stress-related</b> disorders be placed in one category that would include both DID and PTSD. Disturbed and altered sleep has also been suggested as having a role in dissociative disorders in general and specifically in DID, alterations in environments also largely affecting the DID patient.|$|E
25|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an {{integration}} point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is activated by various environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. The activation requires its phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), or its autophosphorylation triggered by the interaction of MAP3K7IP1/TAB1 protein with this kinase. The substrates of this kinase include transcription regulator ATF2, MEF2C, and MAX, cell cycle regulator CDC25B, and tumor suppressor p53, which suggest the roles of this kinase in <b>stress-related</b> transcription and cell cycle regulation, as well as in genotoxic stress response. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{two seasons}} after the Maple Leafs' Stanley Cup victories, the team saw several player departures, {{including}} Bathgate, and Brewer, {{as well as}} several new additions, including Marcel Pronovost, and Terry Sawchuk. During the 1966–67, the team had lost 10 games in a row, sending Imlach to the hospital with a <b>stress-related</b> illness. However, from the time King Clancy took over as the head coach, to Imlach's return, the club was on a 10-game undefeated streak, building momentum before the playoffs. The Leafs made their last Cup finals in 1967. Playing against Montreal, the heavy favourite for the year, the Leafs managed to win, with Bob Pulford scoring the double-overtime winner in game three; Jim Pappin scored the series winner in Game 6. Keon was named the playoff's most valuable player, and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E
25|$|The fast-paced and {{unpredictable}} nature {{of health care}} places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among {{the highest levels of}} occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, shift work, and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, <b>stress-related</b> illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing compassion fatigue and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.|$|E
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a <b>stress-related</b> fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the First World War brought a time of {{hardship}} for Burnet's practice, and during this period a disagreement resulted in Tait leaving the practice to work in America. After the war, the London office began to receive commissions once more, including work on completing the Selfridges department store on Oxford Street. The Imperial War Graves Commission also commissioned war memorials from Burnet's firm in Gallipoli, Palestine and Suez (1919). Burnet took {{a leading role in}} the design of the memorials and in the work on Adelaide House, London Bridge. His health was deteriorating, however; <b>stress-related</b> eczema, brought on by wartime hardship, professional disagreements and financial scandals in the Glasgow office, made it hard for him to work. Thomas Tait had returned to the practice after a reconciliation, and he began to take {{a leading role in the}} practice, working on the Daily Telegraph Building and Lloyds Bank on Cornhill. Burnet himself dealt with the redesign on Lomax Simpson's Unilever House project, but otherwise acted as a consultant and went into semi-retirement.|$|E
25|$|Doubts about Muralitharan's action persisted, however. On the 1998–99 tour to Australia he {{was once}} again called for {{throwing}} by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga, was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. It later emerged {{that at the time}} of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a <b>stress-related</b> illness and he stood down for the rest of the series. Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. At no stage was Muralitharan requested to change or remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner. He had not yet mastered the doosra.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} as runners-up in the ICC Champions Trophy, England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A 3–0 home win secured England the urn for {{the fourth}} time in five series. However, in the return series, they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5–0 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a <b>stress-related</b> illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Andy Flower resigned his post whilst batsman Kevin Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team. Flower was replaced by his predecessor Peter Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the 2015 World Cup. He was replaced by Australian Trevor Bayliss who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against New Zealand and Pakistan. In the Test arena, England reclaimed the Ashes 3–2 in the summer of 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{other side}} of Christmas, England went to India in March and after Trescothick absented himself owing to <b>stress-related</b> illness, Strauss found himself opening England's batting with 21-year-old debutante Alastair Cook. Cook {{repeated}} Strauss' debut theatrics, scoring a half and full century, overshadowing Strauss's 28 and 46 in the drawn match. Without Cook opposite him in the third Test, Strauss shone once again with 128 in a winning effort to level the series. In the following One Day matches England would have been lucky to manage a draw, suffering four straight losses under replacement captain Andrew Flintoff since Vaughan's knee-injury had prevented him from touring. Strauss's only double digit score was 61 in the second match but with Flintoff requiring a break from deputising, Strauss was handed the captaincy for the fifth match which ultimately was abandoned, leading to crowd violence in Guwahati. With Flintoff remaining the twelfth man for the following ODI, Strauss guided England to victory after putting India to bat, with a hundred partnership with Ian Bell totalling 74 before cramp forced him to retire. The emphatic, eight over victory was to be England's only One Day success on the tour as the final match saw India chase the runs victoriously with only five balls remaining with Strauss offering only 25.|$|E

500|$|Returning {{once again}} to the {{international}} arena, Trescothick {{was included in the}} squad for the 2006–07 Ashes in Australia, and played in the first two tour matches against the Prime Minister's XI and New South Wales. On 14 November, following the match against New South Wales, England announced Trescothick was flying home due to a [...] "recurrence of a <b>stress-related</b> illness". Geoffrey Boycott later stated that depression amongst cricketers is rarely documented, but with the current congested ICC schedule, player [...] "burnout" [...] and similar illnesses were becoming more commonplace.|$|E
500|$|In 1853, Sherman {{resigned}} his captaincy {{and became}} {{manager of the}} San Francisco branch of the St. Louis-based bank, Lucas, Turner & Co. He returned to San Francisco {{at a time of}} great turmoil in the West. He survived two shipwrecks and floated through the Golden Gate on the overturned hull of a foundering lumber schooner. Sherman suffered from <b>stress-related</b> asthma because of the city's aggressive business culture. Late in life, regarding his time in a San Francisco experiencing a frenzy of real estate speculation, Sherman recalled: [...] "I can handle a hundred thousand men in battle, and take the City of the Sun, but am afraid to manage a lot in the swamp of San Francisco." [...] In 1856, during the vigilante period, he served briefly as a major general of the California militia.|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused <b>stress-related</b> dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a <b>stress-related</b> panic attack. In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front {{as well as the}} rights to more songs. [...] "Earth Song" [...] was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995; it sold a million copies, making it Jackson's most successful single in the UK. The track [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] became controversial when the Anti-Defamation League and other groups criticized its allegedly antisemitic lyrics. Jackson quickly released a revised version of the song without the offending lyrics. In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form for [...] "Scream" [...] and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.|$|E
500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of <b>stress-related</b> illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then a lot of us will be screaming favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him".|$|E
