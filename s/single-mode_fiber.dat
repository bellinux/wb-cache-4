It is pointed out that <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> represent potentially a superior medium for the distribution of frequency and timing reference signals and wideband (400 MHz) IF signals. In this connection, <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> have the potential to improve the capability and precision of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). Attention is given to problems related to precise time synchronization throughout the DSN, questions regarding the selection of a transmission medium, and the function of the distribution systems, taking into account specific improvements possible by an employment of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

25|$|In simpler terms, {{there is}} a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber {{so that it will}} propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The sine of this maximum angle is the {{numerical}} aperture (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. <b>Single-mode</b> <b>fiber</b> has a small NA.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fiber</b> has a core {{diameter}} of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fiber</b> for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see {{all the way to the}} bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E
40|$|Wavefront {{cleaning}} by <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> {{has proved}} to be efficient in optical-infrared interferometry to improve calibration quality. For instance, the FLUOR instrument has demonstrated the capability of fluoride glass <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> in this respect in the K and L bands. New interferometric instruments developped for the mid-infrared require the same capability for the 8 - 12 um range. We have initiated a program to develop <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> in the prospect of the VLTI mid-infrared instrument MIDI and of the ESA/DARWIN and NASA/TPF missions that require excellent wavefront quality. In order to characterize the performances of chalcogenide fibers we are developping, we have set up an experiment to measure the far-field pattern radiated at 10 um. In this paper, we report the first and promising results obtained with this new component. Comment: Conference "Interferometry for Optical Astronomy II", SPIE 200...|$|R

40|$|In-line {{fiber optic}} interferometers have {{attracted}} intensive attention for their potential sensing applications in refractive index, temperature, pressure and strain measurement, etc. Typical in-line fiber-optic interferometers are of two types: Fabry-Perot interferometers and core-cladding-mode interferometers. It’s {{known that the}} in-line fiber optic interferometers based on <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> can exhibit compact structures, easy fabrication and low cost. In this paper, we review two kinds of typical in-line fiber optic interferometers formed in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> fabricated with different post-processing techniques.

25|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, {{which uses a}} microscope objective lens to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into <b>single-mode</b> <b>fiber,</b> the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For <b>single-mode</b> <b>fiber,</b> fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an {{inverted}} taper-based technique for highly efficient coupling between SOI waveguides and standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibers</b> is re-ported. The coupling structure is polarization insen-sitive {{and it is}} based on the inverted taper coupled to a fiber-adapted waveguide. In this case, the fiber-adapted waveguide is made by using the SiOB 2 B layer under the Si waveguiding layer of the SOI wafer thus avoiding the use of extra materials such as polymers. The proposed coupling structure is aimed for being integrated with V-groove auto-alignment techniques.
