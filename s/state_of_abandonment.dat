2500|$|The {{theme of}} orgasm survived during Romanticism and is {{incorporated}} in many homoerotic works. In FRAGMENT: Supposed to be an Epithalamium of Francis Ravaillac and Charlotte Cordé, Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), [...] "a translator of extraordinary range and versatility", wrote the phrase [...] "No life can equal such a death." [...] That phrase {{has been seen as}} a metaphor for orgasm, and it was preceded by the rhythmic urgency of the previous lines [...] "Suck on, suck on, I glow, I glow!", which has been seen as alluding to fellatio. For Shelley, orgasm was [...] "the almost involuntary consequences of a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> in the society of a person of surpassing attractions". Edward Ellerker Williams, the last love of Shelley's life, was remembered by the poet in [...] "The Boat on the Serchio", which has been considered as possibly [...] "the grandest portrayal of orgasm in literature": ...|$|E

50|$|In October 1965, Hugo Consuegra wrote {{a courageous}} {{defense of the}} National Art Schools, and their architects, that was {{published}} in the journal Arquitectura Cuba. This article was the last attempt of this period to reconcile the schools with the values of the Cuban Revolution. Consuegra described the formal complexities, spatial ambiguities, and disjunctive qualities of the schools not as in contradiction with but as characteristic and positive values of the Cuban Revolution. However, Consuegra’s courageous defense proved to be in vain, and as the schools fell out of institutional favor, they were slowly abandoned. The Schools of Modern Dance and Plastic Arts continued to be used, though with little regard for their maintenance, and the Schools of Dramatic Arts, Music, and Ballet were allowed to fall into various <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and decay. The School of Ballet, nestled in a shady ravine, became completely engulfed in tropical jungle overgrowth. Ricardo Porro and later Vittorio Garatti were compelled to leave the country.|$|R

Plans to demolish the building alarm a group of activists who fear that a heroic chapter of history following the war will be erased from the memory of future generations.

40|$|Environmental and {{socio-economic}} {{changes are}} leading to increased levels <b>of</b> land <b>abandonment</b> worldwide. The assembly of plant communities on old fields has informed much ecological theory, {{which in turn}} has facilitated efforts at ecological restoration. The interaction of the cultivation legacy with inherent soil and vegetation characteristics will determine the dynamics of plant community assembly on old fields and indicate the level of effort required to restore historical vegetation <b>states.</b> The <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> traditional agricultural lands in some areas will create old fields that require limited or no restoration. Yet intensification of agriculture and rapid environmental change will lead to increasing numbers of old fields that show little recovery towards an historic vegetation <b>state.</b> The restoration <b>of</b> these old fields will pose significant scientific and policy challenges...|$|R
50|$|Neoliberalism {{dictates}} that {{universities and colleges}} must look for their own funding in order to operate.

In line with market capitalism, neoliberalism seeks to restructure the public orientation of education by steering it away from state control towards the private sphere. With corporate interests being allowed {{to gain control of}} schools, the capitalist-led international development assistance agencies have been actively pushing for ICT in the education system.|$|R
40|$|Human {{activity}} {{is a factor}} strongly influencing the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> vegetation.

Libanotis pyrenaica, a host plant for Orobanche bartlingii, is {{a great example of}} species that spread {{as a result of this}} process, especially in the area of the Silesian-Cracow Upland. The aim of this study is to show that the expansion of L. pyrenaica caused by changes in land use promotes spreading of O. bartlingii - a species rare in Poland and Europe. During the field research conducted in the last decade, further localities of O. bartlingii were found. The gathered data were summarized to supplement the known distribution of the species and to present floristic and ecological characteristics of the phytocenoses with the participation of L. pyrenaica and O. bartlingii...|$|R
