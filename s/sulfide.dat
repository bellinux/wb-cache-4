40|$|Allyl <b>sulfides</b> {{have gained}} {{traction}} {{in recent years}} as promoters for olefinmetathesis. The high reactivity of allyl <b>sulfides</b> in olefin metathesis is remarkable, given that many sulfur-containing substrates are incompatible with ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalysts. In stark contrast, allyl <b>sulfides</b> actually enhance the rate ofmetathesis in comparison with other alkenes, when matched with a suitable catalyst. This review examines how the high reactivity of allyl <b>sulfides</b> in olefin metathesis has been harnessed in diverse areas of synthesis.
