40|$|Disease {{and damage}} from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{continually}} threaten the livelihood of agricultural producers {{and the economy}} in the United States, as well as challenge state and federal wildlife managers. Threats can be partially addressed by excluding free-ranging deer from livestock-related resources. Throughout the year, use of <b>stored</b> livestock <b>feed</b> by deer in northern Lower Michigan (MI), USA fluctuates, though their presence is relatively consistent. Since 2008, use of livestock areas and resources by deer has been reduced through intensive efforts by livestock producers in cooperation with state and federal agencies. These efforts focused on excluding deer from <b>stored</b> cattle <b>feed</b> in areas where deer were abundant. We monitored deer activity from Jan 2012 to June 2013 on 6 cattle farms in northern MI using GPS collars to evaluate behavioral effects of excluding deer from <b>stored</b> <b>feed.</b> We characterized areas deer occupied before and after installing 2361 m of fences and gates to exclude deer from <b>stored</b> cattle <b>feed.</b> Following fence installation, 9 deer previously accessing <b>stored</b> <b>feed</b> shifted to patterns of habitat use similar to 5 deer that did not use <b>stored</b> <b>feed.</b> However, continued attempts to regain access to <b>stored</b> <b>feed</b> were made at low frequencies, emphasizing the need to maintain the integrity of fences and keep gates closed for damage prevention and biosecurity...|$|R

40|$|A 13 -year {{summary of}} the Iowa State University Extension Service’s Beef Cow Business Record (BCBR) was {{compiled}} to show the trends in cost, profit, and production for beef-cow enterprises in Iowa. During these 13 years, 966 yearly records were summarized on herds with an average size of 74. 6 cows. Each year-end summary sorts the producers with profits in the top and the bottom thirds of the group so that differences can be analyzed. The average cost to maintain a beef cow from 1982 to 1994 was $ 370. 80. Cost components included in this average total were: feed and pasture, $ 177. 10; operating, $ 45. 40; depreciation, taxes, and insurance, $ 19. 70; labor, $ 44. 90; and capital, $ 83. 70. Producers sorted into the top one-third profit group had 13 -year average total cow costs of $ 309. 80, but the bottom onethird profit group averaged $ 437. 10. Economic returns per cow for these same 13 years were: return to capital, labor, and management, $ 139. 50; return to labor and management, $ 56. 20; and net profit, $ 20. 20. Top-profit producers had an average net profit of $ 126. 20 per cow, whereas the least profitable group had an average loss of $ 107. 40. Of this $ 233. 60 difference, $ 127. 30 was due to production cost, and the remaining $ 106. 30 was caused by gross return differences. The average number of pounds of beef produced per cow from 1984 through 1994 was 567. This production was achieved with 2. 5 acres of pasture, 3. 9 acres of cornstalk grazing, and 4, 675 pounds of <b>stored</b> <b>feed</b> per cow unit. Top-profit producers used 673 pounds of <b>stored</b> <b>feed</b> per hundredweight of production, but the least profitable producers used 1, 015 pounds.

30|$|The {{records show}} that feed and labor {{accounted}} for the highest share of the total costs. The feed cost was 51 % to 86 %, while labor was 11 % to 44 %.

Herders can control feed costs by maximizing the use of pasture, producing their own harvested <b>feeds,</b> buying and <b>storing</b> <b>feed</b> in bulk, and minimizing feed wastage. Even though the cost of veterinarian medications is very low, it accounted for 0 % to 3 % of the total variable cost, and had a tangible impact on improving herd productivity.|$|R
