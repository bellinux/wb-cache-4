As one of the most cited in Google Scholar, the Luftman’s survey instrument emerges as a promising one to assess business-IT alignment. This work presents a critical review of the Luftman’s proposal for assessing business-IT alignment by comparing it with six other relevant proposals in the literature. Each one of the selected proposals was studied in terms of the coverage of the dimensions of the Luftman’s instrument: communications, competency/value measurements, governance, partnership, technology scope and <b>skills.</b> <b>Governance</b> was the dimension better covered followed by the technology scope but the remaining dimensions were not so well covered with the skills dimension being the worst one. In fact, none of the selected proposals showed up as complete as the Luftman’s proposal. Some research has already been carried out to validate and test the Luftman’s instrument as a useful tool for practitioners and managers. The result, a more parsimonious instrument than the original one, seems a promising tool calling for further attention and use in research to get to an acceptable and recognized valid instrument to assess business-IT alignment.

Consequently, Ulugh Beg marched against Ala-ud-Daulah and met him in battle at Murghab. Having won this battle, Ulugh Beg advanced toward Herat and massacred its people in 1448, but Ala-ud-Daulah's brother Mirza Abul-Qasim Babur bin Baysonqor came to his aid, defeating Ulugh Beg. Ulugh Beg retreated to Balkh, where he found that its governor, his oldest son Abdal-Latif Mirza, had rebelled against him. Another civil war ensued. Within two years, he was beheaded by the order of his own eldest son while on his way to Mecca.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The {{intention}} {{with this}} research {{was to investigate the}} challenges facing School Governing Bodies (SGBs) in historically disadvantaged schools with regard to their roles and responsibilities. The investigation departed from the premise of prescriptions of the South African Schools Act and other relevant legislation. From the literature review, it became clear that school governance would not be an easy task for schools, based on the precedence set by the apartheid school governance system. Indeed, it was found that SGBs in previously disadvantaged schools experienced numerous challenges. Decentralisation, stakeholder participation in school governance, SGB membership, determination of school policies requiring specialised knowledge and expertise, and policy-making and implementation were found to encapsulate most of the challenges facing SGBs in their roles and responsibilities. This research, being qualitative and phenomenological, used interviews to focus on some definitive school governance roles and responsibilities. Findings largely confirmed earlier research findings and included challenges such as a poor understanding of the school governance role of promoting {{the best interests of the}} school by school governors, the execution of roles and responsibilities being inhibited by poor training and poor capacity building, parent governors lacking knowledge and school <b>governance</b> <b>skills,</b> school <b>governance</b> functions requiring specialised knowledge and skills, a lack of trust, and the influence of suspicion and poor teamwork among school governors. The main recommendation relates to the review of the Schools Act in terms of specialised functions and who should perform them, and increasing the terms of office of school governors to derive maximum benefit from continuity before new members are elected and another cycle of capacity-building is needed. It is further recommended that the roles and responsibilities of school governors be well explained to stakeholders, even before nominations and elections are conducted, so that potential governors know exactly what is expected, and that continuous capacity-building becomes a regular feature at school level, including a school cluster-based programme addressing local school governance challenges.

40|$|Indigenous Australians have {{a growing}} {{capacity}} to extract monetary payments from mineral development on their traditional lands. Considerable controversy surrounds the possible {{use of these}} payments to fund services such as health, housing and education for the Indigenous groups concerned. Critics of such an approach argue that government should provide basic public services to all citizens, and that use of 'mining payments' for service provision denies Indigenous people specific compensation for the negative impacts of mining and an important opportunity to enhance their economic status. There is also a danger that government may reduce its existing spending on services, leaving Indigenous people no better off {{as a result of}} allowing mining to occur. This article argues that while there are certainly risks involved in using mining payments to fund services, Indigenous groups can generate substantial net benefits by doing so. Mining payments can leverage additional government spending; fund services at a level or of a sort that government will not provide; give Indigenous people greater control over service provision; and help develop Indigenous organisational <b>skills</b> and <b>governance</b> capacity. A strategic approach is required to minimise risk and maximise the available benefits, and the article identifies policy principles that can be applied to secure such an outcome.

500|$|The {{reign of}} Robert II has {{undergone}} a re-appraisal since the works of historians Gordon Donaldson (1967) and Ranald Nicholson (1974). [...] Donaldson admits to a paucity of knowledge (at {{the time that he}} was writing) regarding Robert's reign and accepts that the early chroniclers writing near to his reign found little to criticise. [...] Robert's career before and after he succeeded to the throne is described by Donaldson as [...] "to say the least, undistinguished, and his reign did nothing to add lustre to it." [...] Donaldson goes further and debates the legality of the canon law marriage of Robert and Elizabeth Mure following the papal dispensation, but acknowledges that the Acts of Succession in 1371 and 1372, although sealing the matter in the eyes of Parliament, did not end the generational feud of the descendants of Elizabeth Mure and of Euphemia Ross. [...] Robert's earlier participation in combat at the battles of Halidon and Neville's Cross, according to Donaldson, had made him wary of sanctioning military expeditions against the English and that any such actions by his barons were concealed from him. Similarly, Nicholson described Robert's reign as deficient and that his lack of the <b>skills</b> of <b>governance</b> led to internal strife. [...] Nicholson asserts that the Earl of Douglas was bought off following his armed demonstration just before Robert's coronation, and associates this with the doubt surrounding the legitimacy of Robert's sons with Elizabeth Mure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Sustained {{cooperative}} {{action is}} required to improve {{the mental health of}} populations, particularly in low and middle-income countries where meagre mental health investment and insufficient human and other resources result in poorly performing mental health systems. The Observatory The International Observatory on Mental Health Systems is a mental health systems research, education and development network that will {{contribute to the development of}} high quality mental health systems in low and middle-income countries. The work of the Observatory will be done by mental health systems research, education and development groups that are located in and managed by collaborating organisations. These groups will be supported by the IOMHS Secretariat, the International IOMHS Steering Group and a Technical Reference Group. Summary The International Observatory on Mental Health Systems is: 1) the mental health systems research, education and development groups; 2) the IOMHS Steering Group; 3) the IOMHS Technical Reference Group; and 4) the IOMHS Secretariat. The work of the Observatory will depend on free and open collaboration, sharing of knowledge and <b>skills,</b> and <b>governance</b> arrangements that are inclusive and that put the needs and interests of people with mental illness and their families at the centre of decision-making.

After finishing their training, some women would stay to train newly arrived girls, while lower-ranking women might be chosen to be secondary wives of the Sapa Inca, if he wished it, or be sent as rewards to other men who had done something to please the sovereign.|$|R

His narrative is invigorated by many dialogues, not only of those {{in which he was}} a speaker but even of conversations that he only was told about by others. Their exactitude may be suspect but surely they give a memorable portrait of his times. Many judgments are supported by quotes from his stockpile of documents. Naturally his narration is colored by his complicated relationship with his subject: close friendship, working together intimately for years, followed by dismissal and humiliating rejection. He tries to be balanced and gives many examples of Napoleon’s brilliance, his <b>skill</b> at <b>governance,</b> and his deft political maneuvers, while deploring his inexorable grabs for personal and familial power and wealth, his willingness to sacrifice French lives, and his abhorrence of a free press. Military campaigns are left for professional judges. One of his bombshells is the claim that the Grand Army based at Boulogne was never meant to invade England, too chancy an enterprise: it was a diversion to keep British forces at home. Of course the book infuriated devoted Bonapartists; two volumes of criticisms were published promptly to attack his credibility.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Luton Business School, University of Luton, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe theme of this thesis is the involvement of employees from business/industry in the governance of state schools in England and Wales. Following a conceptual analysis and the identification of imprecision in the relevant legislation, the research was designed in two phases. The Phase 1 survey examined the extent of that involvement in 1994 and built up a profile of employee-governors, including their personal and company characteristics. A questionnaire was used to gather descriptive and enumerative data from the school governors employed by twelve national companies, with further qualitative data amassed through some open questions on the questionnaire a,!d from semi-structured interviews of company managers. From 1995 to 1997, Phase 2 assessed the purposes, functions and skills of governors from this sector, through a quasi-experimental design which gathered pre-test and post-test data from thirty-five co-opted business/industrial governors, their headteachers and their chairs of governors. A Likert-type scaling instrument and focus group discussions were used. The main findings from the 1994 survey were that there were few governors from business and industry and even fewer were in governance to represent that sector of the community; most were parent governors. These governors and their company managers felt, however, that there were appreciable benefits {{to be gained from}} company employees being school governors. Phase 2 showed that the sample of specifically co-opted business/industrial governors adopted the distinctive purposes of objectivity and non-executive judgement, and brought generic management <b>skills</b> to <b>governance</b> through their company experience at a strategic level. These skills were especially appreciated in inner city schools.

40|$|In both {{developed}} and developing countries poor performance of head teachers is detrimental to school effectiveness, with consequent economic costs amounting to billions of dollars every year. These costs are perhaps particularly keenly felt in developing countries, where demand for a workforce that is proficient in globally relevant competencies is especially acute, but where the effective school leadership that can help to deliver this educated workforce is especially patchy. One of the contributing factors to this poor performance {{is a lack of}} structured leadership development programmes. This study, therefore, explores the factors pertinent to effective school leadership development programmes in a resource poor education system, taking Cameroon as its example. The study combines a review of the academic literature with field document analysis evidence, structured interviews with head teachers and teachers, and a Leadership and Management Development Questionnaire (LMDQ) study. The results in particular indicate that the central educational agencies, schools and school leaders recognized the importance of ensuring that central policies and support, schools’ internal policies, and their in-service development opportunities for aspiring head teachers, are closely aligned with international best practice, particularly through the establishment of a structured leadership development programme targeted at aspiring head teachers, and aimed at combining <b>governance</b> <b>skills</b> with a more global outlook. ...|$|R

40|$|SIA LITERACY HAS {{important}} implications {{for the development of}} civics and citizenship education (CCE) in Australian schools (ACARA, 2012; Commonwealth of Australia, 2012). In the new Australian Curriculum, CCE is recognised as a significant and distinct learning area within the Humanities and Social Sciences, and as an essential focus in Australian education (ACARA, 2012; MCEETYA, 2008). The aim of civics and citizenship education is to empower young people to be active participants in local, national, regional and global communities. Clearly, there are synergies with studies of Asia. In broad terms, civics involves knowledge, understanding and <b>skills</b> related to <b>governance</b> and the organisation of civil society. It encompasses the study of democracy, its origins, development, structures and processes. Civics prepares students to think critically about how a democratic society functions for the public good, as well as studies of other systems of government a cross the world. The focus of citizenship education is on developing attitudes, beliefs, values and skills for participation and engagement in civic life. Following Marshall (1950), this notion of citizenship is informed by concepts such as rights and responsibilities, participation and representation, as well as social values and community involvement. We address the notion of practising citizenship in multi dimensional ways (McLaughlin, 2006) and explore how citizenship education and Asia literacy can mutually reinforce each other through ‘critical citizenship’ teaching and learning, aiming for transformative approaches to education (Dejaeghere & Tudball, 2007; Henderson, 2010; Tudball & Henderson, 2013). We see civics and citizenship as a curriculum area requiring whole school approaches, experiential pedagogy and strong connections with Asia literacy...|$|R

Another issue at hand is how educational institutions do not provide studies to equip students with the necessary skills to obtain entry level employment after they graduate. The markets and business environments changing almost every day and so do the skills set required by professional accountants. The purpose of the study is to assist professional accountants in defining the skills required for management positions and to enable them to plan their careers better. For this purpose the research method was a non-experimental design. A cross-sectional survey was used because the study was aimed to study several groups of individuals at one point in time. The majority of participants were registered at SAICA or CIMA. From the study the following was identified as the biggest shortcomings (gaps) between development during work and what is needed in a management position: • Intellectual skills, especially analytical thinking, decision-making and problem-solving. • Technical skills in other areas especially broader economic and business <b>skills,</b> financial management, <b>governance,</b> mathematical <b>skills,</b> risk management and strategic skills. • Personal skills, especially anticipating and adapting to change, benchmarking, ethics, lifelong learning, marketing, prioritising, seeing the bigger picture, self-management, striving to add value and taking initiative. • Business skills, especially mentoring, interacting with diverse people, leading effective meetings, listing and reading effectively, managing others, motivating others negotiating and communication. This study will benefit professional accountants in planning their careers and such involvements would result in more skilled professional accountants who will be better prepared to take on management positions. It can also assist professional bodies to better plan for CPD training. Master...|$|R

The project {{has been based on}} two important assumptions. These are, that: • There are Indigenous organisations in FNQ which for different reasons want to improve their governance; and • These organisations have a need for governance training and support, in addition to what is already available. The project involved three main steps. The first step was to undertake and document a limited review of literature on Indigenous governance issues and available training resources in FNQ. This review was then circulated to a number of Indigenous organisations in the Cairns region along with an invitation to attend a workshop (step two) which was held on 10 December 2012 at Queensland Government Offices in Cairns. The aim of the workshop was to provide an opportunity for participants to put forward their views on governance training and support requirements in FNQ, and to generate ideas and proposed actions for developing a regional approach for improvement. A list of participants who were able to attend the workshop is at Appendix 1. A copy of the workshop notes are in Appendix 2 (butchers’ paper notes) and Appendix 3 (scribe notes). The third step in the project has been to incorporate the workshop outcomes and the literature review into this short report, which is intended to provide the basis for a way forward for those Indigenous groups and organisations seeking to build <b>governance</b> <b>skills</b> and capacity in the region...|$|R
