40|$|Although path {{expressions}} in object-oriented query languages have materialized {{the capability}} of concisely manipulating the nested structures, their presence in query expressions require complex semantic considerations. However, none of currently existing visual query languages models such complex query expressions in a concise and intuitive way partly due to either the lackofwell-defined syntax and semantics of languages or improper representation of visual constructs for path expressions. In this paper, we present visual modeling of path expressions in a visual object-oriented database query language called Visual Object Query Language (VOQL) and proper modeling of the key features related to multi-valued path expressions. VOQL directly specifies the semantics of multi-valued path expressions by employing the visual notation capable of representing a set inclusion in addition to functional relationships. Specifically, the basic visual constructs called blobs, nested blobs, binding edges, and flattening edges are introduced. Blobs and nestedblobsare used to denote sets of objects that path expressions represent. Binding edges and flattening edges are designed to visually <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of variable binding {{and the notion of}} dot functions in path expressions. The grammar of these constructs defines the syntactic components suchasVOQL terms, VOQL formulas, and VOQL query expressions in a way as in tuple relational calculus. Their semantics are provided bysyntax directed translation to corresponding counterparts in Object-Oriented Predicate Calculus (OOPC). Also, in combination with a visual scoping box for universal quantification, the constructs allow explicit visual scoping and expressing the queries with nested quantification and recursion with [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> problem of <b>simulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> {{of a complex}} land vehicle moving in a natural environment. The {{contribution}} presented here is a motion generator which predicts the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle when executing a given nominal motion plan. This plan is {{expressed in terms of}} a channel to follow and of a set of intermediate subgoals to reach. Solving this motion generation problem requires to explicitly reason about the geometric and the physical aspects of the movements that the vehicle has to execute. In our approach, this is done using two basic constructions derived from the concept of physical model : the 'generalized obstades" are used for physically guiding the movements of the vehicle using an explicit model of the vehicle/terrain interactions, and the "physical targets' are used to map the strategic information onto our physical representation of the world and to introduce the force feedback gestural control...|$|R
40|$|Around {{twenty years}} ago two {{important}} developments happened {{in the areas of}} modularity and reuse in programming languages. On the one hand, Moggi showed how computational effects found in impure languages could be <b>simulated</b> using <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of monads from category theory. Inspired by Moggi’s work, Wadler showed how monads could be used to structure (purely functional) programs. On the other hand, work by Cook showed how variations of mixins could model different notions of inheritance (normally found in object-oriented languages) in simple, elegant and compositional ways, by using traditional techniques of fixed-point theory. Monads and mixins are helpful to handle different aspects of modularity and reuse in programming languages, yet they have been largely explored independently. In this paper we show that the combination of monads and mixins leads to a simple aspectoriented programming (AOP) style that can be used effectively in purely functional programming languages to write elegant, reusable and modular programs...|$|R

40|$|Physically based {{deformable}} {{models have}} been widely embraced by the Computer Graphics community. Many problems outlined in a previous survey by Gibson and Mirtich [GM 97] have been addressed, thereby making these models interesting and useful for both offline and real-time applications, such as motion pictures and video games. In this paper, we present the most significant contributions of the past decade, which produce such impressive and perceivably realistic animations and simulations: finite element/difference/volume methods, mass-spring systems, meshfree methods, coupled particle systems and reduced deformable models based on modal analysis. For completeness, we also make {{a connection to the}} simulation of other continua, such as fluids, gases and melting objects. Since time integration is inherent to all <b>simulated</b> phenomena, <b>the</b> general <b>notion</b> of time discretization is treated separately, while specifics are left to the respective models. Finally, we discuss areas of application, such as elastoplastic deformation and fracture, cloth and hair animation, virtual surgery simulation, interactive entertainment and fluid/smoke animation, and also suggest areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported and}} {{discussed in this}} thesis represents a novel approach to User Interface evaluation and optimisation through cognitive modelling. This is achieved through the development and testing of a toolkit or platform titled Toolkit for Optimisation of Interface System Evolution (TOISE). The research is conducted in two main phases. In phase 1, the Adaptive Control of Thought Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture is used to design Simulated Users (SU) models. This allows models of user interaction to be tested on a specific User Interface (UI). In phase 2, an evolutionary algorithm is added and used to evolve and test an optimised solution to User Interface layout based on the original interface design. The thesis presents a technical background, followed by an overview of some applications in their respective fields. The core concepts behind TOISE are introduced through {{a discussion of the}} Adaptive Control of Thought – Rational (ACT-R) architecture with a focus on the ACT-R models that are used to <b>simulate</b> users. <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> of adding a Genetic Algorithm optimiser is introduced and discussed in terms of the feasibility of using <b>simulated</b> users as <b>the</b> basis for automated evaluation to optimise usability. The design and implementation of TOISE is presented and discussed followed by a series of experiments that evaluate the TOISE system. While the research had to address and solve a large number of technical problems the resulting system does demonstrate potential as a platform for automated evaluation and optimisation of user interface layouts. The limitations of the system and the approach are discussed and further work is presented. It is concluded that the research is novel and shows considerable promise in terms of feasibility and potential for optimising layout for enhanced usability...|$|R

40|$|The de-excitation {{process of}} primary fission {{fragments}} can be <b>simulated</b> with <b>the</b> FIFRELIN Monte Carlo code {{leading to an}} estimation of prompt fission observables such as neutron/gamma multiplicities and spectra in correlation with fission fragments. De-excitation cascades are <b>simulated</b> using <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of nuclear realization following Becvar terminology generalized to neutron/gamma coupled emission. A nuclear realization is a random set of nuclear levels (energy, spin, parity) in association with partial widths for neutron, gamma or electron emission. Experimental data related to electromagnetic transitions in the discrete level region are taken from RIPL- 3 database. When nuclear level structure is completely unknown (in the continuum region), level density and strength function models are used. In between these regions, our partial knowledge of nuclear structure is completed by models up to a fixed maximum level density. In this way the whole available experimental information is accounted for. FIFRELIN is ruled by five free input parameters driving the excitation energy sharing, the rotational energy and the spin distribution of primary fission fragments. These five free parameters are determined to match a target observable such as the average total prompt neutron multiplicity (ν). Once this procedure is completed, the whole set of fission observables can be compared with experimental results. Obviously the number of observables obtained within this code is higher than what is available from measurements. This code can therefore provide useful insights into the compatibility between models and {{a whole set of}} fission observables. In the present work the influence of shell corrections is reported on level densities and prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS). The impact of the input data such as primary fission fragment total kinetic energy (TKE) is also addressed. Average prompt neutron multiplicity as a function of TKE is also estimated for each mass split and compared to recent measurements. The presence of structures in the calculations (especially for light nuclei) is clearly related to the nuclear level scheme. Various situations occur and an overestimation (or underestimation) of the calculated number of emitted neutrons can be correlated to the light or heavy fragment of a pair and to a restricted energy range. In addition prompt fission gamma spectra (PFGS) are estimated for selected fragment mass ranges and compared to recent measurements. In this way the presence of specific gamma-ray transitions can be established...|$|R

Generalizing the concept of superlocality, we define as super-correlation, the requirement for a larger dimension of the preshared randomness to <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> correlation than that of the quantum states that generate them. Since unsteerable states form a subset of Bell local states, it is an interesting question whether certain unsteerable states can be super-correlated.
