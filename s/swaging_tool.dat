To accomplish this increase in cycle life without increasing the size or weight of the tool would be engineering achievement. However, {{not only was the}} operational cycle life increased between 2 to 10 times but simultaneously the size and weight of the Swage Tool was decreased by about 50 percent. This accomplishment now becomes an outstanding engineering achievement. This achievement was only possible because of the computerized Patran, Nastran and Medusa programs...|$|E
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming process for rods and tubes. Infeed rotary swaging with {{structure in the}} reduction zone of the tools is investigated using a two dimensional finite element simulation. A few geometrical parameters are varied, for cosine and skew stairway shapes. The effective tool angle is kept constant. The influence is evaluated by the radial and axial process forces. Furthermore, the material flow is visualized by the neutral plane. The simulation results are quantitatively compared to each other to analyse the reaction force FA, which acts against the feeding force. Also, the results serve to find suitable geometries {{to be transferred to}} rotary swaging tools for practical application. It is shown that the shapes {{have a significant effect on}} the forces and the location of the neutral plane. Finally a first <b>swaging</b> <b>tool</b> is modified with an exemplary geometry for experimental investigations...|$|E
40|$|Rotary swaging is an {{incremental}} cold forming {{process for the}} manufacture of cylindrical light weight components such as axles and steering spindles and has a wide spread use in the automotive industry. The advantage of rotary swaging is the optimal use of work piece material resources. This is due to material strengthening through strain hardening {{and the ability to}} manufacture hollow parts with variable wall thicknesses. However, main drawback is the need for an extensive lubrication to control tool wear, to discharge abrasive particles from the forming zone, and to provide adequate work piece surface quality. The subsequent, inevitable cleaning of the work pieces after manufacture leads to a significant increase of costs per unit. Thus, the development of rotary swaging towards a dry process layout is highly innovative both under economic and ecological aspects. The omission of lubricant provokes fundamentally changed tribological conditions in tool-work piece contact, leading to changes in process forces, increased abrasive and adhesive tool wear and reduced work piece quality. A robust, lubricant free rotary swaging, offering the same product quality as a conventional rotary swaging process with the use of lubricant, therefore implies the control of the modified tribological properties by methodologies substituting the tasks of the lubricant. This work shows an interdisciplinary approach for the development of dry rotary swaging, that comprises the FE modeling and simulation of the rotary swaging process for general process understanding and designing; the micro structuring of the rotary <b>swaging</b> <b>tool</b> surfaces for control of friction and process forces; and the development of tungsten doped a-C:H tool hard coatings for the reduction of abrasive and adhesive wear of the tools...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of micro rotary swaging, the local properties of the tools should be adjusted properly with respect to abrasive and adhesive wear, compressive strength, and toughness. These properties can be optimally combined by using different materials in specific regions of the tools, with a gradual transition in between to reduce critical stresses at the interface during heat treatment and in the rotary swaging process. In this study, a newly developed co-spray forming process was used to produce graded tool material {{in the form of a}} flat product. The graded deposit was subsequently hot rolled and heat treated to achieve an optimal microstructure and advanced properties. Micro plunge rotary <b>swaging</b> <b>tools</b> with fine geometrical structures were machined from the hot rolled material. The new forming tools were successfully applied in the micro plunge rotary swaging of wires of stainless steel...|$|R
5000|$|As a blacksmithing tool, {{a fuller}} {{is a type}} of swage. A <b>swage</b> is a <b>tool</b> that has a {{particular}} shape forged into its surface, which is used to imprint that shape into the metal. <b>Swages</b> are often <b>tools</b> with handles and various shaped heads, which are placed between the hammer and the workpiece, allowing the smith to work the steel into various shapes that would be impossible to make with a hammer alone. Swage blocks are often anvil-like blocks with various shapes forged in them, also for forming metal.

40|$|AbstractRotary swaging {{is a cold}} bulk forming process. The {{diameter}} of the workpiece is reduced incrementally by oscillating movement of the tools. The established processes use lubricants which fulfill necessary functions such as lubricating, cooling and cleaning of the tools. Disadvantages caused {{by the use of}} lubricant are costs of recycling, replacement of lost coolant and for the cleaning of the workpiece. To eliminate the lubricant it is necessary to substitute the functions of the lubricant in other ways. For example by means of coating and structuring of the tools. In this study infeed rotary <b>swaging</b> with structured <b>tools</b> is investigated using finite element simulations. Different structures are implemented in the reduction zone of the tools. The influence is investigated by the radial and axial process forces. Additionally first structured tools are manufactured and experimentally tested. The results of modeling and testing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Micro {{rotary swaging}} {{is a cold}} forming process for {{production}} of micro components with determined geometry and surface. It is also possible to change the microstructure of wires and hence the material properties. Swaging dies revolve around the work piece with an overlaid radial oscillation. Newly developed tools (Flat Surface Dies, FSD) feature plain surfaces and do not represent the geometry of the formed part as in conventional <b>swaging.</b> Using these <b>tools</b> allows for producing wires with triangle geometry (cross section) {{as well as a}} circular shape. To test the influence of FSD on material properties by micro swaging a new method is investigated: the variation of the relative speed between the specimen and dies in infeed rotary swaging. During this specific process copper (C 11000) and steel (304  Alloy) wires with diameter d 0 = 1 [*]mm are formed. It is noticed that the mechanical characteristics such as ductility and strength differ from the characteristics after conventional swaging. Moreover this approach enables new possibilities to influence the geometry and the surface quality of wires. The impact of the relative speed on the processed wire features is described in this paper...|$|R
