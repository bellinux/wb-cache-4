5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are <b>subordinate</b> to it. <b>Subordinate</b> clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the <b>subordinate</b> clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a <b>subordinate</b> clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and <b>subordinate</b> clauses.|$|E

In this paper, we analyse how <b>subordinated</b> debt may affect both bank riskiness and the effectiveness of bank supervision. We take into account the ability and incentives of <b>subordinated</b> debt holders to exercise market discipline. We show that requiring banks to hold <b>subordinated</b> debt should reduce bank risk and allow a better allocation of supervisory ressources.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} why <b>subordinates</b> trust their managers based on the responses from 108 <b>subordinates</b> of seven Slovenian managers and from 138 <b>subordinates</b> of eight Swedish managers. The <b>subordinates</b> of these managers responded to a 20 -item instrument tested for reliability and validity. In both samples the managers enjoyed different degrees of trust. The level of trust vested in Slovenian managers was higher than in Swedish ones. The kinds of managers’ actions that enhanced trust were similar amongst Swedish and Slovenian <b>subordinates.</b> Different socio-cultural contexts may theoretically explain why some other kinds of actions had contrasting effects between the samples. On the whole, the actions of managers explain trust in both countries. Subordinates’ trust in managers declines with the increasing hierarchical distance in both national samples.

The supervisors completed a short version of the Active Listening Attitude Scale (ALAS) consisting of two subscales: Listening Attitude and Listening Skill for Active Listening. The <b>subordinates</b> rated working conditions and their psychological stress reactions using selected scales of the Job Content Questionnaire and the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Those <b>subordinates</b> who worked under supervisors with a higher score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill reported a more favorable psychological stress reaction than those who worked under supervisors with a lower score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill.
