[...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not {{really one of the}} better action games around. It does nothing new {{and there are a lot}} of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming reticule for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections.

The promise of <b>seamless</b> end-to-end <b>integration</b> has proven alluring to the increasingly networked business world. But <b>seamless</b> end-to-end <b>integration</b> requires secure transactions. In this paper, therefore, we examine security and transactions in RosettaNet business processes. Security has been gaining attention with the recent onslaught of virus attacks. In B 2 B integration, security is essential in ensuring trust between trading partners. We evaluated the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) against eight security criteria and found that it offers good support for most security aspects. Nevertheless, it also leaves many factors to be specified in process descriptions and trading partner agreements, which may result in an insufficient security level. We then compared the relative importance of the eight security aspects at three pulp and paper companies. Support for many aspects of security requires the use of digital certificates, so we next evaluated how certificates are handled in RosettaNet. For the most part, RosettaNet makes dealing with certificates easy, but there are security issues with certificates that have not been resolved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{paper is}} devoted to develop {{efficient}} domain decomposition methods for the linear Schrödinger equation beyond the semiclassical regime, which does not carry a small enough rescaled Planck constant for asymptotic methods (e. g. geometric optics) to produce a good accuracy, but which is too computationally expensive if direct methods (e. g. finite difference) are applied. This belongs to the category of computing middle-frequency wave propagation, where neither asymptotic nor direct methods can be directly used with both efficiency and accuracy. Motivated by recent works of the authors on absorbing boundary conditions [X. Antoine et al, J. Comput. Phys., 277 (2014), 268 – 304] and [X. Yang and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 52 (2014), 808 – 831], we introduce Semiclassical Schwarz Waveform Relaxation methods (SSWR), which are <b>seamless</b> <b>integrations</b> of semiclassical approximation to Schwarz Waveform Relaxation methods.
