40|$|The layered double {{hydroxides}} {{are obtained}} by the stacking of metal hydroxide layers one above another. The stacking sequence {{is determined by the}} molecular symmetry of the intercalated anion. Anions <b>select</b> <b>for</b> those stacking sequences which provide interlayer sites having a local symmetry compatible with their own molecular symmetry. Oxoanions, XO 3 n- (X = S, I), are unique in that their molecular symmetry, C 3 v, is compatible with two different polytypes of rhombohedral symmetry. The SO 3 2 - ion <b>selects</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> more ubiquitous 3 R 1 polytype, whereas the IO 3 - ion <b>selects</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> much rarer 3 R 2 polytype. Structure refinement shows that neither anion departs significantly from the structure of the free species on intercalation. The higher charge-to-size ratio of the SO 3 2 - ion compared to the IO 3 - ion and its consequent stronger basicity is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nucleation of the 3 R 1 polytype, wherein the trigonal prismatic interlayer sites facilitate the superior hydrogen bonding capacity of the SO 3 2 - ion. The poorer basicity of the IO 3 - ion and its consequent poorer proclivity to form hydrogen bonds <b>select</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 3 R 2 polytype wherein the IO 3 - ion is lodged in interlayer sites of octahedral symmetry.
