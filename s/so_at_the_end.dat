5|$|Smallpeice, {{with support}} from E. H. Carr who was then {{assistant}} editor of The Times, promoted the idea of employers deducting income tax from wages and passing it to Government directly rather than waiting for employees to do <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the financial year. He introduced this idea to Paul Chambers, then {{on the board of}} the Inland Revenue. The idea, which became the PAYE system, would be tested in 1940–1941 and introduced permanently in 1944. The system vastly simplified and increased tax collection during the latter stages of World War II, when Britain was in desperate need of funds.|$|E
5|$|When the {{commander}} of the newly renamed 90th Light Afrika Division, Generalmajor Max Sümmermann, was killed in an Allied air raid on 10 December 1941, Mickl was appointed to temporarily command the division. During December, Mickl was wounded in the head and hand, but remained at his post. Rommel recommended Mickl for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, for his leadership at Sidi Rezegh, and it was duly awarded on 13 December 1941. The harsh conditions of desert warfare had begun to affect Mickl's health, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of December he was sent home on convalescent leave.|$|E
5|$|With Jock in {{increasingly}} {{poor health}} after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian {{to start a}} life in the United States {{with the help of}} Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodesia in early-1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and Chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree ("by some miracle", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{the series}} finale was planned as a two-hour event. Unfortunately UPN only ordered 22 episodes {{instead of the}} {{required}} 23. This was why stories were <b>so</b> rushed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> according to Gellar.|$|R
25|$|Helms also {{suggested}} that since he could retire when he turned 60, he might voluntarilly do <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of March. So it was agreed, apparently. But instead the event came without warning as Helms was abruptly dismissed when James R. Schlesinger was named the new DCI on February 2, 1973.|$|E
25|$|For example, suppose someone {{deposits}} $100 with a {{bank for}} 1 year, and they receive interest of $10 (before tax), <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the year, their balance is $110 (before tax). In this case, {{regardless of the}} rate of inflation, the nominal interest rate is 10% per annum (before tax).|$|E
25|$|The overall {{centre of}} Company {{administration}} was Salisbury, {{which was also}} the Southern Rhodesian capital. The administrative centre in North-Eastern Rhodesia was Fort Jameson, while in North-Western Rhodesia the capital was Kalomo initially, and Livingstone from 1907. Livingstone became the capital of Northern Rhodesia when the two northern territories joined in 1911, and remained <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Company rule.|$|E

25|$|Coldplay {{wanted it}} to be an {{explosion}} of vivid colours as a counterpoint to the subdued colour palette of Viva La Vida, {{and at the same time}} there were lots of lyrics and codes they wished to add. Researches and development into street art started six months before the work had begun. Then a graffiti wall was painted by the band itself and Paris, formed by nine parts. Tappin Gofton wanted the whole evolution of the wall, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of every day loads of super detailed photos would be taken from it. In the end a picture including three parts of the wall was featured on the front cover, while the whole wall is featured on the center of the CD's booklet.|$|E
25|$|First {{they made}} a major four player swap with the Wichita Wings. The deal in {{principle}} was to see Drillers captain Bill Sedgewick and 'keeper Pat Onstad head to the Wings, in exchange for defender LeBaron Hollimon, and midfielder Sterling Westcott. In actuality, there was a fair bit of underhanded dealing on both sides, as the Drillers knew that Onstad {{had no intention of}} returning to play indoor, and Wichita knew Westcott had no intention of reporting as he had agreed to a deal with a WISL club. Beyond that, Sedgewick made it clear he didn't want to play for anyone but Edmonton, and then decided to also sign with a WISL club in Utah, where he also had business interests. <b>So,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the ordeal the only player that ended up reporting was LeBaron Hollimon.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Just {{made the}} {{proposal}} that deputies from the Convention should directly oversee all military efforts, which was approved on 10 October 1793. Amid worsening {{conditions at the}} front {{in the fall of}} that year, several deputies were sent to the critical area of Alsace to shore up the disintegrating Army of the Rhine. Results were not sufficiently forthcoming, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the month Saint-Just himself was sent there along with an ally from the Convention, Philippe-François-Joseph Le Bas. The two men were charged with [...] "extraordinary powers" [...] to impose discipline and reorganize the troops.|$|E

60|$|The new pitcher was a {{left-hander}} who had {{rather a}} puzzling delivery, and {{he managed to}} retire the side without any more runs, <b>so</b> that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> eighth inning the score stood 7 to 2 in favor of Colby Hall.|$|R

He also made a surprise cameo appearance on stage with Lady Gaga at Hayarkon Park, Tel Aviv, the previous evening. The performance took place days before the release that month of the two stars' much-delayed collaborative effort and resultant Grammy-winning album, Cheek to Cheek, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, extending the 88-year-old Bennett's record for the oldest artist to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 2014, Bennett and Lady Gaga kicked off their co-headlining Cheek to Cheek Tour.

500|$|By October, it was rumoured in {{high society}} and abroad that Edward {{intended}} to marry Simpson {{as soon as}} she was free to do <b>so.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of that month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent. The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: [...] "The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson {{is not going to be}} maintained... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous." [...] Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1966, Pink Floyd {{had gained}} a {{reliable}} management team in Andrew King and Peter Jenner. Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up Blackhill Enterprises, to manage the group's finances. Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, and among others, Barrett's flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager, however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant). King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of October, they booked a session at Thompson Private Recording Studio, in Hemel Hempstead. King said of the demos: [...] "That {{was the first time}} I realised they were going to write all their own material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight." ...|$|E

60|$|The river, its brief {{glimpse at}} civilization over, relapsed again into utter savagery. Rocks and trees, as wild {{apparently}} as their first forerunners there, walled us {{in on the}} sides, and appeared to do <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends,</b> making exit seem an impossibility, and entrance {{to have been a}} dream. The stream gave short reaches, disclosing every few minutes, as it took us round a fresh turn, a new variation on the old theme. Then, as we glided straight our few hundred feet, the wall behind us rose higher and higher, stretching out at us as if to prevent our possible escape. We had thought it only a high cliff, and behold it was the whole mountain side that had stood barrier there.|$|R

2500|$|Murrow {{achieved}} great {{celebrity status}} {{as a result of}} his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with [...] "good night, and good luck." [...] The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said [...] "good night, and good luck to you all". <b>So,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with [...] "Good night, and good luck."

2500|$|Born in Chicago, Dixon {{began his}} {{professional}} baseball career in [...] {{at the age}} of 25 with the Moline Plowboys of the Three-I League. His strong throwing arm attracted the attention of Jack Hendricks, then the manager of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. Dixon spent three seasons with Indianapolis, but saw little playing time, <b>so</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the [...] season, he asked for the club to release him. All the teams in the league passed on making an offer for his services except for the St. Paul Saints. Given a chance to play every day with the Saints in , Dixon posted a [...]272 batting average with 10 home runs in 149 games. His solid defensive abilities as a catcher helped the Saints win the 1924 American Association pennant.|$|E
2500|$|As a bowler, Procter had {{an awkward}} chest on action, seeming to bowl off the wrong foot (though not {{actually}} doing <b>so)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of an intimidating run. [...] His unusual action generated late inswing which, {{in the right}} conditions, could be unplayable at times. He bowled at high pace in his pomp but later in his career knee problems caused by the impact of his bull-like body on the bowling crease forced him to turn to off-spin. [...] Typically he proved adept at this too. [...] His muscular batting in the middle order was famed for its power, although based on a sound defence. [...] He {{was one of those}} rare cricketers who could have found a place in any test team as either a batsman or bowler and who could win a game single handed with bat or ball in his hand.|$|E

It is caused by pollution, and it is a serious threat to our health and welfare. We need to confront these realities, not put our heads in the sands." [...] On April 7, 2011 the bill passed the House by a vote of 255 to 172. No Republican opposed it; 19 Democrats supported it.
