2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

Plant tissues of Poaceae species (corn, pearl millet, and sorghum) were enriched in pentoses relative to other plant species. A principal component analysis showed a close positive relationship of the soil aggregate MWD with the soil xylose content, but not with other soil monosaccharide and SOC contents, and a positive relationship with the amount of pentose input to the soil, notably from aboveground plant materials. A possible explanation is that pentosans are used as an energy source by filamentous microorganisms, which play a well-known role in stabilizing soil aggregates.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Moisture of corn stover was field {{monitored}} under southeast U. S. {{ambient conditions}} to aid biomass collection decisions. Timing to collect stover at low moisture depended on elapsed time on field, elapsed time after precipitation, time of day, contact with <b>soil,</b> and <b>conditioning</b> effect by combine header. Grain had been combine-harvested at kernel moistures of either 25 % or 15 % wet basis (w. b.). Stover moisture {{was determined by}} weighing large in-situ baskets {{for a month and}} with frequent grab samples. Experiment controls included stover dried under tent shelter and mower-cut stover for combine-conditioning effect. Stover moisture asymptotically declined over time from approximately 70 % (w. b.) to an equilibrium of approximately 20 % (w. b.) for 25 % (w. b.) grain harvest. Moisture reduction was not constant due to daily diurnal variation of eight percentage points (w. b.), and light precipitation that re-hydrated the stover. Stover moisture was significantly greater in the morning compared to afternoon and was greater for stover in contact with soil. A combine corn stalk conditioning effect reduced mean moisture (approx. 10 percentage points) for high-moisture stover at early harvest, yet conditioning increased moisture for a period after light precipitation. Correlation of daily stover moisture with the corresponding day’s evapotranspiration factor was not as strong as correlations with other combinations of environmental factors. Stover moisture generally peaked two days after rain events, so correlations and regressive predictions used previous data (2 -day delay) for rainfall, air relative humidity, and evapotranspiration data.

In this study, the polypedon concept was used to extend the spatial representation of sampled pedons (point data) in order to train artificial neural networks (ANN) for digital soil mapping (DSM). The input database contained 97 soil profiles belonging to seven different soil series and 15 digital elevation model (DEM) attributes. Pedons were represented in raster format as 1 cell areas. The corresponding polypedons were then spatially represented by neighbouring raster cells (e. g. 2 × 2, ¿ up to 6 × 6 cells). The primary database contained 97 pedons (97 cells) that were extended up to 3492 cells (in the case of 6 × 6 cell regions).

The results showed an increase of theincreased accuracies of in training and interpolation (test area), but a poor level of accuracyaccuracy of in the extrapolation process (validation area). However, the overall precision of all predictions greatly increased considerably. Using only topographic attributes for extrapolation was not sufficient to obtain an accurate soil map.

40|$|Cleaning of {{particulate}} soils is {{an important}} issue in food and pharmaceutical production. Understanding the adherence of these soils is a fundamental requirement for improving surfaces cleanability. The combination of particles and macromolecules substances appears in many processes. Adsorbed compounds from these mixtures may influence interactions at interfaces and thus fouling and cleaning. This thesis deals with {{a deeper understanding of the}} physico-chemical mechanisms affecting soiling and cleanability of open substrates in the presence of biomacromolecules (dextran, bovine serum albumin – BSA, beta-lactoglobulin – β-LGB). Model substrates were chosen according to their hydrophobicity. The influence of macromolecules was examined by introducing them in the quartz suspension taken as a model of hard hydrophilic soil used for <b>soiling,</b> or by <b>conditioning</b> the substrate prior to soiling. The substrates were pretreated with ethanol (-Eth.), piranha or UV-Ozone (-UVO); soiled by spraying the quartz suspensions, then dried, before cleaning assessment. The removal of the soiling particles was evaluated after exposure to water in a radial flow chamber (RFC). Auxiliary characterizations were surface tension and contact angle measurements, surface analysis of the substrate by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interpretation of XPS data allowed the complexity due to the ubiquitous presence of organic contaminants to be coped with, and the surface composition to be expressed in terms of both the amount of adlayer and the mass concentration of adlayer constituents. The contact of substrates with proteins led to their adsorption, which dominated the composition of the organic layer with respect to contaminants initially present, and was not markedly desorbed upon rinsing. Dextran was easily removed in presence of water, independently on the substrate nature. Surface hydrophobicity was shown to influence the morphology of the aggregates resulting from drying. The rounder aggregates formed on polystyrene when soiling was performed with suspension in pure water are more sensitive to wall shear stress than flatter ones formed on more hydrophilic substrate. This is the result of the competing processes of droplet rolling and coalescing, on the one hand, and droplet spreading, on the other hand. It affects the shape and compactness of the adhering aggregates, the efficiency of shear forces upon cleaning and finally, the adherence of soiling particles. The presence of proteins (either native or denatured) at the interface improved strongly the cleanability of more hydrophilic substrate (glass, StSteel-UVO). This is attributed to the lower surface tension. The dependence of cleanability on capillary forces, and in particular on the liquid surface tension, is predominant as compared with its dependence on the size and shape of the soiling aggregates, which influence the efficiency of shear forces exerted by the flowing water upon cleaning. The cleanability of less hydrophilic substrate (stainless steel only pre-cleaned with ethanol) did not change markedly in the presence of proteins; this may be due to a more complex interaction between surface tension and contact angle, on one hand, and a more complex interaction between proteins and contaminants, on the other hand. The presence of dextran did not affect the cleanability, as neither the liquid surface tension nor the contact angle was appreciably affected...|$|R
40|$|A {{relevant}} {{issue for}} accurate phosphorus fertilization management is to estimate phytoavailable phosphorus (P), which {{is defined as}} the amount of P present in soil that can be used by plants in successive crops until evident P deficiency symptoms appear in crop. It can be supposed that there is a starvation of this available pool when P release from solid phase does not maintain a high enough P concentration to maintain P adsorption by plants. This plant available P is normally assessed by "P availability indexes" or “soil P test” (SPT). However, the accuracy of these different methods, over a wide range of soils, may be limited and poor relationships are frequently observed between phosphorus availability indexes, such as Olsen P, and phosphorus absorption by plants. An efficient use of phosphorus in agriculture should be based on an accurate estimationof bio-available phosphorus in soils. In this thesis, focused on soils from Mediterranean environments, the Olsen P will be taken as a reference for SPT. In the first chapter of this PhD thesis, a general introduction to the problem of P in agriculture, with information regarding its relevance as non-renewable and strategic resource necessary in agriculture, was done. In this chapter, objectives of this thesis were defined, all focused on the sustainable use of P in agriculture. In the second chapter, factors affecting the accuracy of Olsen phosphorus index (Olsen-P) were studied. To this end, a P depletion experiment in 17 Mediterranean soils was carried out. Two samples differing widely in Olsen-P were used for each soil, named "low-P" and "high-P". The soil was mixed with silica sand to achieve 1 mg of P as Olsen-P per pot. Thus, the proportion of unavailable P to Olsen-P, either inorganic or organic P in the pot, was higher for "low- P" samples than for "high-P" samples. In "high-P" samples, P uptake by crop (cucumber) increased with increased affinity factor of soil phase, estimated from the P sorption curves (R 2 = 0. 76; P < 0. 001) and with increased P adsorption capacity of soil, estimated as the concentration of Fe in oxides in soils (R 2 = 0. 56; P < 0. 001). On the other hand, in "low-P" soil samples, total organic P and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere contributed to explain P absorption by crops(R 2 = 0. 37, P < 0. 01). These results revealed that both organic P and the hydrolytic activity in rhizosphere have implications in explaining P availability to plants when the ratio of organic P to Olsen P is high (low-P samples). On the other hand, the physical and chemical properties controlling the dynamics of inorganic P {{played an important role in}} the uptake of P from high-P samples. third chapter of this of this PhD Thesis was focused on the identification of soil properties affecting threshold values of Olsen P, below which a response by crop to P fertilization can be expected. There are recent evidences that, even in soils where a given SPT such as Olsen P is recommended, threshold values for SPT may range widely. This significantly affects the practical implications of SPT. Based on the soil properties affecting threshold values for Olsen P, models were proposed for the accurate estimation of threshold values in the interpretation of Olsen-P as SPT in these soils. This is basic for the identification of P responsive sites in geographical areas where this SPT is recommended. Threshold values for Olsen P and P in soil solution estimated by an extraction with 0. 01 MCaCl 2 varied widely between soils. Both indexes were positively correlated with each other (P < 0. 001). Clay content was the soil property affecting to a greater extend threshold values for Olsen P, explaining a 60 % of variation (P < 0. 001). Overall, Olsen P threshold values decreased with increased buffer capacity (estimated with adsorption isotherms at 1 mg P L- 1) and P sorption capacity (estimated as Fe in Fe oxides or clay). Threshold values for Olsen P can be predicted in studied soils by multiple regressions involving clay content, pH, and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere (R 2 = 0. 87, P < 0. 001); when only pH and clay were taken into account, it was explained 81 % of variation (P < 0. 001) with an average of the absolute error of 1. 12. This means that a single model based on pH and clay content can accurately estimate threshold values in the studied soils. In the case of PCaCl 2 threshold values can be estimated as a function of clay and the ratio of Fe in poorly crystalline to that in crystalline Fe oxides(R 2 = 0. 57, P < 0. 001). In addition, accurate predictions of PCaCl 2 threshold values can be also achieved based on multiple regressions with pH and phytase hydrolysable P in some P fractions. It can be concluded that, in the group of soils studied, soil properties related with P buffering capacity of soils are the most relevant explaining threshold values for both SPT tested. However, it should be highlighted the contribution of factors related to organic P dynamics affecting threshold values. The fourth chapter of this PhD Thesis was aimed to define more precise methods to estimate total plant available P (TAP). To this end, different P extraction methods were tested: (i) Olsen P (ii) P concentration in 0. 01 M CaCl 2, (iii) 0. 27 M Na citrate + 0. 11 M NaHCO 3 (CB), (iv) the two first sequential extractions in the Ruíz et al. (1997) fractionation scheme (NaOH +CB), (v) extraction with anion exchange resins (AER) in Cl- and HCO- 3 forms. Total available P (TAP) values in soils were obtained by P depletion experiment by growing plants successively in soils. TAP was significantly related to HCO 3 [...] AER but also with Cl-_ AER (R 2 = 87 % and 77 % respectively). In addition, variance of TAP explained by Cl-AER increased till 86 % if phytase hydrolysable P in NaOH and CB extracts was taken into account. AERs have proved to be sensitive not only to Q, but also to buffer capacity (BC). When Olsen P was considered as the only predictive variable, it only explained a 53 % of the TAP variation (mean value for wheat and sunflower, P < 0. 001). When the ratio Feca/Fecbd and the buffer capacity (BC) were also included as predictive variables in the model, variance explained increased to 69 and 61 %, respectively. When clay and CCE were included in the predictive model with Olsen P, variance explained increased till 80 %. Overall, better results obtained with AERs than with Olsen P or other single chemical extraction and were explained by their better relationship with most of the <b>soil</b> properties <b>conditioning</b> TAP. In the fifth chapter of this PhD Thesis, organic P forms and their potential contribution to available P to plants in Mediterranean soils were studied. Organic P in soil is the less understood aspect of the P cycle in soils, particularly in those from semiarid and arid lands. Organic P forms and how may be affected by P status and soil properties was dealt in this chapter. The study was carried out by NMR spectroscopy of 31 P (31 P NMR) in NaOH-EDTA extracts. From the soil collection used in the study described in chapter 1, eight representative Mediterranean soils were selected, and for each one, a "low-P" and "high-P" sample was studied. Organic P concentration in “high-P” and “low-P” samples was not significantly different. Beside this, the concentration of orthophosphate monoesters and their relative contribution to extracted P or OP according to the dry combustion method did not significantly differ between low- and high-P samples. Monoesters were the dominant fraction of OP accounting for half of the total organic P. The differences in monoesters phosphates between low- and high-P soil samples increased with increasing differences in Olsen P (R 2 = 0. 61, P < 0. 05). The mono- to diesters ratio increased with increased Olsen P in soil (R 2 = 0. 49; P < 0. 01), also monoesters and IP 6, as OP proportion, increased as increased Olsen P in soil in vineyards and olive orchards, where almost no crop residue accumulation occurs. All these results reveal that, under P starvations conditions, some hydrolysis of these OP forms and potential contribution to P supply to plants may be expected. Myo- IP 6 seems to stabilize by adsorption, as revealed by its positive relationship with the ratio of Fe in oxide to clay content and its decreased concentration in soil with increasing pH. On the other hand, precipitation of Ca phosphates may explain the retention of other IP 6 stereoisomers in these soils. A general discussion of results is done in the sixth chapter, and finally, exposition of main conclusions of the present work is presented in the seventh chapter. Una cuestión relevante para gestionar de manera precisa la fertilización fosfatada es estimar el fósforo (P) disponible para las plantas en el suelo, que se define como la cantidad de P presente en el suelo que puede ser utilizado por las plantas en cultivos sucesivos hasta que aparecen evidentes síntomas de deficiencia de P en el cultivo. Se puede suponer que hay una necesidad de aplicar este nutriente al suelo cuando la liberación de P desde la fase sólida no mantiene una concentración de P lo suficientemente alta para mantener la adsorción de P por las plantas. Este P disponible para la planta se evalúa normalmente utilizando los denominados "índices de disponibilidad de P" o "Tests de P en suelo" (SPT). Sin embargo, la exactitud de estos diferentes métodos aplicados a suelos con propiedades muy diferentes puede ser limitada y con frecuencia se observan malas relaciones entre los índices de disponibilidad de fósforo, tales como P Olsen, y la absorción de fósforo por las plantas. Un uso eficiente de fósforo en la agricultura se debe basar en una estimación precisa del fósforo biodisponible en los suelos. En esta Tesis Doctoral, centradaen suelos de ambientes mediterráneos, el P Olsen se tomará como referencia para el SPT. En el primer capítulo de esta Tesis Doctoral, se hizo una introducción general|$|R

40|$|Plant {{species can}} {{condition}} the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil {{in ways that}} modify plant growth via plant–soil feedback (PSF). Plant growth can be positively affected, negatively affected or neutrally affected by <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> by the same or other plant species. <b>Soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> by other plant species has particular relevance to ecological restoration of historic ecosystems because sites set aside for restoration are often conditioned by other, potentially non-native, plant species. We investigated changes in properties of jarrah forest soils after long-term (35 years) conditioning by pines (Pinus radiata), Sydney blue gums (Eucalyptus saligna), both non-native, plantation trees, and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata; dominant native tree). Then, we tested {{the influence of the}} conditioned soils on the growth of jarrah seedlings. Blue gums and pines similarly conditioned the physico-chemical properties of soils, which differed from <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> caused by jarrah. Especially important were the differences in conditioning of the properties C:N ratio, pH, and available K. The two eucalypt species similarly conditioned the biological properties of soil (i. e. community level physiological profile, numbers of fungal-feeding nematodes, omnivorous nematodes, and nematode channel ratio), and these differed from conditioning caused by pines. Species-specific conditioning of soil did not translate into differences in the amounts of biomass produced by jarrah seedlings and a neutral PSF was observed. In summary, we found that decades of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> by non-native plantation trees did not influence the growth of jarrah seedlings and will therefore not limit restoration of jarrah following the removal of the plantation trees...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{demonstration}} that tunnelling with EPB technology can be applied also in geological conditions considered out by the common applications range as in rock masses, and that the proper combination of conditioning additives can face some common problems that can occur in difficult soils for EPB tunnelling as clayey soils. In the first chapter a general overview of the EPB technology is carried out describing the most important technical features, the working principle and the common application fields {{of this kind of}} TBM. The second part of this chapter is an overview of the <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> techniques and of the <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> additives used in EPB tunnelling. The second chapter is the resume of the technical literature review about conditioned soil testing. This literature analysis has been carried out studying foe each <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> research topic the commonly used tests and the different tests proposed by many authors of different technical universities from all over the world. This research has been considered necessary to understand the state of art of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> testing in order to perform a research able to fill some research fields non yet deeply studied. The third chapter is the descriptions of all the <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> test that can be performed in the Tunnel and Underground Space Center laboratory of Politecnico di Torino where the tests reported in this research has been carried out with both commonly used and standardized test procedures, with experimental devices designed during the almost ten years of history of this laboratory and with specific test studied, designed realized and tested during this research. The fourth chapter is a research carried on with the aim to observe the differences between some commercial <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> additives commonly used for the treatment of clayey soils. The research has been carried out using three different clayey soils and four <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> additives. Four different test procedure has been used to evaluate the behavior of the soil conditioned with the different products. The first tests carried out have been the slump test and the vane shear test in order to assess the proper set of conditioning parameter that allows the change of behavior of the clayey soil in a suitable conditioned muck. To evaluate the influence of the different products on the adhesive features of the conditioned soil two specific test have been studied during this research. The results of this research are described and discussed {{at the end of the}} chapter. In the fifth chapter are reported the tests and the results carried on with the aim to verify the possibility to properly treat the muck of a rock TBM in order to apply the EPB technology also in rock masses. This research has been started studying the possible grain size distribution of the much of a EPB TBM with rock tools by the data collected in technical literature. When assessed a range of grain size distribution considered simulative of the TBM muck, a slump test campaign has been performed for each one of the three geological formations studied. The conditioning parameters assessed with the slump test campaign have then been verified with screw conveyor extraction tests performed with the specific experimental test apparatus realized in Politecnico di Torino with very interesting results.

40|$|Plant–soil {{feedback}} (PSF) {{effects on}} plant performance can {{be influenced by}} the availability of nutrients in the soil. Recent studies have shown that PSF effects can also change aboveground plant–insect interactions via soil-mediated changes in plant quality, but whether this is influenced by soil nutrient availability is unknown. We examined how fertilisation influences PSF effects on aboveground plant-aphid interactions in ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris. We grew J. vulgaris in soil conditioned by conspecific plants and in unconditioned soil at two levels of fertilisation and measured soil fungal communities, plant biomass, concentrations of primary (amino acids) and secondary (pyrrolizidine alkaloids; PAs) metabolites in phloem exudates, performance of the specialist aphid Aphis jacobaeae and sequestration of PAs by the aphid. We observed a strong interaction between <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> and fertilisation on amino acid and PA concentrations in phloem exudates of J. vulgaris and on aphid performance, with opposite effects of <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> at the two fertilisation levels. Plant biomass was reduced by <b>soil</b> <b>conditioning</b> and increased by fertilisation. Aphids contained high PA concentrations, converted N-oxides into tertiary amines and preferentially sequestered certain PA compounds, but PA sequestration was not affected by any of the treatments. We conclude that effects of PSF and fertilisation on plant chemistry and aphid performance are interdependent. Our study highlights the need to consider the importance of abiotic soil conditions on the outcome of PSF effects on aboveground plant–insect interactions...|$|E
