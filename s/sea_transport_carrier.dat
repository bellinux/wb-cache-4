40|$|JIP 3 /UNC- 16 /dSYD is a MAPK-scaffolding protein with {{roles in}} protein trafficking. We {{show that it}} is present on the Golgi and is {{necessary}} for the polarized distribution of synaptic vesicle proteins (SVPs) and dendritic proteins in neurons. UNC- 16 excludes Golgi enzymes from SVP <b>transport</b> <b>carriers</b> and facilitates inclusion of specific SVPs into the same <b>transport</b> <b>carrier.</b> The SVP trafficking roles of UNC- 16 are mediated through LRK- 1, whose localization to the Golgi is reduced in unc- 16 animals. UNC- 16, through LRK- 1, also enables Golgi-localization of the μ-subunit of the AP- 1 complex. AP 1 regulates the size but not the composition of SVP <b>transport</b> <b>carriers.</b> Additionally, UNC- 16 and LRK- 1 through the AP- 3 complex regulates the composition but not the size of the SVP <b>transport</b> <b>carrier.</b> These early biogenesis steps are essential for dependence on the synaptic vesicle motor, UNC- 104 for axonal transport. Our results show that UNC- 16 and its downstream effectors, LRK- 1 and the AP complexes function at the Golgi and/or post-Golgi compartments to control early steps of SV biogenesis. The UNC- 16 dependent steps of exclusion, inclusion and motor recruitment are critical for polarized distribution of neuronal cargo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus is {{initiated by the}} collection of secretory cargo from within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, <b>transport</b> <b>carriers</b> are formed that bud from this membrane and are transported to, and subsequently merge with, the Golgi. The principle {{driving force behind the}} budding process is the multi-subunit coat protein complex, COPII. A considerable amount of information is now available regarding the molecular mechanisms by which COPII components operate together to drive cargo selection and <b>transport</b> <b>carrier</b> formation. In contrast, the precise nature of the <b>transport</b> <b>carriers</b> formed is still a matter of considerable debate. Vesicular and tubular carriers have been characterized that are, or in other cases are not, coated with the COPII complex. Here, we seek to integrate much of the data surrounding this topic and try to understand the mechanisms by which vesicular and/or tubular carriers might be generated...|$|R

For international trade, <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> remains the most economical mode of transportation that moves all kinds of goods around the world.

Besides that, this study is going to analyze the economic impacts of the regulatory barriers elimination in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> services of ASEAN and its dialogue partner countries. Using the gravity model, it can be identified that trade barriers of <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> services sector of ASEAN and dialogue partner countries are still relatively high. Additionally, by adopting IC-IRTS model in Global CGE Model (GTAP), the simulation results show consistent results with the theory of pro-competitive effects. The greater gain from trade is obtained in the CGE model assuming IC-IRTS compared to PC-CRTS.

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector. The author examines the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} Marco Polo programme –shift billions of tonnes kilometres from land <b>transport</b> services to <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> services making transport in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of tonnes kilometres which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of <b>sea</b> <b>transport.</b> It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission. The discussion is both analytical as well as speculative. The study ends with conclusions in chapter six...|$|R
