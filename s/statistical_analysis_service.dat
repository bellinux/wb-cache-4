40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have been}} used in {{numerous}} applications to remotely gather real-time data on important environmental parameters. There are several projects where WSNs are deployed in different locations and operate independently. Each deployment has its own models, encodings, and services for sensor data, and are integrated with different types of visualization/analysis tools based on individual project requirements. This makes it difficult to reuse these services for other WSN applications. A user/system is impeded by having to learn the models, encodings, and services of each system, and also must integrate/interoperate data from different data sources. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) provides a set of standards (web service interfaces and data encoding/model specifications) to make sensor data publicly available on the web. This paper describes how the SWE framework can be extended to integrate disparate WSN systems and to support standardized access to sensor data. The proposed system also introduces a web-based data visualization and <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>service</b> for data stored in the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) by integrating open source technologies. A performance analysis is presented to show that the additional features have minimal impact on the system. Also some lessons learned through implementing SWE are discussed. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To provide {{statistician}} {{end users}} {{with a visual}} language environment for complex statistical survey design and implementation. Methods: We have developed, in conjunction with professional statisticians, the Statistical Design Language (SDL), an integrated suite of visual languages aimed at supporting the process of designing statistical surveys, and its support environment, SDLTool. SDL comprises five diagrammatic notations: survey diagrams, data diagrams, technique diagrams, task diagrams and process diagrams. SDLTool provides an integrated environment supporting design, coordination, execution, sharing and publication of complex statistical survey techniques as web services. SDLTool allows association of model components with survey artefacts, including data sets, metadata, and <b>statistical</b> package <b>analysis</b> scripts, {{with the ability to}} execute elements of the survey design model to implement survey analysis. Results: We describe three evaluations of SDL and SDLTool: use of the notation by expert statistician to design and execute surveys; useability evaluation of the environment; and assessment of several generated <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis</b> web <b>services.</b> Conclusion: We have shown the effectiveness of SDLTool for supporting statistical survey design and implementation.

40|$|Health care {{services}} both globally and domestically - are encountering critical issues {{due to the}} increasing demand for services {{at the time of}} economic recession. Hospital performance is subject to many constraints, and planning is made more difficult by the complexity and uncertainty of demand. Population ageing is creating immense pressures on healthcare facilities across the world, leaving them struggling to cope with the growing demand for elderly health{{care services}}. Current demand-supply gaps result in prolonged waiting times for patients and substantial cost burdens for healthcare systems due to delayed discharges. This paper reports on a project that uses modelling and simulation to address elderly care pathways in the Irish healthcare sector. The faster management of frail patients admitted to acute hospitals and the introduction of new intermediate care beds are alternative interventions that healthcare executives are interested in simulating to examine their impact on the performance of the elderly care system. The simulation model developed, along with the <b>statistical</b> <b>analysis,</b> enabled hospital <b>services</b> managers to assess the critical performance and financial issues of the current system, and highlighted the decision variables that could significantly improve the flow of elderly patients...|$|R

METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, a cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 219 transfusion services of the State of Minas Gerais who participated in this investigation by responding to a questionnaire and conducting a proficiency test comprising: ABO and RhD phenotyping, irregular RBC antibody screening and cross-matching.
