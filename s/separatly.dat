When the system is wide so that each edge can be considered <b>separatly,</b> this problem is equivalent {{to that of a}} one dimensional harmonic oscillator centered at x=x_c and an infinite wall at x= 0, and appears in numerous physical contexts. The eigenvalues E_n(x_c) for a given quantum number n are solutions of the equation S(E,x_c) =π [n+ γ(E,x_c) ] where S is the WKB action and 0 <γ< 1 encodes all the information on the connection procedure at the turning points. A careful implication of the WKB connection formulae results in an excellent approximation to the exact energy eigenvalues. The dependence of γ [E_n(x_c),x_c] ≡γ_c (x_c) on x_c is analyzed between its two extreme values 1 / 2 as x_c goes to -infinity far inside the sample and 3 / 4 as x_c goes to infinity far outside the sample. The edge-state energies E_n(x_c) obey an almost exact scaling law of the form E_n(x_c) = 4 [n+γ_n(x_c) ] f(x_c/ 4 n + 3) and the scaling function f(y) is explicitly elucidatedComment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

From the academic year 96 / 97 the teachers of Aplied aestetics, Building Science, Architectural design and CAAD have decided to colaborate as much as possible to make the role of our different fields as clear as possible to the students. Therefore integrating CAAD was a natural step in the academic year 98 / 99.

The use of a VPL carries certain advantages, such as improved dependency tracking and decision transparency for the user. As a VPL is used, we establish an Abstraction Layer Concept (ALC) for hierarchical structuring of HLPs and CMs. The suggested approach provides the basis for next generation infrastructure design and will significantly contribute to a more efficient, cost-saving and high quality planning of infrastructure projects in the future...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the single}} {{objective}} Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) {{the problem is}} usually separated in two sub-problems : the commitment problem which aims to fix the on/off scheduling of each unit and the dispatching problem which goal is to schedule the production of each turned on unit. The dispatching problem is a continuous convex prob-lem that can easily be solved exactly. For the first sub-problem genetic algorithms (GA) are often applied and usually handle binary vectors rep-resenting the solutions of the commitment problem. Then the solutions are decoded in solving the dispatching problem with an exact method to obtain the precise production of each unit. In this paper a multi-objective version of the UCP taking the emission of gas into account is presented. In this multi objective UCP the dispatching problem re-mains easy to solve whereas considering it <b>separatly</b> remains interesting. A multi-objective GA handling binary vectors is applied.

The Project Management (PM) and the Computer Aided Design (CAD) are present in undergraduate and postgraduate programs for architects, but it is common that CADs programs are oriented to the “tools for digital graphics” more than to the processes that the use of CADs tools generates. This approach is the focus of CAD Management (CAD-M). The CAD-M, PM and HR-M, with the leadership common component that content, not always are analyzed with a systemic overview and oftenly the “cuantitative” aspects of the resources are attended over the “cualitative” ones.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to map the {{paradoxical}} limit of the in-between. In its most basic form the thesis is a paradox in itself, for how am I to comprehend and communicate the ever-changing world in a language which is characterised by fixed points and stable relations? The thesis consists of three main parts: a prologue, six chapters and an epilogue. Each of these parts can be read <b>separatly,</b> but togheter they form a set of conceptual maps whose {{focus is on the}} displacements, transpositions, juxtapositions, fluctuations and transformations that fill the gap between delimited categories. In the prologue, Primo Levi's question from Auschwitz – "is this a human being?" – is transposed into the infamous images from Abu Ghraib. The prologue is followed by a section entitled Topoi/graphies, in total six chapters organized into two columns with three chapters in each. In the first pair of chapters we are in the taken-for-granted space of identity thinking, the world of the Euclidian fixed point. In the second pair the taken-for-granted universe of the fixed point has all but evaporated and we are instead witnessing how relations are being stabilized. In the third pair there is the horror of neither fixed points nor relations. Rephrased, the six chapters enact a journey that starts within a fixed spatiality in which human thought-and-action is anchored in the given of identity. It then moves through a social world in which the spatio-temporal transformations are neither fixed nor taken-for-granted. Finally it edges into a pure temporality that lies beyond the maps of fixed points and social relations. It is in its own topic that the thesis cannot come to a definite conclusion. The epilogue nevertheless reaches out for a conceptual synthesis – nine minimalist figures with accompanying texts...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{contains}} a colloidal particle, called the casein micelle (CAS) and globular proteins, called whey proteins. If a whey protein solution is heated, heat-induced whey proteins denature and form colloidal aggregates, called whey protein aggregates (WPA). These compounds {{are present in}} milk when it is heated, as for the manufacture of yoghurts. Indeed, CAS and WPA form particular gels by acidification, either in mixture or even <b>separatly.</b> The aim of this aim was {{to understand how the}} gel formed from these 2 colloids. The CAS and WPA were dispersed in a milk permeate at different protein concentrations ranging from ~ 15 to ~ 105 g kg- 1 separately and in a mixture at 80 / 20 on a weight ratio, respectively and as in milk. Acidification was performed at 35 °C by addition of glucono- -lactone to achieve a final pH at ~ 4. 5 in 6 h. Acid gelation was studied by rheology, namely by small amplitude oscillation, followed by large deformation measurement at pH 4. 5. Viscoelastic moduli versus time or pH were compared for the different systems at different concentrations, while the microstructure of the gels at their final pH value was studied by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Results show that increasing the protein concentration for the 3 systems promoted a faster gelation, led to higher moduli and to gels with smaller pore sizes, which is due to {{the increase in the number}} of particles and consequently probably in the number of potential bonds between them and to the reduction in the distances between colloids. Replacing 20 % of CAS by WPA increased the moduli of the acid gels as long as the protein concentrations was 2. 6, and probably built under a reaction-limited mechanism. The WPA gel was of the strong-link regime, with lower Df value around 1. 7 and produced by a diffusion-limited mechanism. We suspect that these differences were possibly due to the different surface interactive properties of these 2 colloids, together with their different internal structure that lead to a different mechanism of acid gelation...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are increasingly penetrating new range of applications, from industry controllers, to houshold appliances. The wireless standard, IEEE 802. 15. 4 /ZigBee, combines simple operation with low power consumption. This type of network is increasingly utilized {{as a mechanism}} to monitor, survey, sense and track. This thesis presents a multi-domain device registration and authentication model built on key pre-distribution mechanisms in order to enable nodes from different operational managements to interact. Little {{research has been done}} in the area of inter-domain communication in sensor networks. Even so, this may be an important feature to sensor networks which can open up for new services. Two novel suggestions for a multi-domain model are presented; hierarchical inter-domain random pool (HIDRP), and interactive inter-domain random pool (IIDRP). The HIDRP scheme relies on a single global key-pool containing all keys which will be used by sub-domains, thereby acting as the equivalent of a root CA. The IIDRP scheme on the other hand, {{is based on the assumption}} of domains containing keys derived <b>separatly</b> without correlation. Devices from foreign domains will accordingly have no common key-material to which key-establishment can successfully be acomplished. Sharing common keying material happens by the exchange of keys between the coordinator nodes in each domain. The nodes will then be able to derive a shared secret key to enable authentication. Since there are no protocols for inter-domain communication in the ZigBee protocol, the first step will be to provide architectural changes that will enable this function. Furthermore, a procedure to share network keys or link-keys for devices in different domains will have to be designed. In the HIDRP scheme, the numerical analysis was performed to evaluate the key connectivity in relation to the size of keys involved in the distribution. The analysis showed that as the global key pool size increased, the link connectivity decreased. Furthermore, no correlation was shown between key connectivity and the size of the local key pool. Only the size of the global key pool and the key ring affected the link connectivity. In the IIDRP scheme, numerical simulation was performed in order to measure the round-trip-time (RTT) for link-key aquisition in a foreign domain.

It seems highly probable that this fact is common for all digenetic trematodes. 2) In Loxogenes liberum, Stellantchasmus falcatus, Echinochasmus perfoliatus, E. japonicus, E. elongatus and Echinostoma gotoi, the “Befruchtungsraum (Looss) ” [“Verschluckapparat (Kobayashi) ”] developes prominently, while in the other 12 specieses rudimentary. 3) In Stamnosoma armatum, Pygidiopsis summus, Exorchis oviformis and a new species of Exorchis (Exorchis major Hasegawa) the direction of the ciliary movement of the cilia of the Laurer's canal is constantly centripetal (towards the oviduct), while in the other 14 specieses on the contrary constantly centrifugal (towards the dorsal opening of the Laurer's canal.) 4) In all specimens examined, the Laurer's canal opens on the dorsal surface of the body and it seems to eliminate the contents of the seminal receptacle and the oviduct. 5) In Loxogenes liberum and Genarchopsis goppo, a group of especially long cilia is recognizable in the orifice of the seminal receptacle, by its ciliary movement the contents of the latter are constantly stired. 6) In Stamnosoma armatum, the contents of the seminal receptacle are arranged like a whirl. 7) About the relation of the Laurer's canal with the seminal receptacle recognized the author following four types: a) The seminal receptacle itself does not open <b>separatly</b> in the oviduct but is merely a dilated part of the Laurer's canal near its junction with the oviduct. (for example: A new species of Podocotyle and Genarchopsis goppo). b) The seminal receptacle is connected to the Laurer's canal near its junction with the oviduct by a short duct. (for example: Clonorchis sinensis). c) The seminal receptacle and Laurer's canal open together into the oviduct by one orifice. (for example; Stamnosoma armatum and Loxogenes liberum). d) The seminal receptacle and Laurer's canal open separately but very closely into the oviduct. (for example: Metorchis orientalis). 8) In Stellantchasmus falcatus Echinochasmus perfoliatus, E. japonicus, E. elongatus and Echinostoma gotoi, there is no true seminal receptacle...|$|E
40|$|I {{evaluated}} the medical reports and scrotal mri-examinations of 128 patients. The intrascrotal findings {{of these patients}} were classified as seminomas (18), non-seminomas (14), hematomas (29), inflammatory changes (22), ectopic testicles (5) and normal findings in MRI (8). Scrotal findings that not be classified into these groups were summarized {{in the group of}} mixed results (32). Seminomas were found more frequent in significantly higher rates in-histologically atrophic testicles, in the group of non-seminomas was a significantly accumulation the histologically intratumoral bleeding. There was seldom a correlation from intratumoral bleeding and necroses with the signal intensity of the seminomas and nonseminomas. The native sequences are not suitable to differentiate between seminomas and nonseminomas because of a similar mr-signal-pattern. A distinction between seminomas and nonseminomas is possible by the consideration of morphology and for contrast medium behaviors. It is a seminoma with a great probability if the tumor is not round, limited blurredly, does not show any hypointense pseudocapsule in the T 2 -sequence and enriches after the contrast medium centrally homogeneously, in addition septa- and ringlikely and in the first contrast study more strongly than in a second. It is a nonseminoma with a great probability if the tumor is round, surrounded by a hypointense pseudocapsule in the T 2 -sequence, the contrast medium is without septa- and ringlikely structures and the contrast enhancement is not stronger in the first one of two studies. In addition to tumoral changes I examined typical MR-appearances of 44 hematomas were looked at by 29 patients. The signal intensity and the contrastenhancement from the periphery and center of the hematomas were looked <b>separatly</b> and also its dependence from the age. There was found no dependence of the central and peripheral signal intensity in the T 1 -sequence, of the central signal intensity in the T 2 -sequence and of the contrast medium behavior of the hemtoma age. Hematoma with strong hypointense periphery in the T 2 -sequence and similarly relatively homogeous signal behavior in both sequences were older than these without these features. Rare cases like an intrascrotal acute myeloic leukemia, a granulosa cell tumor (child 1 d old), a presumably testicular melanoic metastasis and unclear bilateral scrotal lipomatous changes was discribed casuistically. No significant connections between benign or malign scrotal entities and hydroceles were found. Non-seminoma was more offen seen in connection with varicoceles. Benign results offen showed an ipsilateral edema of scrotal wall and/or spermatic cord connected with a corresponding contrast medium enrichment in with particularly inflammable changes in the foreground stood here...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was by means of {{qualitative}} methods to explore the meaning of EASW for young women with self-harm problems in residential treat- ment. Seen from the eyes of the clients and the staff members, what role and meaning is devoted to the hor- se as used in EASW? How does the interaction with the horse contribute to the clients and staff ́s perception of autenticity and the possibilities to be in an authentic relation?  Definition EASW represents an alternative or a supplement to conventional treatment and social work, and involves a triangular relationship between staff, client and the horse. The activities in EASW can involve care of the horse, training with the horse, riding, carriage driving and vaulting (gymnastics on horseback). The program will always depend on the staff ’s skills and educational background, the horse ́s abilities as well as the client ́s skills and wishes.   Method Data were initially collected by in-depht interviews with 8 staff members and 9 clients. In-depth interviews that lasted between 40 - 60 minutes based on 6 - 7 themes were conducted <b>separatly</b> with the clients and the staff mem- bers Observations of the human-horse interaction were videotaped and conducted three times with each pair of staff and client that worked together in EASW. After the observations indepht interviews were conducted with clients and staffmembers in direct conjunction with one of the observations.   Results Based on the narratives of the staff members and the clients; it seemed that the horse’s ability to read human emotions made the staff and clients aware of their emotions. In order not to alienate the horse or make the situation dangerous, the clients and staff said that they had to regulate their emotions, which intensified their sense of being in the moment. The participants felt the horse read their intentions, and gave them a direct feedback on their ex- pressed emotions. Furthermore, this feedback was given to them in a way that did not raise their defence mechanisms. The horse seemed to function as an emotional mirror for the participants. They detected and recognized their own emotions, and subsequently had to regulate them in order to interact with the horse and others in a positive way. Finally the horse seemed to set the framework for the interaction between the staff-members and the young women, which became more informal and dynamic. Stable-based relations- hips experienced as based on trust, respect and negotiation can accordingly be interpreted as being representing as more authentic relationships compared to relationships outside of the stable.   Implications for clinical work The clients found it easier to bond with the horse because it was not ha- ving expectations of the clients. The staff members, however, could be expe- rienced as if they had expectations of clients. The client perceives the horse as nojudgemental, honest, reliable, have no prejudices, offer physical contact and give direct feedback. The stable provided other opportunities for interac- tion than the therapy room, as other rules apply and staff and clients became more equal and perceived their relations as more ”authentic”. The horse was a door opener for the clients to get rid of anxiety and agression resulting in calmness and relaxation. This open up for communication between staff and client, which in turn could increase new insights. ...|$|E
