She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E

2500|$|Alice Braga as Woman with Dark Glasses. Braga {{described}} her character as mysterious, believing, [...] "While she does sleep with men {{because it is}} easy money, I {{did not want to}} treat her purely as a prostitute. She starts out quite tough, but <b>she</b> <b>develops</b> very strong maternal feelings."

5|$|Anne's early {{education}} was typical {{for women of}} her class. In 1513, Anne was {{invited to join the}} schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. <b>She</b> <b>developed</b> domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework, and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess, and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E

5|$|Her {{achievements}} {{included the}} development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E
5|$|In Pezuelas Lebrón {{began her}} {{education}} in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water, as a consequence she grew with a frail body {{and was unable to}} keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. <b>She</b> <b>developed</b> an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.|$|E

It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a collapsed lung and required hospitalization. Her wider health was poor, as she suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, <b>she</b> <b>developed</b> a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
