5|$|By 1934, the {{executive}} branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to the}} constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were often the constitutional officers themselves. Governor Ruby Laffoon proposed the Administrative Reorganization Act of 1934 to organize these boards and commissions into seventeen executive departments and seven independent agencies. The General Assembly passed this legislation, giving {{the executive}} branch some semblance of <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Snakedance, Saward {{requested that}} writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 {{and was about}} the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and a tangible villain for the Doctor to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.|$|E

In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E

A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

5|$|Funded by a Derelict Land Grant, the {{engineering}} consultants Binnies {{carried out a}} feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures of the canal, campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding {{for the restoration of}} the warehouse and the former offices of the canal company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal.

5|$|In 1925, {{while the}} Roeriches {{were engaged in}} a long period of travel in Central Asia, Horch began to acquire the lots {{surrounding}} the mansion to construct the Master Building. The Roeriches' extensive travels were almost entirely funded by Louis Horch. As is common when assembling adjacent lots for a single purpose, he used dummies as purchasers. In doing this he followed a pattern he had established in providing an organizational <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Master Institute when he installed the Roeriches and their close associates as nominal shareholders and corporate officers.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1939 the Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} {{the formation of}} a RAAF Expeditionary Force for overseas service which would have included a wing designated No. 1 Fighter Wing as well as two wings of bombers.

This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the Expeditionary Force would not proceed, with the Empire Air Training Scheme instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.|$|E

5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} {{the plan of}} attack and command <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb {{in preparation for a}} regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's air defenses.|$|E
5|$|Some Mauritanian {{dolphins}} {{cooperate with}} human fishermen. The dolphins drive {{a school of}} fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch {{a large number of}} fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, Sturdee {{took the}} {{surrender}} of Japanese forces in the Rabaul area. As one of the Army's most senior officers, he succeeded General Sir Thomas Blamey as Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces in December 1945. He became the Chief of the General Staff a second time in 1946, serving in the post {{until his retirement in}} 1950. During this term, he had to demobilise the wartime Army while fielding and supporting the Australian contingent of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. He developed a <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-war Army that included regular combat formations. As a result, the Australian Regular Army was formed, laying the foundations for the service as it exists today.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords. Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard <b>structure</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the General Staff. On that basis, the existing Partisan units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E
