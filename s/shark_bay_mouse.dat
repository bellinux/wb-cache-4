50|$|There is some {{speculation}} that this species {{was in fact}} an eastern population of the <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mouse</b> (Pseudomys fieldi). Once the Alice Springs mouse {{was thought to be}} extinct but with genetic testing in 1998 scientists confirmed that the Alice Springs mouse was also the <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mouse,</b> and this could also one day happen between Gould's mouse and the <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mouse.</b>|$|E

50|$|Invasive feral {{cats and}} black rats have been {{eradicated}} from the islands, allowing endangered rufous hare-wallabies and <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mice</b> to be translocated {{to the islands}} under the conservation management strategy for these threatened species.

40|$|The Montebello {{archipelago}} {{consists of}} 218 islands; 80 km from the north-west coast of Western Australia. Before 1912 the islands had a diverse terrestrial fauna. By 1952 several species were locally extinct. Between 1996 and 2011 rodents and cats were eradicated, and 5 mammal and 2 bird species were translocated to the islands. Monitoring {{of the broader}} terrestrial ecosystem over time has been limited. We used 20 dry-season Landsat images from 1988 to 2013 and estimation of green fraction cover in nadir photographs taken at 27 sites within the Montebello islands and six sites on Thevenard Island to assess change in vegetation density over time. Analysis of data averaged across the 26 -year period suggests that 719 ha out of 2169 ha have increased in vegetation cover by up to 32 %, 955 ha have remained stable and 0. 6 ha have declined in vegetation cover. Over 492 ha (22 %) had no vegetation cover {{at any time during}} the period analysed. Chronological clustering analysis identified two breakpoints in the average vegetation cover data occurring in 1997 and 2003, near the beginning and end of the rodent eradication activities. On many islands vegetation cover was declining prior to 1996 but increased after rodents were eradicated from the islands. Data for North West and Trimouille islands were analysed independently because of the potential confounding effect of native fauna being introduced to these islands. Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mice</b> (Pseudomys fieldi) both appear to suppress native plant recruitment but not to the same degree as introduced rodents. Future research should assess whether the increase in vegetation cover on the Montebello islands is due to an increase in native or introduced plants...|$|R

50|$|<b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mouse</b> (Pseudomys fieldi) {{also known}} as djoongari, prior to 1993 the only known {{population}} of djoongari was on Bernier Island in the north-west of Western Australia, adjacent to the Shark Bay region and {{was considered to be}} one of Australia's most geographically restricted animals. Over 300 Perth-Zoo-bred djoongari have been released to sites on the mainland and on islands in the north-west of Western Australia. This breeding program is now complete.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>mouse,</b> Djoongari or Alice Springs mouse (Pseudomys fieldi) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae. It is found only in Australia, {{restricted}} to four islands in the Shark Bay area. It was once found throughout the western two thirds of Australia but it suffered greatly after the arrival of Europeans and feral animals. Its range was reduced to coastal sand dunes on Bernier Island, leaving it severely endangered. In 2003 the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) released some Shark Bay mice onto Faure Island {{in the hope of}} creating another population. Despite the presence of owls the reintroduction was successful and the population quickly grew to a larger size than that of Bernier Island, no longer leaving the species on the brink of extinction.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> is {{believed}} to be home to more than 10 % of the world’s dugongs, (Dugong dugon), (Marsh et al., 2002; Gales et al., 2004), and the importance of <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> as a significant habitat for dugongs {{was one of the reasons}} for its World Heritage listing. <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> arguably offers the best opportunity to conserve dugongs in the world because it: a) is isolated from urban development; b) has a low level of Indigenous hunting and c) occurs within a Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The four systematic surveys of <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> conducted to date suggest that the population is consistently above 10, 000 dugongs. Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf also support significant dugong populations that are to be interconnected with <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay.</b> The last survey conducted in the <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> / Ningaloo / Exmouth region showed a dramatic decline in dugong abundance in association with a significant increase in <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay,</b> suggesting that dugongs had moved southward following the loss of seagrass during a cyclone event in the northern region. This finding was evidence of a link between the <b>Shark</b> <b>Bay</b> and Ningaloo-Exmouth dugong populations, which therefore, cannot be managed in isolation. Aims of this projec...|$|R
