The Red Ensign! In the pellucid, colourless atmosphere bathing the drab and grey masses of that southern land, the livid islets, the sea of pale glassy blue under the pale glassy sky of that cold sunrise, it was as far as the eye could reach the only spot of ardent colour--flame-like, intense, and presently as minute as the tiny red spark the concentrated reflection of a great fire kindles in the clear heart of a globe of crystal.

60|$|This is {{very sad}} and chilling. It seemed quite {{otherwise}} in New York, where Canada was {{represented as a}} ripe plum ready to fell into Uncle Sam's mouth when he should open it.

When we woke it was on the banks of the muddy Fraser River and the spring was hurrying to meet us. The snow had gone; the pink blossoms of the wild currant were open, the budding alders stood misty green against the blue black of the pines, the brambles on the burnt stumps were in tenderest leaf, and every moss on every stone was this year's work, fresh from the hand of the Maker. The land opened into clearings of soft black earth. At one station a hen had laid an egg and was telling the world about it. The world answered with a breath of real spring--spring that flooded the stuffy car and drove us out on the platform to snuff and sing and rejoice and pluck <b>squashy</b> green marsh-flags and throw them at the colts, and shout at the wild duck that rose from a jewel-green lakelet. God be thanked that in travel one can follow the year! This, my spring, I lost last November in New Zealand. Now I shall hold her fast through Japan and the summer into New Zealand again.|$|E

60|$|My dear Tom--I cannot make my Journal as {{distinct}} and actual as I could wish, from having {{been engaged in}} writing to George, and therefore I must tell you without circumstance that we proceeded from Ambleside to Rydal, saw the Waterfalls there, and called on Wordsworth, who was not at home, nor was any one of his family. I wrote a note and left it on the mantel-piece. Thence on {{we came to the}} foot of Helvellyn, where we slept, but could not ascend it for the mist. I must mention that from Rydal we passed Thirlswater, and a fine pass in the Mountains--from Helvellyn we came to Keswick on Derwent Water. The approach to Derwent Water surpassed Windermere--it is richly wooded, and shut in with rich-toned Mountains. From Helvellyn to Keswick was eight miles to Breakfast, after which we took a complete circuit of the Lake, going about ten miles, and seeing on our way the Fall of Lowdore. I had an easy climb among the streams, about the fragments of Rocks and should have got I think to the summit, but unfortunately I was damped by slipping one leg into a <b>squashy</b> hole. There is no great body of water, but the accompaniment is delightful; for it oozes out from a cleft in perpendicular Rocks, all fledged with Ash and other beautiful trees.[69] It is a strange thing how they got there. At {{the south end of the}} Lake, the Mountains of Borrowdale are perhaps as fine as anything we have seen. On our return from this circuit, we ordered dinner, and set forth about a mile and a half on the Penrith road, to see the Druid temple. We had a fag up hill, rather too near dinner-time, which was rendered void by the gratification of seeing those aged stones on a gentle rise in the midst of the Mountains, which at that time darkened all around, except at the fresh opening of the Vale of St. John. We went to bed rather fatigued, but not so much so as to hinder us getting up this morning to mount Skiddaw. It promised all along to be fair, and we had fagged and tugged nearly to the top, when, at half-past six, there came a Mist upon us and shut out the view. We did not, however, lose anything by it: we were high enough without mist to see the coast of Scotland--the Irish Sea--the hills beyond Lancaster--and nearly all the large ones of Cumberland and Westmoreland, particularly Helvellyn and Scawfell. It grew colder and colder as we ascended, and we were glad, at about three parts of the way, to taste a little rum which the Guide brought with him, mixed, mind ye, with Mountain water. I took two glasses going and one returning. It is about six miles from where I am writing to the top--So we have walked ten miles before Breakfast to-day. We went up with two others, very good sort of fellows--All felt, on arising into the cold air, that same elevation which a cold bath gives one--I felt as if I were going to a Tournament.|$|E

50|$|Spells are the every-purpose {{tools of}} a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to {{accomplish}} single specialised {{tasks such as}} opening locks or creating fire. Typically casting requires an incantation, most often in a modified form of Latin (see Dog Latin), and gesturing with a wand. However, Rowling has revealed that particularly talented wizards can cast spells {{without the aid of}} wand, although magic produced with one is generally more precise and powerful. Spells can also be cast non-verbally, but with a magical wand. This special technique is taught in the sixth year of study at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation. Some spells (e.g. Levicorpus) are apparently designed to be used non-verbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their voice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as conjuring enough <b>squashy</b> purple sleeping bags to accommodate the entire student population or during his duel with Voldemort towards the end of Order of the Phoenix.|$|E

40|$|Well, in Paris {{they have}} the Eiffel Tower, in New York {{they have the}} Statue of Liberty and in London they have Big Ben … but Waterford has {{something}} {{that none of these}} cities have – Waterford has a <b>Squashy</b> Couch (that’s our youth café!). This toolkit has been developed to help guide YOU in starting up YOUR OWN youth café. So, we were thinking about why we go to <b>Squashy</b> Couch and why would anyone go to a youth café. First of all, it’s a break between school and home, and to be honest it’s a break from school and home. It’s safe and healthy, a secure environment where you get to meet people from other schools. You can pan out and relax, watch telly, do whatever, it’s friendly so you don’t have to worry. Then it’s a place where you’re not judged, there’s nobody looking at you and saying stuff about ‘the youth today’, and the staff look after you, you don’t get shunned or anything. You can have a proper conversation with the staff and they’ll help you if you want information about anything. In our café, the information around the walls is great. There’s stuff about your own life and about things you can do. If you have a question, you can read the stuff on the walls and find out {{what you need to know}} and then the staff will help you if you need to go further. We don’t know what we’d do without <b>Squashy.</b> We’ve spent our youth here. The stuff we do on Friday nights is fun and brilliant: we’ve had band competitions, theme nights, Indian nights, American nights, movie nights, art clubs and that. It’s in town and easy to get to. There’s always something to do and someone to talk to. So, YOUR café might be anything from a support for when things aren’t so great to being a place to go and just sit and hang out with friends – and everything in between. The best part is that the young people get to make some decisions about where it is, what it looks like and how it’s organised. Remember, GREAT youth cafés are flexible, so everyone can have a say. What we hoped to achieve when we were setting up our café was a place where young people wanted to go, could have their say, create a ‘home from home’ and a place where being yourself is the ‘norm’...|$|E
