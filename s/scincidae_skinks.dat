40|$|We {{examined}} the species richness and distribution patterns of reptiles inhabiting the Central Western Ghats Moun-tains of southwestern India. In {{the past few}} years, field work by us {{as well as our}} colleagues resulted in a steady stream of several new regional records of species of day geckos (Cnemaspis), <b>skinks</b> (<b>Scincidae),</b> shieldtail snakes (Uropeltidae), bronzeback tree snakes (Dendrelaphis) and coral snakes (Calliophis). Based on our past extensive sampling in the region as a whole and intensive, long-term sampling in the central part, i. e., the Agumbe plateau, we continue to add several additional species of geckos (Gekkonidae), agamids (Calotes), skinks and snakes in this paper. We take a more holistic approach here and revise the checklist of reptiles inhabiting the Central Western Ghats not only by adding all our past and present new regional records but also by deleting some dubious “re-cords ” of agamids (Salea) and pitvipers (Trimeresurus) not based on voucher specimens pending the availability of reliable, soundly identified vouchers. As a result, a total of 71 species of reptiles, comprising of 4 chelonians, 24 lizards and 43 snakes are reported here. Our literature review shows that only 11 (out of 71) species were origi-nally described from this region. Our preliminary analysis of area cladogram delineated that despite the many range extensions of “southern ” Western Ghats species, the Central Western Ghats reptile fauna is still more similar to the Northern Western Ghats. Our analysis of distribution patterns revealed that half the species are Western Ghats endemics (47 %), many are also widespread species (30 %) and that the Eastern Ghats and Sri Lankan fauna were only scarcely represented...|$|R

A provisional diagnosis of rickettsial illness was made at transfer of the patient to our medical center, and oral doxy-cycline administered at an initial dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg twice per day for 1 week was prescribed. Rapid plasma reagin tests and blood cultures had negative results. Results of serial rickettsial serological testing demonstrated a striking in-crease in antibody titer to R. honei (table 1). Rickettsial PCR and culture performed at the Australian Rickettsial Reference Laboratory (Geelong, Australia) on a blood specimen collected at day 14 of illness (before specific treatment was initiated) had negative results. A number of new spotted fever group rickettsiae {{have been identified in}} the past 3 decades. Infection due to R. honei in Australia was first described among residents of Flinders Island in Bass Strait (separating mainland Australia from Tasmania) 15 years ago [1], but in the last 3 years, this infection has also been recognized in southern mainland Australia [2, 3]. The evidence suggests that the principal vector of R. honei infection is the parasitic tick Aponomma hydrosauri, which has a variety of reptile hosts, including members of the <b>skink</b> (<b>Scincidae)</b> family (of which “blue-tongue lizards ” are a member) [4]. The clinical illness is generally characteristic, with fever, myalgias, headaches, and rash. The rash may vary in nature, and the palms and soles are variably involved (figure 1). Eschars and regional lymphadenopathy are inconsistently found. Definitiv...|$|R
60|$|Reptiles and Amphibia of the Seychelles.--The {{reptiles}} and amphibia {{are rather}} numerous and very interesting, indicating {{clearly that the}} islands can hardly be classed as oceanic. There are seven species of lizards, three being peculiar to the islands, while the others have rather a wide range. The first is a chameleon--defenceless {431} slow-moving lizards, especially abundant in Madagascar, from which no less than eighteen species are now known, {{about the same number}} as on the continent of Africa. The Seychelles species (Chamæleon tigris) also occurs at Zanzibar. The next are <b>skinks</b> (<b>Scincidæ),</b> small ground-lizards with a wide distribution in the Eastern hemisphere. Two species are however peculiar to the islands--Mabuia seychellensis and M. wrightii. The other peculiar species is one of the geckoes (Geckotidæ) named Æluronyx seychellensis, and there are also three other geckoes, Phelsuma madagascarensis, Gehyra mutilata and Hemidactylus frenatus, the two latter having a wide distribution in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. These lizards, clinging as they do to trees and timber, are exceedingly liable to be carried in ships from one country to another, and I am told by Dr. Günther that some are found almost every year in the London Docks. It is therefore probable, that when species of this family have a very wide range they have been assisted in their migrations by man, though their habit of clinging to trees also renders them likely to be floated with large pieces of timber to considerable distances. Dr. Percival Wright, to whom I am indebted for much information on the productions of the Seychelles Archipelago, informs me that the last-named species varies greatly in colour in the different islands, so that he could always tell from which particular island a specimen had been brought. This is analogous to the curious fact of certain lizards on the small islands in the Mediterranean being always very different in colour from those of the mainland, usually becoming rich blue or black (see Nature, Vol. XIX. p. 97); and we thus learn how readily in some cases differences of colour are brought about, either directly or indirectly, by local conditions.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the prevalence and {{spatial distribution of}} Salmonella serovars amongst wild endemic lizards on offshore islands around the coast of New Zealand. The mean test prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella was 4. 7 %. <b>Skinks</b> (<b>Scincidae)</b> were more likely (8. 5 %) to be carriers of Salmonella than geckos (1. 6 %). Each island was host to between one and three Salmonella serovars that were not found on any other islands in this study. Two exceptions were Salmonella Bousso and Salmonella Mana which were found on two islands within the same geographical area. Based {{on the findings of}} this study, different islands are likely to be hosts to different Salmonella serovars which could have implications for future translocations of native lizards. I also assessed the prevalence and spatial distribution of faecal excretion of Salmonella, Aeromonas and Hafnia alvei within Mana Island. The prevalence of Salmonella on Mana Island was estimated at 5. 8 %. Salmonella was found predominantly in skinks (10. 0 %) and less often in geckos (4. 1 %). H. alvei was found at a prevalence of 1. 9 %. No Aeromonas species were cultured from any of the cloacal swabs, suggesting that the 95 % confidence interval for the true prevalence is 0 - 3 %. Each site sampled in this study was host to one or more unique serovar of Salmonella not found at any of the other sites. The results {{of this study indicate that}} Salmonella serovars may become established within populations of lizards and is not spread between them. This may be due to a lack of dispersal of lizards between sites, raising important considerations for the translocation of native lizards. I investigated the prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella, H. alvei and Aeromonas by New Zealand native lizards from two captive populations. The mean prevalence of faecal excretion of Salmonella in the captive lizards sampled was 11. 5 %. There was a higher prevalence of Salmonella within captive population A (22. 0 %) than in population B (3. 6 %). No Aeromonas was cultured from any of the lizards. H. alvei was found at a prevalence of 5. 2 %. The prevalence of Salmonella and H. alvei was significantly higher in captive lizards than in wild populations. Captive lizards may, therefore, not be appropriate founders for new populations of wild lizards. Finally I assessed the different efficiencies of two media and two temperatures in isolating six Salmonella serovars from a reptilian source. All serovars grew equally well at 37 °C and 27 °C. For most serovars XLD agar was the more successful media than MacConkey agar but the success of different culture media depended on the serovar being cultured. Because lizards are frequently host to a wide range of Salmonella serovars, screening samples using multiple microbiological methods is likely to give the best chance of isolating all Salmonella serovars present...|$|R
