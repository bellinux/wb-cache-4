40|$|In the landscape, {{if there}} is to be any {{prospect}} of scientific prediction, it is crucial that there be <b>states</b> <b>which</b> are distinguished in some way. The obvious candidates are <b>states</b> <b>which</b> exhibit symmetries. Here we focus on <b>states</b> <b>which</b> exhibit discrete symmetries. Such states are rare, but one can speculate that they are cosmological attractors. We investigate the problem in model landscapes and cosmologies which capture some of the features of candidate flux landscapes. In non-supersymmetric theories we find no evidence that such states might be cosmologically favored. In supersymmetric theories, simple arguments suggest that <b>states</b> <b>which</b> exhibit $R$ symmetries might be.

5|$|Following {{the last}} week of {{regularly}} scheduled conference games, both teams moved up in the national college football polls. Florida <b>State,</b> <b>which</b> had been ranked No.22 in the BCS Poll, No.22 in the AP Poll, and No.21 in the Coaches' Poll, rose to No.21 in the BCS, No.20 in the AP Poll, and No.20 in the Coaches' Poll. Virginia Tech, which had been ranked 16th in the BCS, 13th in the AP Poll and 14th in the Coaches' Poll before the final week of the regular season, climbed to 15th in the BCS, 11th in the AP Poll and 11th in the Coaches' Poll. Spread bettors predicted Virginia Tech would win the game. Various betting organizations favored the Hokies by four or 4.5points. The matchup was a repeat of the inaugural ACC Championship game, and according to observers, the Seminoles' presence appeared to mark a resurgence for Florida <b>State,</b> <b>which</b> performed below expectations in the final years of Bowden's tenure. For Virginia Tech, there were hopes of breaking a trend of losing to Florida State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was 1–8 against Florida State, and the Hokies overall were 11–22–1 against the Seminoles.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground <b>state,</b> <b>which</b> are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited <b>state,</b> <b>which</b> behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
