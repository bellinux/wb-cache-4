500|$|She {{followed}} her same [...] "writing ritual" [...] {{that she had}} followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry: she rented a hotel room, closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme [...] "America", she wrote down everything <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> about the country, which she then [...] "pushed and squeezed into a poetic form". Angelou recited the poem on January 20, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Taylforth {{said that}} she wished that Kathy could {{come back from the}} dead and that {{it was a mistake to}} kill her off. Earlier that year {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer revealed that he would like to have brought back Kathy from the dead but vowed not to revive deceased characters. Taylforth reiterated her desire to return to EastEnders in 2013 and that she heard a writer in 2011 saying that producers wanted her to return and asked her if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a way to bring Kathy back. She revealed that producer John Yorke told her that killing off Kathy was [...] "one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made", and the writer who had decided to kill off Kathy regretted it afterwards, though said it was a [...] "good idea at the time". EastEnders spokespeople stated there were currently no plans for Taylforth to return and that some of the producers who had said they wanted Kathy to return had since left. [...] In 2014, Taylforth revealed that she doubts whether Kathy is really dead and said that many EastEnders viewers have written with proposed storylines on how she could make a return to the show.|$|E

60|$|She did not answer. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her appalling shame.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Madame Déroulède or of Anne Mie {{without the}} most agonising, the most torturing shame.|$|R
60|$|But now! How was she {{to think}} about all this now? And {{thinking}} of these things, how {{was it possible that}} she should have heart left to feel for the miseries of Lady Fitzgerald? With all her miseries would not Lady Fitzgerald still be more fortunate than she? Let come what might, Lady Fitzgerald had had a life of prosperity and love. No; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Lady Fitzgerald, nor <b>of</b> Herbert: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Owen Fitzgerald, of her daughter, and of herself.|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. She {{asked me}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} now but her dear father. She stifled a sob--[he breaks down].|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} be Mr. Fotheringham, the only poet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and she could only beg to be told.|$|E
6000|$|Now Rosina {{generally}} had {{her answer}} ready, and I am very {{sorry to say}} that she did not always speak the truth when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything better. On this occasion she was anxious to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom. But Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal kindness, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing but to curtsy, and say: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{extraordinary}} {{how cold}} she looked. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any appropriate gesture. There can {{have been few}} precedents indeed for such a situation.|$|R
60|$|But {{the girl}} felt no {{softening}} of the heart; that strange fire was still burning in her, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the cruel words, the unjust blow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have misjudged her," [...] he said. [...] "Doubtless while my fa- -, while Adam Dishart lived, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you with pain; but after his death--" ...|$|R
60|$|Rachel was a {{good deal}} stung by his banter, which she felt to be {{directed}} equally against them both, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no repartee.|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} a writing-table and went away, while the first letters so amazed Geraldine that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing else, and hastened to summon Clement.|$|E
60|$|She had {{finished}} all the preparations <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> She sat and waited. She {{listened for the}} door-bell, the telephone. Her eagerness was stilled. Her hands drooped.|$|E
60|$|Elinor {{would not}} oppose his opinion, because, {{whatever}} might be her general {{estimation of the}} advantage of a public school, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Feemy gave a long, {{long sigh}} as {{she heard the}} word. She wished for no message from her brother; he had robbed her <b>of</b> everything; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him without horror and shuddering.|$|R
60|$|As Mara {{watched his}} {{demeanor}} with Moses, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> only <b>of</b> a loathsome black snake {{that she had}} once seen in those solitary rocks;--she felt as if his handsome but evil eye were charming him with an evil charm to his destruction.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Dorcas was not {{satisfied}} with this arrangement; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing better just then, and appeared determined {{there should be no}} further discussion on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing better: {{and though}} there was {{something}} in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet? ...|$|E
60|$|If she {{had come}} back within the next minute, she would have found him still looking up. She felt quite sure of this, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no good reason for another reappearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{endeavor}} to be good," [...] she said, and then flushed with annoyance at the adjective. Half-dazed {{by the cold}} as <b>she</b> was, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a more suitable one. Winston, however, retained his gravity.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{thought the}} whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave {{that she did not}} dare to laugh; and, as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> another word, not one, and {{she fell}} into a horrible silence, {{wringing}} her hands piteously. It was {{impossible for her to}} go on, and impossible for her to leave the floor till the word of release came.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{remembered how}} little {{she had done}} so; but she desired to protect Mrs. Beale too. The only {{protection}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> however, was the plea: [...] "Oh at papa's, you know, they don't mind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a good colour," [...] {{said the}} friend, looking {{critically}} at the supposed kitten, {{who was sitting}} up on his haunches combing his whiskers, and saying the only truthfully pleasant thing about him that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{her wish}} had been gratified, {{when she had}} read it from {{beginning}} to end, one vivid impression only was left on her mind. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing but what the judge had said, in speaking of Mrs. Linley.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{was pale}} with horror when Josie {{finished}} her earnest and convincing statement. She regarded her friend's talent with profound admiration. Nevertheless, the whole matter was becoming so deep, so involved that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{it with a}} shudder.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{left the}} room with a very sorrowful heart; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not feel the {{difference}} to be so small, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.|$|R
6000|$|In {{her next}} solitary walk to Cocksmoor, Norman joined Ethel. She was gratified, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> one safe word worth saying to him, {{and for a}} mile they {{preserved}} an absolute silence, until he first began, [...] "Ethel, I have been thinking--" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{silence and}} anxious looks {{returned}} {{as they drove}} from the station, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing to say but the old hope that the baby was better. As they stopped, he threw open the carriage-door, and springing out, impatiently rang.|$|E
60|$|And {{while she}} was pouring out all the {{comfortable}} words <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> Rose was softly bathing the eyes and dabbing the hot forehead with lavender-water, as her patient lay quiet with a {{look on his face}} that grieved her sadly.|$|E
60|$|ONCE upon a {{time there}} lived a King and Queen who had one charming daughter. She was so graceful and pretty and clever that she was called Graciosa, and the Queen was so fond of her that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing else.|$|E
60|$|The {{difference}} of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, {{which must be}} averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.|$|R
60|$|Maria {{took off}} her hat as suggested, and sat down meekly, full under fire of the glowing eyes that had {{produced}} such curious effects upon subjects so dissimilar as the late Mrs. Caresfoot and Jim Brady. <b>She</b> <b>could,</b> however, <b>think</b> <b>of</b> nothing appropriate to say.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{accordingly}} went, {{the next}} day, to ask Miss Mary {{about the cause}} of the failure. Miss Mary said that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any thing which was likely to be the cause, unless it was that they put too large a flame into the tumbler.|$|R
