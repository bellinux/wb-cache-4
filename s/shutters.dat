5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with <b>shutters</b> had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of <b>shutters</b> prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel of the door and window <b>shutters</b> depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the <b>shutters</b> and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E
50|$|Interchangeable-lens cameras with {{a central}} <b>shutter</b> within the lens body require that each lens has a <b>shutter</b> built into it. In {{practice}} most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane <b>shutter</b> in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central <b>shutter.</b> Many medium-format and most large-format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted {{with a central}} <b>shutter.</b> A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf <b>shutter.</b> Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane <b>shutter.</b> Some had both a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central <b>shutter</b> (for flash synchronisation); one <b>shutter</b> would be locked open.|$|R

50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, the <b>shutter</b> speed {{selector}} rotates when the <b>shutter</b> is released, {{and should not}} be changed until after the <b>shutter</b> has been cocked. If the <b>shutter</b> speed is changed without cocking the <b>shutter</b> first, the setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|R
5|$|In Puerto Rico, a {{man died}} after he {{collapsed}} from cardiac arrest {{while trying to}} install storm <b>shutters</b> on his home. As a tropical wave, the precedent to Omar produced heavy rains over the island, causing minor flooding. After passing by Puerto Rico a second time, Omar produced locally heavy rains, which caused minor street flooding.|$|E
5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, <b>shutters</b> and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden <b>shutters</b> and white-painted wooden lintels and sills.|$|E
50|$|These two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera <b>shutter</b> speed. In above situation, slow <b>shutter</b> speed makes image more clear and bright because the low <b>shutter</b> speed takes more light than high <b>shutter</b> speed.

Furthermore, performance is compared to that of a standard MEFM with an electrically grounded <b>shutter.</b> It is found that the dielectric silicon <b>shutter</b> MEFM has superior performance...|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm <b>shutters</b> on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched <b>shutters</b> and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Ruth Rosiene, a {{descendant}} of the Perkins and Ashlawn's owner, was featured in an article by The Day. Rosiene had been maintaining the house for years, which required repainting every four or five years. A photo in the article shows the latch on the door that was described as possibly original. The article notes that the original sliding <b>shutters</b> are now absent, whereas the original nomination form from 1979 stated they were not installed.|$|E
50|$|When using a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> with a flash, if the <b>shutter</b> {{is set at}} its X-sync {{speed or}} slower the whole frame will be exposed when the flash fires (otherwise only a band of the film will be exposed).Some {{electronic}} flashes can produce a longer pulse compatible with a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> operated at much higher <b>shutter</b> speeds. The focal-plane <b>shutter</b> will still impart focal-plane <b>shutter</b> distortions to a rapidly moving subject.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF has a metal, {{vertical}} travel, {{focal plane}} <b>shutter</b> with digital electronic control of <b>shutter</b> speed. There is {{no provision for}} non-electronic <b>shutter</b> release: charged batteries are always required for <b>shutter</b> operation.|$|R
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, the <b>shutter</b> speed {{should only}} be set after the <b>shutter</b> has been cocked. Setting the <b>shutter</b> speed before the <b>shutter</b> is cocked can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow <b>shutter</b> speeds under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, <b>shutters</b> and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel <b>shutters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shinano was {{designed}} to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and arming their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of Shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation, although steel <b>shutters</b> could close off most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.|$|E
50|$|A <b>shutter</b> {{cycle is}} the process of the <b>shutter</b> opening, closing, and {{resetting}} to where it is ready to open again. The life-expectancy of a mechanical <b>shutter</b> is often expressed as a number of <b>shutter</b> cycles.|$|R

50|$|The 5/A2/A2e has two dials {{to control}} exposure, {{one over the}} <b>shutter</b> button {{and one on the}} back of the camera. The dial above the <b>shutter</b> button will adjust the <b>shutter</b> speed in <b>shutter</b> {{priority}} Tv/Time value mode, but in aperture priority Av/Aperture value mode this same dial will adjust the lens aperture. In full manual mode, the dial above the <b>shutter</b> reverts to adjusting the <b>shutter</b> speed, and the back dial controls the aperture.|$|R
5|$|The Hachisuka scroll {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed <b>shutters).</b> Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|The oblique roof {{covering}} the eastern {{facade of the}} Chiayi Station features a high-tech image. The generator room is decorated with horizontal <b>shutters</b> that reflect a minimalist style. The columns and truss system in the station imitate trees; as they extend toward {{the outside of the}} building, the artificial elements are integrated into nature. When night falls, the ceiling is lit with thousands of lights over the truss system, resembling a starry night over the branches of a forest.|$|E
5|$|Work on Kingswear {{began in}} 1491, with the {{intention}} of providing protection to {{the east side of the}} estuary, and by the time it was completed in 1502 it formed one of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. It took the form of a three-storeyed, square tower built of slate rubble with red sandstone detailing. Its large, rectangular gun-ports with wooden <b>shutters</b> on the ground level matched those at Dartmouth Castle, and looked out close to the water at the entrance to the harbour, covering both the sea and the anchorage itself. The first floor would have also held guns and provided accommodation for the garrison.|$|E
5000|$|In photography, the shutter-release button (sometimes just <b>shutter</b> release or <b>shutter</b> button) is a {{push-button}} {{found on}} many cameras, {{used to take}} a picture. When pressed, the <b>shutter</b> of the camera is [...] "released", so that it opens to capture a picture, and then closes, allowing an exposure time {{as determined by the}} <b>shutter</b> speed setting (which may be automatic). Some cameras also utilize an electronic <b>shutter,</b> as opposed to a mechanical <b>shutter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Motion picture cameras used in {{traditional}} film cinematography employ a mechanical rotating <b>shutter.</b> The <b>shutter</b> rotation is synchronized with film being pulled through the gate, hence <b>shutter</b> speed {{is a function}} of the frame rate and <b>shutter</b> angle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shutter</b> is an {{electronically}} controlled focal-plane <b>shutter.</b> Its {{maximum speed}} is 1/8,000 of one second. The <b>shutter</b> is operated by an electromagnet.|$|R
5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel <b>shutters.</b> The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on October23, about 24hours before Wilma {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to the archipelago, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane <b>shutters,</b> as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stocked.|$|E
5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with <b>shutters.</b> Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
