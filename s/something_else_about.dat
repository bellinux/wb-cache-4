2500|$|So {{reads the}} {{pantomime}} scenario; {{what follows is}} Gautier's review of the piece:... the sight of this pantomime has filled our soul with melancholy. [...] What! [...] Pierrot, from whom of old one borrowed a pen—"to write a word"—and who loaned it so willingly, having {{not the least bit}} of interest in it himself, has been reduced by the misery of the times to making it run from morning to night over musty old documents! ... Pierrot! no longer daring to wear his white blouse and his wide trousers! [...] Pierrot in a black suit! [...] And what a black suit! threadbare, tight, curled at the cuffs with age, its seams blackened with ink: a perfect poem of respectable misery! [...] —When he sits down, what pitiful angles his knees make! [...] How pointed his elbows are! [...] What a black gaze is in that pale and flour-covered face! [...] This is what has become of the joyous Pierrot of the pantomime. [...] Pierrot has a profession; Pierrot is employed. [...] He has been made to realize that a century as serious as our own will not suffer the idle!Gautier's remark about Legrand's black suit says <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>about</b> the mime: that he was as comfortable in character costume (Deburau initiated the practice) as he was in the garb of Pierrot. [...] About this Gautier was ambivalent: the [...] "truthfulness" [...] of Legrand's acting was unprecedented, but how welcome it was for the spectator still enchanted by the fantasy of Deburau's stage was a valid question: [...] "By virtue of the verisimilitude of his acting," [...] writes Gautier, [...] " [...] turns the fantastic type into a human character whose white face comes as a surprise. [...] He often even abandons the linen blouse and trousers, retaining only the plaster mask, in order to represent beings that are more real." [...] The [...] "realism" [...] of Legrand's pantomime marked a dramatic—and, for some, a disturbing—turn in the fortunes of Pierrot.|$|E

I am afraid something is wrong; those engaging people are often unstable. One thing I forgot to tell you. We were walking through that belt of trees {{on the east side of}} the hill, when he suddenly called out to ask how came the old ash-tree to be marked. Markham answered in his gruff way, it was not his doing, but the Captain's. He turned crimson, and began some angry exclamation, but as Markham was going on to tell <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>about</b> it, he stopped him short, saying, 'Never mind! I dare say it's all right. I don't want to hear any more!' And I don't think he spoke much again till we got into the village. I am afraid there is some misunderstanding between the cousins.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house is}} built of these blocks; it is roofed with broad coral slabs an inch thick, whose edges lap upon each other, {{so that the}} roof looks like a {{succession}} of shallow steps or terraces; the chimneys are built of the coral blocks, and sawed into graceful and picturesque patterns; the ground-floor veranda is paved with coral blocks; also the walk to the gate; the fence is built of coral blocks--built in massive panels, with broad capstones and heavy gate-posts, and the whole trimmed into easy lines and comely shape with the saw. Then they put a hard coat of whitewash, as thick as your thumb-nail, on the fence {{and all over the}} house, roof, chimneys, and all; the sun comes out and shines on this spectacle, and it is time for you to shut your unaccustomed eyes, lest they be put out. It is the whitest white you can conceive of, and the blindingest. A Bermuda house does not look like marble; it is a much intenser white than that; and, besides, there is a dainty, indefinable <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>about</b> its look that is not marble-like. We put in a great deal of solid talk and reflection over this matter of trying to find a figure that would describe the unique white of a Bermuda house, and we contrived to hit upon it at last. It is exactly the white of the icing of a cake, and has the same unemphasized and scarcely perceptible polish. The white of marble is modest and retiring compared with it.|$|E

60|$|The {{archaeologist}} and {{the architect}} were {{left on the}} great stone steps smiling at each other; but whatever their common interests, they presented a considerable personal contrast, and the fanciful might even have found some contradiction in each considered individually. The former, a Mr. James Haddow, came from a drowsy den in the Inns of Court, full of leather and parchment, for the law was his profession and history only his hobby; he was indeed, among other things, the solicitor and agent of the Prior's Park estate. But he himself was far from drowsy and seemed remarkably wide awake, with shrewd and prominent blue eyes, and red hair brushed as neatly as his very neat costume. The latter, whose name was Leonard Crane, came straight from a crude and almost cockney office of builders and house agents in the neighboring suburb, sunning itself {{at the end of}} a new row of jerry-built houses with plans in very bright colors and notices in very large letters. But a serious observer, at a second glance, might have seen in his eyes something of that shining sleep that is called vision; and his yellow hair, while not affectedly long, was unaffectedly untidy. It was a manifest if melancholy truth that the architect was an artist. But the artistic temperament was far from explaining him; there was <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>about</b> him that was not definable, but which some even felt to be dangerous. Despite his dreaminess, he would sometimes surprise his friends with arts and even sports apart from his ordinary life, like memories of some previous existence. On this occasion, nevertheless, he hastened to disclaim any authority on the other man's hobby.|$|E

5000|$|His {{education}} {{went beyond}} music into spirituality. Rader met drummer Clarence [...] "Scoby" [...] Strohman while playing opposite the Marin Rivers trio. Strohman introduced Rader to books like Light on the Path by Mabel Collins and Paramahansa Yogananda's The Autobiography of a Yogi, which helped begin Rader's spiritual journey. Rader recalls an anecdote that touched his confidence as well. [...] "My music reading skills {{were not very}} good, but Scoby had lots of faith in me.
