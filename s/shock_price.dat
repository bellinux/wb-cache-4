40|$|Dynamic {{stochastic}} equilibrium {{models of}} macro economy {{are designed to}} match transient time series properties including impulse response functions. Gertler, Kiyotaki and others have extended this literature by introducing financing constraints that alter investment opportunities. Since these models aim to be structural, they have implications for asset pricing. To assess these implications, we consider asset pricing counterparts to impulse response functions. We quantify the exposures of alternative macroeconomic cash flows to shocks over alternative investment horizons and the corresponding prices or compensations that investors must receive because of their exposure to such shocks. We build on the continuous-time methods developed in Hansen and Scheinkman and our earlier work and construct discrete-time shock elasticities that measure the sensitivity of cash flows and their prices to economic shocks including economic shocks featured in the empirical macroeconomics literature. 2 / 24 OUTLINE ◮ Construct <b>shock</b> <b>price</b> and shock exposure elasticities as inputs into valuation accounting. ◮ Go beyond log-linearization methods to accommodate stochastic volatility and other sources of nonlinearity in the dynamic evolution. ◮ Previously- long-run cash flow predictability and time-variation in expected returns. ◮ Our aim- dynamic risk or shock exposure elasticities for cash-flows and dynamic risk or <b>shock</b> <b>price</b> elasticities...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on {{macroeconomic}} activities {{has attracted a}} great deal of attention since the 1970 s first oil <b>price</b> <b>shock.</b> Initially, many studies argue that there exist a significant negative impact of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on GDP, but recent empirical studies suggest a diminishing relationship between oil shocks and the macroeconomy. A key feature characterizing existing literature is that it applies predominantly to advanced oil-importing economies. For developing oil importing countries, different conclusions may be expected but this can be empirically ascertained. Despite the key role energy plays in industrial production and the socio-economic development of countries, many studies only focused on the causal link between oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> and output. This study therefore, employs a restricted VAR model and Johansen Cointegration test to investigate the impact of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on the macroeconomy of Ghana- a developing oil importing economy. The findings reveal that oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> have significant negative impact on output and economic activities in Ghana. We further employ a nonlinear oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> specification to account for asymmetric effects and we find that negative oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> adversely affect economic growth whiles positive oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> stimulate growth and increase output. Our results indicate a nonlinear oil-price macroeconomy relationship but no evidence of asymmetric effects exist between oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> and macroeconomic variables in Ghana.

40|$|Using {{a variant}} of the IMF''s Global Economy Model (GEM), {{featuring}} energy as both an intermediate input into production and a final consumption good, this paper examines the macroeconomic implications of large increases in the price of energy. Within a fully optimizing framework with nominal and real rigidities arising from costly adjustment, large increases in energy prices can generate an inflation response similar to that seen in the 1970 s if the monetary authority misperceives the economy''s supply capacity and workers resist the erosion in their real consumption wages resulting from the price increase. In the absence of either of these two responses, the model suggests that energy price shocks cannot generate the type of stagflation witnessed in the 1970 s. Further, even allowing for these two effects, the results do not suggest that the increase in the price of oil in late 1973 and early 1974 can fully explain the extent of the slowing in real activity or the magnitude of the acceleration in inflation experienced in the United States in 1974 and 1975.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} monetary shocks in a DSGE model that allows for a general form of smoothly state-dependent pricing by firms. As in Dotsey, King, and Wolman (1999) and Caballero and Engel (2007), our setup is based on one fundamental property: firms {{are more likely to}} adjust their prices when doing so is more valuable. The exogenous timing (Calvo 1983) and fixed menu cost (Golosov and Lucas 2007) models are nested as limiting cases of our setup. Our model is calibrated to match the steady-state distribution of price adjustments in microdata; realism calls for firm-specific shocks. Computing a dynamic general equilibrium requires us to calculate how the distribution of prices and productivities evolves over time. We solve the model using the method of Reiter (2008), which is well-suited to this type of problem because it combines a fully nonlinear treatment of firm-level state variables with a linearization of the aggregate dynamics. We compute impulse responses to iid and autocorrelated money growth shocks, and decompose the inflation impact into 'intensive margin', 'extensive margin' and 'selection' components. Under our most successful calibration, increased money growth causes a persistent rise in inflation and output. The real effects are substantially larger if money growth is autocorrelated. In contrast, if we instead impose a fixed menu cost specification, money growth shocks cause a sharp spike in inflation (via the selection component) so that the real effects are small and short-lived, especially if money growth is iid. An increase in aggregate productivity raises consumption but causes labor to fall. Also, impulse responses differ depending on the distribution at the time the shock occurs. In particular, increased money growth has different effects starting from the steady state distribution than it does if all firms have recently received an economy-wide productivity <b>shock.</b> <b>price</b> stickiness, state-dependent pricing, stochastic menu costs, generalized (S,s), heterogeneous agents, distributional dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is on price {{movements}} at market levels. This thesis examines the measurement of two aspects of price movements: the degree of price rigidity and pure price change. Price is defined to be rigid if its response to a demand or cost shock is slow and the magnitude of adjustment is proportionately less than the <b>shock.</b> <b>Price</b> rigidity {{is one of the}} critical issues in the microfoundations of macroeconomics, and its importance has been documented at least since Keynes' (1936) The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Regarding pure price change, in many markets the measurement of pure price change is difficult to obtain because the observed prices are contaminated by quality and compositional changes in the products. The literature on price indexes emphasises the importance of accounting for quality change at the market level. These issues will be explored in this thesis. The chapters of this thesis provide distinct but complementary contributions to the literature of price movement. Chapter 2 uses vector error correction models to estimate the degree of price rigidity in the retail coffee markets of 17 different countries. A stylised fact that emerges from the work is that price adjustment typically occurs within two quarters after a shock is imposed. In terms of the magnitude of price changes, prices are found to be more rigid to cost shocks than to foreign shocks. Chapter 3 explores the extent to which products follow systematic pricing patterns over their life cycle and the impact this has on the measurement of inflation. A number of specifications of hedonic models have been applied to data on supermarket and electronic products. Strong evidence of systematic life cycle effects has been found. Chapter 4 develops an hedonic regression model to construct multilateral indexes-indexes that are consistent across time and space-in housing markets. The set-up of the hedonic model attains some desirable properties, both in terms of statistical and index number perspectives. Applied to house prices in Sydney, the model generated some interesting results, including that the cheaper regions exhibit greater price dynamics than the more expensive regions.

With a positive marginal cost <b>shock,</b> <b>prices</b> are strategic complements: firms have more incentive to increase their price when other firms increase theirs. But for a negative <b>shock,</b> <b>prices</b> are strategic substitutes: firms have less incentive to lower prices when other firms lower theirs. We analyze this asymmetry {{in the context of}} a simple dynamic macro model, and examine the response of aggregate prices and quantities to monetary policy shocks. We stress two results of this exercise. First, for empirically relevant shocks there is a substantial difference between state-dependent and time-dependent pricing. Second, our state-dependent pricing model can account for business cycle asymmetries of the magnitude that have been found empiricallystate dependent pricing, business cycles, monetary shocks...|$|R

Empirically, I show that oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> have a large, persistent and statistically significant impact on the US terms of trade. Theoretically, I add oil in the model by Corsetti and Pesenti (2005) and analyse under what conditions the terms of trade plays a relevant role in the international transmission of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks.</b> With nominal <b>price</b> rigidities and full exchange rate pass-through positive oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> depreciate the currency of the oil importing country. The subsequent negative wealth effect adds to the recessive effect of the supply channel and may trongly reduce the consumption in the oil importing country economy. Without exchange rate pass-through oil shocks transmit to the economy only through the supply channel. The model suggests that a change in the exchange rate pass-through might contribute to explain the evidence of a weaker impact of oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> on the macroeconomic activity in recent times. oil <b>price</b> <b>shocks,</b> macroeconomic interdependence, exchange rate pass-through, propagation, transmission...|$|R

Results suggest that positive and negative house <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> have asymmetric effects on the probability of partnership dissolution. Negative house <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> significantly {{increase the risk of}} partnership dissolution, whereas positive house <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> do not have a significant effect in general. The destabilizing effect of negative house <b>price</b> <b>shocks</b> is particularly pronounced for couples with dependent children, low family income and high mortgage debt.
