5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks.

The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military.

Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666.

Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima joined the team after he had finished his work on Bahamut Lagoon.

The pursuit of Sephiroth that made up {{a large part of the}} main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as it had not been done in the series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations, and created Cloud's backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima's biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud's memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack.

5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E
