5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift <b>shafts</b> able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the <b>shafts</b> was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two <b>shafts</b> rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
5|$|The choir, of five bays, {{was built}} between 1283 and 1315 {{to the design}} of Richard Lenginour, and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture.

The sexpartite vault, which is a 19th-century restoration, is supported by clusters of three <b>shafts</b> which spring from energetic figurative corbels. The overall effect is robust, and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls, the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers, Clayton and Bell. The choir stalls, dating from about 1380, are one of the glories of the cathedral.|$|E

50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive <b>shaft</b> partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation.

In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven <b>shaft</b> will match that of the driving <b>shaft,</b> provided that both the driving <b>shaft</b> and the driven <b>shaft</b> are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate <b>shaft</b> (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase.
