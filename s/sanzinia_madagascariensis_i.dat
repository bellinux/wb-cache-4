50|$|<b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> (also {{known as}} the Malagasy tree boa, or Madagascar tree boa) is a non-venomous boa species endemic to the island of Madagascar. Two {{subspecies}} are currently recognized: S. m. madagascariensis and S. m. volontany.|$|R
50|$|It {{has since}} been shown that the Malagasy boids and the genus Boa do not form a {{monophyletic}} group, so that the lumping of Sanzinia, Acrantophis and Boa was incorrect, and the name <b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> is therefore the correct name for this species.|$|R
50|$|When Kluge (1991) moved <b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> (A.M.C. Duméril & Bibron, 1844) to Boa {{together}} with Acrantophis madagascariensis (A.M.C. Duméril & Bibron, 1844), {{it resulted in}} homonymy. To fix this nomenclatural problem, he proposed the specific name manditra {{as a replacement for}} S. madagascariensis.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> {{was moved}} to the genus Boa. To avoid having the same name as another snake it was renamed Boa manditra. On further {{investigation}} it was established that the move had been incorrect, so the original name was reinstated as the valid name.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis</b> madagascariensis is greenish in colour and {{is found}} {{on the east side}} of Madagascar, while S. madagascariensis volontany is {{brownish}} in colour and is {{found on the}} western side of the island. The separation of these subspecies has been supported on the basis of genetic data, and they may represent distinct species.|$|R
50|$|The native fauna of Madagascar {{are well}} represented. Ten species of {{amphibian}} and 44 reptile species are present. These include the rare Madagascan big-headed turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), the rhinoceros chameleon (Furcifer rhinoceratus) and the dwarf chameleon (Brookesia decaryi). There are two ground-dwelling boa constrictor snakes Acrantophis <b>madagascariensis</b> and <b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis,</b> and the rare terrestrial snake Liophidium therezieni.|$|R
50|$|One hundred {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} on the reserve, of which 63 are endemic to Madagascar, including the endangered Madagascan serpent eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and the red owl (Tyto soumagnei), which is a vulnerable species on the IUNC Red List. There are also nineteen species of reptiles and seven species of lemurs: Indri indri, Propithecus, Varecia variegata, Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus and the aye-aye. Among the reptiles, there are nineteen species, including Calumma gallus, Calumma furcifer and the Madagascar tree boa <b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (<b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis).</b> In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|R
40|$|An adult Madagascar tree boa (<b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis)</b> {{underwent}} coeliotomy {{for investigation}} of a coelomic mass. At surgery, a large mass originating from the peri-pancreatic adipose tissue and involving the gall bladder was removed. The snake did not recover from general anesthesia. A complete postmortem was performed, and samples were submitted to the University of Glasgow for histopathology. On histological examination, the mass was composed of adipose tissue infiltrated with a poorly demarcated spindle cell neoplasm. The neoplastic cells were highly pleomorphic with abundant cytoplasm and frequent clear cytoplasmic vacuoles, suggestive of adipocyte origin. Immunohistochemical characterization of the mass was inconclusive. Metastatic neoplastic cells were present within vessels in the liver, lungs, and brain. As an incidental finding, the gonads contained both maturing ovarian follicles and seminiferous tubules with intact germinal epithelium and evidence of spermatogenesis, along with other features {{of male and female}} gonad anatomy. The current report describes a rare neoplasm in snakes within an intersex Madagascar tree boa...|$|R
5000|$|The Boinae (a {{sub-family}} of boas) possess pelvic or anal spurs on {{each side}} of their cloaca. These spurs have a high degree of mobility and can be moved by appropriate musculature from their normal position lying along and against the body, into a perpendicular plane to resemble miniature legs. The pelvic spurs are usually held in the [...] "erect" [...] position and used by the male (at least) to stimulate the female. During mating, the male has a tendency to dig his pelvic spurs into the female's body. Whilst crawling over the female the male's spurs will scratch the surface of the female snake often making a distinct scratching sound. On other occasions the male's spurs will move rapidly in and out, up and down, again to stimulate the female snake. This supports the theory that the pelvic spurs have a sexual role. [...] In at least one species, the Madagascan Boa (<b>Sanzinia</b> <b>madagascariensis),</b> the spurs are also used in combat where they are erected perpendicular to the body and flexed vigorously against the scales of the opponent. [...] It has been claimed that pelvic spurs are retained parts of the pelvic girdle and are small, vestigial hind legs. [...] However, it has also been claimed the spurs are modified scales and {{do not appear to be}} linked to any bone structure. Male mating spurs are also found in most species of the chameleon genus Chamaeleo. A tarsal spur can be found on the back of the rear feet on male Veiled chameleons. This is present at birth and grows with age. It has been stated they are used in breeding.|$|R
40|$|Sanzinia and Acrantophis) MIGUEL VENCES & FRANK GLAW To {{assess the}} phylogeography and genetic {{variation}} of Malagasy boas {{of the genera}} Acrantophis (A. madagascariensis, A. dumerilii) and <b>Sanzinia</b> (S. <b>madagascariensis),</b> we analysed sequences of the 16 S rRNA gene in 12 Sanzinia and seven Acrantophis specimens. We found a surprisingly high differentiation between eastern and western/north-western populations of Sanzinia. This divergence was almost {{twice as high as}} between the two Acrantophis species. In spite of the absence of diagnostic morphological differences between eastern and western Sanzinia, the species status of these two ancient phylogeographic clades is probable, but can not be fully ascertained. We therefore describe the western Sanzinia populations as a new subspecies, based on a holotype specimen from Ankarafantsika forest, and diagnosed by its colour pattern (brown vs. mostly greenish in the nominate subspecies) and genetic differentiation. Unlike two widespread frog species that have a phylogeographically complementary east-west distribution, in Sanzinia the western subspecies reaches the Sambirano region (including Nosy Be) and probably Montagne des Français in northern Madagascar, while the rainforests of southern Madagascar (around Tolagnaro) are populated by the eastern subspecies. The Madagascar boas are widely distributed, relatively abundant and their occurrence is not restricted to pristine natural habitats. The current extent of local exploitation of these boas for food and leather apparently does not really threaten the species. However, the occurrence of the new subspecies seems to be more closely associated with the endangered dry forests of western Madagascar, and its status should therefore be carefully monitored...|$|R
