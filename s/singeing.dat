40|$|Single jersey cotton {{knit fabric}} of 162 GSM was <b>singed</b> both {{chemically}} (enzyme treatment) and mechanically. Mechanically <b>singed</b> fabric exhibited more brightness and whiteness than chemically <b>singed</b> fabric {{and in the}} same manner chemically <b>singed</b> fabric resulted more yellowness than mechanically <b>singed</b> fabric. The color fastness to washing of the treated fabric experienced almost same results in both of the cases. On the other hand chemically <b>singed</b> fabric focused on prevailing more strength than mechanically <b>singed</b> one which was evaluated by bursting strength test. Eventually the CMC value of the chemically and mechanically <b>singed,</b> and then dyed, fabric remained within acceptable range. Microscopic view of the treated samples was also taken to capture the surface hairiness characteristics...|$|R

25|$|Although a furbearer, the wildcat's skin is {{of little}} {{commercial}} value, due to the unattractive colour of its natural state, and the difficulties present in dyeing it. In the former Soviet Union, the fur of a forest wildcat usually fetched 50 kopecks, while that of a steppe wildcat fetched 60 kopecks. Wildcat skin is almost solely used for making cheap scarfs, muffs, and women's coats. It is sometimes converted into imitation sealskin. As a rule, wildcat fur is difficult to dye in dark brown or black, and {{has a tendency to}} turn green when the dye is not well settled into the hair. When dye is overly applied, wildcat fur is highly susceptible to <b>singeing.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{seeking to}} find who had {{set fire to}} the Farrar–Green home, {{investigators}} looked first for physical evidence of fire-setting upon those {{who had been in the}} house. They suspected that because of the use of accelerant, the fire may have flashed over at the point of ignition and singed or burned the setter. Accordingly, they tested clothing worn by both Farrar and Green that night and took samples of the hair of both. Neither Green's nor Farrar's clothing showed evidence of having been in contact with accelerant; Farrar's hair showed no <b>singeing,</b> but Green's—which had been cut twice between the time of the fire and the time the police took hair samples from her—showed [...] "significant singeing". Detectives recalled that Green had denied ever having been in close proximity to flames; she had reported leaving the house after seeing smoke and not coming into contact with the fire either on the deck outside her bedroom or in the process of coaxing Kate off the garage roof. Neighbors of the family reported that when Green had come to their door to ask them to call for help, her hair had been wet. Though their suspicions pointed to Debora Green, investigators continued to receive tips attributing the fire to any number of people and the investigation continued with no public statement about suspects.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila <b>singed</b> mutants {{were named}} for their gnarled bristle {{phenotype}} but severe alleles are also female sterile. Recently, <b>singed</b> protein {{was shown to}} have 35 % peptide identity with echinoderm fascin. Fascin is found in actin filament bundles in microvilli of sea urchin eggs and in filopodial extensions in coelomocytes. We show that Drosophila <b>singed</b> is required for actin filament bundle formation in the cytoplasm of nurse cells during oogenesis; in severe mutants, the absence of cytoplasmic actin filament bundles allows nurse cell nuclei to lodge in ring canals and block nurse cell cytoplasm transport. <b>Singed</b> is also required for organized actin filament bundle formation in the cellular extension that forms a bristle; in severe mutants, the small disorganized actin filament bundles lack structural integrity and allow bristles to bend and branch during extension. <b>Singed</b> protein is also expressed in migratory cells of the developing egg chamber and in the socket cell of the developing bristle, but no defect is observed in these cells in <b>singed</b> mutants. Purified, bacterially expressed <b>singed</b> protein bundles actin filaments in vitro with the same stoichiometry reported for purified sea urchin fascin. Singed-saturated actin bundles have a molar ratio of singed/actin of approximately 1 : 4. 3 and a transverse cross-banding pattern of 12 nm seen using electron microscopy. Our results suggest that <b>singed</b> protein is required for actin filament bundle formation and is a Drosophila homolog of echinoderm fascin...|$|R

40|$|We present <b>Singe,</b> a Domain Specific Language (DSL) {{compiler}} for combustion chemistry that leverages warp specialization to pro-duce {{high performance}} code for GPUs. Instead {{of relying on}} tra-ditional GPU programming models that emphasize data-parallel computations, warp specialization allows compilers like <b>Singe</b> to partition computations into sub-computations which are then as-signed to different warps within a thread block. Fine-grain synchro-nization between warps is performed efficiently in hardware using producer-consumer named barriers. Partitioning computations us-ing warp specialization allows <b>Singe</b> to deal efficiently with the irregularity in both data access patterns and computation. Further-more, warp-specialized partitioning of computations allows <b>Singe</b> to fit extremely large working sets into on-chip memories. Finally, we describe the architecture and general compilation techniques necessary for constructing a warp-specializing compiler. We show that the warp-specialized code emitted by <b>Singe</b> is up to 3. 75 X faster than previously optimized data-parallel GPU kernels...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an unstable allele of the singed-bristle locus on the X chromosome was studied {{in connection with}} the occurrence of lethal mutations on that same chromosome. The unstable allele, weak <b>singed</b> (snw), is {{under the control of the}} P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis and, in the M cytotype, mutates secondarily to extreme <b>singed</b> (sne) and to wild type (sn+) at high rates. Chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated in this fashion sustained lethal mutations at a rate of 3 %; whereas, those whose snw allele had apparently remained unchanged, acquired lethals at a lower rate, 1. 3 %. The significant difference between these values indicates a statistical coincidence between the phenomena of snw instability and X-linked lethal mutation induction. This coincidence can be explained by postulating that mutations at the <b>singed</b> locus sometimes release a genetic element capable of reinserting elsewhere in the chromosome. Alternately, snw instability and lethal induction might be associated because they are the effects of a common cause, perhaps some mutation-inducing substance present in various amounts in the germ cells of dysgenic flies. —The lethals that occurred on chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated to sne mapped preferentially close to <b>singed.</b> The lethals on the snw and sn+ chromosomes did not show this concentration on the map. Cytological analysis of samples of all three types of lethal chromosomes indicated that, with one exception, there was no detectable breakage at the <b>singed</b> locus itself. The single instance of breakage at <b>singed</b> was not associated with any change in the <b>singed</b> phenotype. Thus, the instability of snw apparently does not involve detectable breakage of the <b>singed</b> locus, or if it does, this breakage is not a common event...|$|R
