40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} stock {{structure}} of Atlantic sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> was investigated using {{analyses of the}} mitochondrial control region and three nuclear microsatellite loci. Relatively robust samples (n = 293) from 6 locations throughout the Atlantic were screened for variation at these four hypervariable gene regions. While considerable variation was revealed, {{almost all of the}} variation was present in individual samples. The null hypothesis that samples were drawn from a common gene pool could not be rejected when each sample location was considered separately, or when collections were combined into eastern and western Atlantic samples.

40|$|Sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> is a circumtropically {{distributed}} spe-cies (Hoolihan, 2005). Sailfish is {{a member}} of the billfish family, Istio-phoridae, which also includes marlins and spearfishes, and is considered a bycatch species in commercial fisher-ies. Off the eastern coast of Taiwan, sailfish are economically important and seasonally abundant from April to October (abundance peaks from May to July). Sailfish are mainly caught by drift gill nets, although some are also caught by set nets, harpoons, and as incidental bycatch in inshore long-line fisheries (Chiang, 2004). There are virtually no discards of sailfish in Taiwan. For the past decade, the annual landings of sailfish off Taiwan waters have fluctuated between 500 and 1000 metric tons, of which over 50 % have come from waters off Tai-tung (eastern Taiwan). Globally, large predatory fish spe-cies, including billfish, are declining at alarming rates because of exces-sive exploitation (Myers and Worm, 2003).

This study describes the diets of these billfish species, evaluates dietary differences between species, and assesses seasonal differences in diet. A total of 274 M. nigricans, 321 K. audax, 267 I. platypterus, and 252 X. gladius were collected between February 2014 and April 2015.

40|$|Abstract The {{reliability}} of estimations of catches of pelagic longline fisheries is especially worrying {{in the case}} of non-target species such as the sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> and spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), because they are often recorded aggregated in onboard maps. For this reason, generalized linear models were used to identify a number of important explanatory variables and their effect on sailfish and spearfish proportions. The response variable (number of sailfish in the aggregate capture) is assumed as binomial using the logit link function. The explanatory variables used were foram year, qrt (quarter), fleet, de (distance from equator) and d (distance from areas above sea level). The selected models showed that the equatorial and coastal regions presented higher densities or catchabilities of sailfish when compared to spearfish, as in the case for fleets of China Taipei and the United States. The lowest mean proportion of sailfish [sailfish/(sailfish + spearfish) ] of the third quarter were driven mostly by the low estimations calculated for Japan and Brazil...|$|R

Nine morphometric measurements were taken for a subset of larvae (species known), and lower jaw pigment patterns were recorded on a grid. Canonical variates analysis (CVA) was used to reveal {{the extent to which}} the combination of morphometric, pigment pattern, and month of capture information was diagnostic to species level. Linear regression revealed species-specific relationships between the ratio of snout length to eye orbit diameter and standard length (SL).

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of a novel form of group hunting. Individual sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> alternate attacks with other group members on their schooling prey (Sardinella aurita). While only 24 % of attacks result in prey capture, multiple prey are injured in 95 % of attacks, resulting in an increase of injured fish in the school {{with the number of}} attacks. How quickly prey are captured is positively correlated with the level of injury of the school, suggesting that hunters can benefit from other conspecifics' attacks on the prey. To explore this, we built a mathematical model capturing the dynamics of the hunt. We show that group hunting provides major efficiency gains (prey caught per unit time) for individuals in groups of up to 70 members. We also demonstrate that a free riding strategy, where some individuals wait until the prey are sufficiently injured before attacking, is only beneficial if the cost of attacking is high, and only then when waiting times are short. Our findings provide evidence that cooperative benefits can be realised through the facilitative effects of individuals' hunting actions without spatial coordination of attacks. Such "proto-cooperation" may be the pre-cursor to more complex group-hunting strategies...|$|R
40|$|Age {{and growth}} of {{sailfish}} (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> in waters off eastern Taiwan were examined from counts of growth rings on cross sections of the fourth spine of the first dorsal fin. Length and weight data and the dorsal fin spines were collected monthly at the fishing port of Shinkang (southeast of Taiwan) from July 1998 to August 1999. In total, 1166 dorsal fins were collected, of which 1135 (97 %) (699 males and 436 females) were aged successfully. Trends in the monthly mean marginal increment ratio indicated that growth rings are formed once a year. Two methods were used to back-calculate the length of presumed ages, and growth was described by using the standard von Bertalanffy growth function and the Richards function. The most reasonable and conservative description of growth assumes that length-at-age follows the Richards function and {{that the relationship between}} spine radius and lower jaw fork length (LJFL) follows a power function.

In addition, we used pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) to follow the fate of 61 blue marlin caught on natural baits rigged with circle hooks or on a combination of artificial lure and natural bait rigged with J hooks. The frequencies of internal hooking locations and bleeding were significantly lower with circle hooks than with J hooks {{for each of the three}} species and were significantly reduced for blue marlin caught on J hooks than for white marlin and sailfish taken on the same hook type.

The total number of days monitored (i. e., time that the tags remained attached) were 12 (sailfish I), 51 (sailfish II), 16 (sailfish III) and 43 days (sailfish IV). The results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat utilization {{with the majority of}} the time spent concentrated near the uniform sea surface layer occupying a relatively narrow temperature range. Despite the clear preference for epipelagic surface waters, sailfish regularly undertook vertical excursions into deeper waters (> 50 m) within three to six hour intervals. "Most Probable Tracks" (estimated from raw geolocations using the state-space Kalman filter model) and linear displacements suggested that tagged sailfish did not move significant distances from the tagging site.

40|$|The long {{historical}} data on sport fishing activities at Playa Grande Yachting Club (PGYC), lo-cated {{in the central}} Venezuelan coast near La Guaira, has served as an index to identify mayor trends in billfish abundance within the North Atlantic Ocean. In 1990, the Venezuelan Govern-ment issued a regulation restricting the landing and commercialization of billfish in a 50 -mile zone around La Guaira, {{in an effort to}} protect billfish populations in this area where sport fishing is particularly intense. The regulation induced misreporting of billfish catches by the sport fishers in PGYC, which lowered the quality of information in the {{historical data}}base after 1990.

Studies of the distribution and biology of the species are very limited. Tuna longline fishing by chartered vessels and the recent resources surveys in Indian seas have generated valuable data on sailfish.

The current fishing mortality rates were estimated as 0. 24 /yr and 0. 43 /yr for females and males, respectively, which are much lower than the estimated F 0. 1 (0. 62 /yr and 0. 79 /yr for females and males, respectively) and FSSB 40 (0. 46 /yr for females) which are commonly used as target reference points in fisheries management. The effects of the fishing mortality, natural mortality, and age at first capture on the estimates of biological reference points were evaluated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that failure to consider the uncertainty in parameters such as natural mortality or age at first capture may lead to the improper estimation of biological reference points.

40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{collections}} {{provide a}} valuable means to study fish life histories. However, these collections are greatly underutilized, as larval fishes are frequently not identified to species {{due to their}} small size and limited morphological development. Currently, there is an effort underway to make species identification more readily available across {{a broad range of}} taxa through the sequencing of a standard gene. This effort requires the development of new methodologies to both rapidly produce and analyse large numbers of sequences. The methodology presented in this paper addresses these issues with a focus on the larvae of large pelagic fish species. All steps of the methodology are targeted towards highthroughput identification using small amounts of tissue. To accomplish this, DNA isolation was automated on a liquid-handling robot using magnetic bead technologies. Polymerase chain reaction and a unidirectional sequencing reaction followed standard protocols with all template cleanup and transferring also automated. Manual pipetting was thus reduced to a minimum. A character-based bioinformatics program was developed to handle the large sequence output. This program incorporates base-call quality scores in two types of sample to voucher sequence comparisons and provides suggested identifications and sequence information in an easily interpreted spreadsheet format. This technique when applied to tuna and billfish larvae collected in the Straits of Florida had an 89 % success rate. A single species (Thunnus atlanticus) was found to dominate the catch of tuna larvae, while billfish larvae were more evenly divided between two species (Makaira nigricans and <b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of group living often depend on the spatial position of individuals within groups and the ability of individuals to occupy preferred positions. For example, models of predation events for moving prey groups predict higher mortality risk for individuals at the periphery and front of groups. We investigated these predictions in sardine (Sardinella aurita) schools under attack from group hunting sailfish (<b>Istiophorus</b> <b>platypterus)</b> in the open ocean. Sailfish approached sardine schools about equally often from the front and rear, but prior to attack there was a chasing period in which sardines attempted to swim away from the predator. Consequently, all sailfish attacks were directed at the rear and peripheral positions of the school, resulting in higher predation risk for individuals at these positions. During attacks, sailfish slash at sardines with their bill causing prey injury including scale removal and tissue damage. Sardines injured in previous attacks were more often found in the rear half of the school than in the front half. Moreover, injured fish had lower tail-beat frequencies and lagged behind uninjured fish. Injuries inflicted by sailfish bills may, therefore, hinder prey swimming speed and drive spatial sorting in prey schools through passive self-assortment. We found only partial support for the theoretical predictions from current predator-prey models, highlighting the importance of incorporating more realistic predator-prey dynamics into these models.
