50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was criticised as yielding poor handling at {{the extremes of}} performance though the model was considered easy to drive with its good vision, light <b>steering</b> (smallest <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of any production car) and controls, and ease of repair.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Conditions of Fitness, or more {{specifically}} the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> was challenged {{by a group}} of people who were adapting existing commercial vehicles into wheelchair accessible taxis for the provincial market. They wanted to enter the London market and argued that, with modern power <b>steering</b> the <b>turning</b> <b>circle,</b> which was a barrier to their entry was no longer necessary. The review found once more in favour of the status quo, but this decision was challenged by judicial review. After a protracted study, the PCO again found that the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> was essential to maintain mobility. The current conditions have been applicable since 1 January 2007.|$|R
50|$|With wheeled {{vehicles}} with 'normal' steering (i.e. {{one or two}} wheels at the front capable of <b>steering),</b> the vehicle's <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> {{is a measure of}} the space needed to turn the vehicle around while the steering is set to its maximum displacement from the central 'straight ahead' position - i.e. either extreme left or right. If a theoretical marker pen was placed on the point of the vehicle furthest from the centre of the turn, it would draw a circle and the diameter of that circle would give the value of that vehicle's <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> when measure using one's preferred units, imperial or metric.|$|R

50|$|Rear-wheel drive {{allows the}} Viano {{to have a}} smaller <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> than front-wheel drive rivals; Compact and Long models have a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of 11.8 m whereas the Extra-Long model turns in 12.5 m.|$|R
50|$|Many black cabs have a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of only 25 ft. One {{reason for}} this is the {{configuration}} of the famed Savoy Hotel: The hotel entrance's small roundabout meant that vehicles needed the small <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> in order to navigate it. That requirement became the legally required <b>turning</b> <b>circles</b> for all London cabs, while the custom of a passenger's sitting on the right, behind the driver, provided a reason for the right-hand traffic in Savoy Court, allowing hotel patrons to board and alight from the driver's side.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{relative}} novelty of the front-wheel-drive configuration, the manufacturer quoted the car's <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> as 12.5 m {{which was not}} greatly above the norm for cars of this size.

MATLAB-simulink was used to simulate <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> and zigzag maneuver. The simulation utilized model based on the concept of Mathematical Modelling Group (MMG) includes testing/separating components of the hull equations, propeller and rudder as well as the interaction among them (hull, propeller and rudder).

50|$|Whatever {{configuration}} of vehicle used, to be legally operated on UK roads, vehicles must {{adhere to the}} EU defined articulated vehicle <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> regulations, which state that any vehicle {{must be able to}} navigate a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> around a set-point, keeping the whole of the vehicle within a corridor bounded by two circles around that point, with the inner circle having a radius of 5.3 m, and the outer radius being 12.5 m. Vehicle <b>turning</b> <b>circles</b> are particularly important in the UK due to the historical existence of many narrow streets, and a high number of roundabouts.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Turning</b> <b>circle</b> â€” FF layouts {{almost always}} use a Transverse engine ("east-west") installation, which limits the amount {{by which the}} front wheels can turn, thus {{increasing}} the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of a front-wheel-drive car compared to a rear-wheel-drive one with the same wheelbase. A notable example is the original Mini. It is widely misconceived that this limitation {{is due to a}} limit on the angle at which a CV joint can be operated, but this is easily disproved by considering the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of car models that use a longitudinal FF or F4 layout from Audi and (prior to 1992) Saab ...|$|R

5000|$|For the 850, Volvo created what {{it called}} [...] "Delta-link semi-independent rear suspension". Volvo held a US patent for rear axle {{bushings}} that compress under load, giving the Volvo 850 passive rear steering. The automobile also has a tight <b>turning</b> <b>circle,</b> 10.2 m, and is considered very maneuverable. By comparison, later large Volvos had a 11.9 m <b>turning</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Two {{different}} measurements can be quoted for a vehicle. A curb or curb-to-curb <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> {{will show}} the straight-line distance {{from one side of}} the circle to the other, through the center. The name [...] "curb-to-curb" [...] indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a u-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel. If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a u-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall. The name wall or wall-to-wall <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a u-turn without scraping the walls. One can find these two ways of measuring the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> (in meters) of 12.1(C)/12.4(W).|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors such}} as: stern hull shape, length, draught, trim, {{propulsion}} system and external forces affecting the drift angle influence {{rate of turn}} and size of <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of ships. This paper discusses <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> characteristics of U and V stern hull shape of Very Large Crude Oil Carrier (VLCC) ships. The ships have same principal dimension such as length, beam, and draught. The <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> characteristics of the VLCC ships are simulated at 35 degree of rudder angle. In the analysis, firstly, <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> performance of U-type VLCC ship is simulated. In the simulation, initial ship speed is determined using given power and rpm. Hydrodynamic derivatives coefficients are determined by including effect of fullness of aft run. Using the obtained, speed and hydrodynamic coefficients, force and moment acting on hull, force and moment induced by propeller, force and moment induced by rudder are determined. Finally, ship trajectory, ratio of speed, yaw angle and drift angle are determined. Results of simulation results of the VLCC ship are compared with the experimental one as validation. Using the same method, V-type VLCC is simulated and the simulation results are compared with U-type VLCC ship. Results shows the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of U-type is larger than V-type due to effect stern hul results of simulation are...|$|R

50|$|The new Taxi {{does not}} perform the famous U-turn {{in the same}} way as the TX and Metro models , instead it {{incorporates}} an electrically operated rear wheel system, activated by a button adjacent to the <b>steering</b> wheel. This <b>turns</b> the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the front wheels, thus allowing the Taxi to perform the same tight <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> as the TX and Metro models. This system is only possible when the vehicle is traveling at less than 5 mi/h km/h, and if the vehicle goes over this speed while the LSM is active, it is deactivated, and the wheels straighten up.|$|R
50|$|The active steer system {{means the}} Eco-Link has a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of just 41 feet, {{the same as}} a {{conventional}} articulated lorry. This resolves a particular problem in the UK for LHV's, namely negotiating roundabouts. According to Roadway magazine, the Eco-Link could go anywhere a standard drawbar lorry could go, and in an RHA manoeuvrability trial it had passed <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> tests and had negotiated a slalom course consisting of cones spaced 12 m apart.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{turning radius}} is a {{technical}} term {{that has become}} popular automotive jargon. In the jargon sense, {{it is commonly used}} to mean the full diameter of the smallest circle, but in technical usage the turning radius still is used to denote the radius. The less ambiguous term <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> avoids the mistaken jargon use of the word 'radius' [...] As an example, Motor Trend refers to a curb-to-curb <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of a 2008 Cadillac CTS as 35.5 ft. But the terminology is not yet settled. AutoChannel.com refers to turning radius of the same car as 35.5 ft. It is often used as a generalized term rather than a numerical figure. For example, a vehicle with a very small <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> may be described as having a [...] "tight turning radius".|$|R
