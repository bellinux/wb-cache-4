Peak detection capability, when used correctly, can make up for acquisition memory shortfalls. by Steven B. Warntjes One of the most basic specifications in digital oscilloscopes is the maximum sample rate. Oscilloscope users often understand the theory of signal sampling and signal reproduction, but often mistakenly assume that the oscilloscope always samples at its maximum sample rate. In reality, two specifications need to be considered: the maximum sample rate and the acquisition memory behind the signal sampler. At {{all but a few}} of the fastest <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds,</b> the acquisition memory depth and not the maximum sample rate determines the oscilloscope’s actual sample rate and consequently how accurately the input signal is represented on the oscilloscope display. The deeper the acquisition memory, the longer the oscilloscope can sustain a high sampling frequency on slow time-per-division settings, thus increasing the actual sample rate of the oscilloscope and improving how the input signal looks on the oscilloscope screen. The digital oscilloscope’s peak detection specification is another often overlooked specification. This important feature, when used correctly, can make up for acquisition memory shortfalls. In addition, peak detection can be combined with dee...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} the first widely tunable, single-mode 1310 nm MEMS VCSELs with> 100 nm tuning range, {{and the first}} application of these VCSELs to ultra-high-speed swept source OCT imaging at axial scan rates up to 760 kHz. Swept source Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{has emerged as a}} powerful technique for obtaining micron scale 3 D images of biological tissue [1]. Emerging applications which require real-time acquisition of high-density, high volume data sets have driven the search for commercially viable swept laser sources around 1310 nm with ~ 40 mW output power,> 100 nm tuning range, and several hundred kHz or higher <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds</b> [2, 3]. MEMS tunable Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are an ideal swept source for OCT imaging, because of their micron scale cavity length and low mirror mass enabling high <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds,</b> single-mode operation without mode hops, long dynamic coherence length [4] enabling deep imaging, and compatibility with low-cost wafer-scale fabrication and testing. Though MEMS tunable VCSELs have existed for well over a decade [5, 6], limited tuning range and output power have thus far precluded application to OCT. In this work we demonstrate record sweep rates and bandwidths from VCSEL sources by integrating a wide-gain InP-based quantum well active region with a GaAs-based fully oxidized mirror through wafer bonding, as shown in Figs. 1, 2.

As of 2002, one major company owns and offers models in both competing designs, with engineering cross-pollination of techniques between the product design teams. As of 2005, it increasingly appears that the spiral CT designs, especially those with (b) 64 detector rows, (b) 3×360°/sec rotation speeds and designed for cardiac imaging, are largely replacing the EBT design from a commercial and medical perspective.

50|$|Electron beam {{tomography}} (EBT) is {{a specific}} form of CT in which a large enough X-ray tube is constructed so that only {{the path of the}} electrons, travelling between the cathode and anode of the X-ray tube, are spun using deflection coils. This type had a major advantage since <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds</b> can be much faster, allowing for less blurry imaging of moving structures, such as the heart and arteries. Fewer scanners of this design have been produced when compared with spinning tube types, mainly due to the higher cost associated with building a much larger X-ray tube and detector array and limited anatomical coverage. Only one manufacturer (Imatron, later acquired by General Electric) ever produced scanners of this design. Production ceased in early 2006.|$|R
50|$|Vollum and Murdock went on {{to found}} Tektronix, the first {{manufacturer}} of calibrated oscilloscopes (which included a graticule {{on the screen and}} produced plots with calibrated scales on the axes of the screen). Later developments by Tektronix included the development of multiple-trace oscilloscopes for comparing signals either by time-multiplexing (via chopping or trace alternation) or by the presence of multiple electron guns in the tube. In 1963, Tektronix introduced the Direct View Bistable Storage Tube (DVBST), which allowed observing single pulse waveforms rather than (as previously) only repeating wave forms. Using micro-channel plates, a variety of secondary-emission electron multiplier inside the CRT and behind the faceplate, the most advanced analog oscilloscopes (for example, the Tek 7104 mainframe) could display a visible trace (or allow the photography) of a single-shot event even when running at extremely fast <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds.</b> This oscilloscope went to 1 GHz.|$|R

50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer.

At present, streak cameras provide the most versatile direct optical recording techniques with picosecond time resolution, but they possess limited dynamic range.

This was experimentally investigated in this thesis, but found to be relatively unimportant. Effects inside the photocathode are suggested as an alternative explanation. The dynamic ranges, <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds</b> and linearity of two commercial streak camera systems were measured using a modelocked dye laser and an etalon.

These two streak cameras were then used to study the temporal evolution of the backscattered fundamental and harmonic emission spectra from micro balloon targets when they were irradiated by a neodymium laser. The spectra at the fundamental frequency displayed the characteristic red shift of Brillouin scattering. The spectral features of the 2 wq harmonic are explained in terms of ion acoustic turbulence driven by the electron return current. The harmonic spectra were observed to consist of two wings, symmetrically shifted to the blue and red, with a separation depending on the electron temperature. Both the 2 w and 3 w/ 2 harmonic emission were found to consist of picosecond pulsations which are attributed to density perturbations driven by the unstable ablation flow across a steepened density profile.

Spatial resolution is limited by the streak camera to 4 µm in one dimension; the imaging system has superior resolution of 1 µm. High light collection efficiency means that the diagnostic can transmit a measurable quantity of thermal emission at temperatures as low as 1 eV to the detector. This is achieved through the use of an f/ 1. 4 objective, and a minimum number of reflecting and refracting surfaces to relay the image over 8 m with no vignetting over a 0. 4 mm field of view with 12. 5 × magnification. All the system optics are highly corrected, to allow imaging with minimal aberrations over a broad spectral range.

Over this range the cameras had a response which varied between 47 ± 8 and 14 ± 4 photons/count. The calibration of the optical imaging system makes absolute temperature measurements possible.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} a reference streak camera (SC) to diagnose laser performance and guide modifications to remove high frequency noise from Bechtel Nevada's long-pulse laser. The upgraded laser exhibits less than 0. 1 % high frequency noise in cumulative spectra, exceeding National Ignition Facility (NIF) calibration specifications. Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments require full characterization of streak cameras over a wide range of <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds</b> (10 ns to 480 ns). This paradigm of metrology poses stringent spectral requirements on the laser source for streak camera calibration. Recently, Bechtel Nevada worked with a laser vendor to develop a high performance, multi-wavelength Nd:YAG laser to meet NIF calibration requirements. For a typical NIF streak camera with a 4096 x 4096 pixel CCD, the flat field calibration at 30 ns requires a smooth laser spectrum over 33 MHz to 68 GHz. Streak cameras are the appropriate instrumentation for measuring laser amplitude noise at these very high frequencies since the upper end spectral content is beyond the frequency response of typical optoelectronic detectors for a single shot pulse. The SC was used to measure a similar laser at its second harmonic wavelength (532 nm), to establish baseline spectra for testing signal analysis algorithms. The SC was then used to measure the new custom calibration laser. In both spatial-temporal measurements and cumulative spectra, 6 - 8 GHz oscillations were identified. The oscillations were found to be caused by inter-surface reflections between amplifiers. Additional variations in the SC spectral data were found to result from temperature instabilities in the seeding laser. Based on these findings, laser upgrades were made to remove the high frequency noise from the laser output...|$|R
