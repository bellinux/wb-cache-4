5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and <b>shoaling</b> behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (<b>shoaling),</b> {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} also form {{associations with}} non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push <b>shoaling</b> fish towards the surface. Hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, {{in which they}} forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.|$|E
5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun <b>shoaling</b> fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E

30|$|During the depositional {{period of}} KT-II, the open {{platform}} water energy changed intermittently, {{leading to the}} alternate deposition of high-energy <b>shoals,</b> low-energy <b>shoals,</b> and inter <b>shoals</b> (the low-lying land between <b>shoals).</b> Nonreservoirs deposited between <b>shoals</b> are tight and strong in resistance to pressure, while reservoirs between <b>shoals</b> are loose and weak in resistance to pressure. Under tectonic stress, the reservoirs of high-energy <b>shoals</b> and low-energy <b>shoals</b> would release pressure first since their particles were breaking up, resulting {{in the formation of}} microfractures; then, the tight nonreservoirs between <b>shoals</b> would form macrofractures. Thus, structural macrofractures of open platform facies carbonate deposition are mostly present in tight nonreservoirs, accounting for 84.4  %, and seldom in low-energy <b>shoals.</b> High-energy <b>shoals</b> are dominated by granular fracturing microfractures.|$|R
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) <b>shoaling</b> species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against <b>shoaling</b> fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through <b>shoaling</b> fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push <b>shoaling</b> fish up towards the surface.|$|E

40|$|Observations {{were made}} on three fish species (banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni)) in a {{temperate}} lake (New Brunswick, Canada) in order to investigate the relationship between <b>shoal</b> choice behaviour of individual fishes and <b>shoal</b> composition. Encounters between <b>shoals</b> were observed to take place every 1. 1 min per <b>shoal</b> and an encounter lasted 3. 7 s on average. The duration of <b>shoal</b> encounters was influenced by <b>shoal</b> size but not by differences between <b>shoals</b> in either body length or species. Conversely, the outcome of <b>shoal</b> encounters (i. e. ences between <b>shoals</b> in either body length or species. Conversely, the outcome of <b>shoal</b> encounters (i. e. whether or not an individual changes <b>shoal)</b> was influenced by body length and species differences but not by <b>shoal</b> size. Together, {{these results suggest that}} encounter duration itself is unlikely to have an important influence on encounter outcome. The collection of ten entire fish <b>shoals</b> showed that they were assorted by species and body length. A simulation model demonstrated that individual <b>shoal</b> choice behaviour alone could account for the generation and maintenance of the observed levels of size assortedness of <b>shoals</b> without invoking the existence of other sorting mechanisms such as differential swimming speeds. However, the generation of species assortedness was not predicted by the model. Furthermore, our data suggest that fish density acts as a constraint on <b>shoal</b> choice, influencing both <b>shoal</b> size and composition. This work has implications for studies on information transfer and reciprocal altruism within populations...|$|R

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. <b>Shoaling</b> and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push <b>shoaling</b> fish up towards the surface.|$|E
25|$|If, in addition, the {{aggregation}} {{comes together}} in an interactive, social way, they {{may be said to}} be <b>shoaling.</b> Although <b>shoaling</b> fish can relate to each other in a loose way, with each fish swimming and foraging somewhat independently, they are nonetheless aware of {{the other members of the}} group as shown by the way they adjust behaviour such as swimming, so as to remain close to the other fish in the group. <b>Shoaling</b> groups can include fish of disparate sizes and can including mixed-species subgroups.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shoaling</b> {{fish can}} shift into a disciplined and coordinated school, then shift {{back to an}} {{amorphous}} shoal within seconds. Such shifts are triggered by changes of activity from feeding, resting, travelling or avoiding predators.|$|E

25|$|One puzzling {{aspect of}} <b>shoal</b> {{selection}} {{is how a}} fish can choose to join a <b>shoal</b> of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance.
