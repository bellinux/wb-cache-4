50|$|Steam and {{mechanical}} <b>power</b> <b>hammers</b> were made {{into the middle}} of the 20th century in the United States. At the end of the 19th century the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> became popular in smaller blacksmith and repair shops. These machines were typically rated between 25 and 500 pounds of falling weight. Many may still be seen in use in small manufacturing and artist-blacksmith shops today. In the middle of the 20th century <b>power</b> <b>hammers</b> driven by compressed air began to gain popularity and several manufacturers are currently producing these hammers today.|$|R

50|$|A typical <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> {{consists}} of a frame, an anvil, and a reciprocating ram holding a hammer head or die. The workpiece {{is placed on the}} lower anvil or die and the head or upper die strikes the workpiece. The <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> is a direct descendant of the trip hammer, differing in that the <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> stores potential energy in an arrangement of mechanical linkages and springs, in compressed air, or steam, and {{by the fact that it}} accelerates the ram on the downward stroke. This provides more force than simply allowing the weight to fall. Predecessors like trip hammers, steam drop hammers, board or strap <b>hammers,</b> used the <b>power</b> source to raise the ram or hammer head, but let it fall solely under gravity.|$|R

2500|$|In modern times, {{industrial}} forging is done {{either with}} presses or with <b>hammers</b> <b>powered</b> by compressed air, electricity, hydraulics or steam. These hammers may have reciprocating weights {{in the thousands}} of pounds. Smaller <b>power</b> <b>hammers,</b> [...] or less reciprocating weight, and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well. Some steam hammers remain in use, but they became obsolete with {{the availability of the}} other, more convenient, power sources.|$|R

50|$|Steam hammers {{proved to}} be {{invaluable}} in many industrial processes. Technical improvements gave greater control over the force delivered, greater longevity, greater efficiency and greater <b>power.</b> A steam <b>hammer</b> built in 1891 by the Bethlehem Iron Company delivered a 125-ton blow. In the 20th century steam hammers were gradually displaced in forging by mechanical and hydraulic presses, but some are still in use. Compressed air <b>power</b> <b>hammers,</b> descendants of the early steam hammers, are still manufactured.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>hammers</b> are {{mechanical}} forging hammers {{that use}} a non-muscular power source {{to raise the}} hammer preparatory to striking, and accelerate it onto the work being hammered. Also called [...] "Open Die Power Forging Hammers." [...] They {{have been used by}} blacksmiths, bladesmiths, metalworkers, and manufacturers since the late 1880s, having replaced trip hammers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{product of}} the finery was a bloom or loop (from old Frankish luppa or [...] lopp, meaning a shapeless mass); that of the {{puddling}} furnace was a puddled ball. In each case, this needed to be consolidated by hammering into a more regular shape. This was done using a <b>power</b> <b>hammer,</b> worked manually with heavy hammers or later by a waterwheel or steam <b>powered</b> <b>hammers.</b> The result was an oblong shaped iron product similar in appearance to shingles used on roofs. In the finery, {{this was part of}} the work of the finer; during puddling, it was done by a special workman called the shingler. The iron (or steel) then had to be further shaped (drawn out) under the hammer or rolled in a rolling mill to produce a bar. In more recent times, the process was carried out using mechanical jaws to squeeze the puddled ball into shape.|$|R
