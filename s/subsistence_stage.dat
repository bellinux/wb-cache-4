40|$|The {{development}} of {{sheep and goat}} farming in Northeast region of Brazil {{is not only a}} subsistence activity among family farmers, but also in recent decades it has emerged as an important sustainable activity, overcoming the precarious <b>subsistence</b> <b>stage</b> and giving prospects for Brazilian agribusiness consolidation. However, some challenges still need to be overcome in order for this creation is profitable, such as the management of all stages of the creation of these animals, especially with the pre-slaughter management, where the greatest number of losses due to the stress caused to the animal, which consequently affects the welfare and the production. Thus, this review will address these issues in more details and clarify the possible damages caused by improper management during the pre-slaughter. </p...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. The {{agricultural}} sector {{is important in}} South Africa, because it contributes approximately 4 percent to the countryâ€™s Gross Domestic Product. Agriculture can contribute significantly to economic growth, by means of food production and job creation, and thereby it {{can play an important}} role in reducing poverty. This paper examines the contribution of agriculture to economic growth in South Africa, and its possible role in poverty alleviation. It begins by conducting a literature review of the contribution of agriculture to economic growth. In particular, it examines two stages of farming, namely, the <b>subsistence</b> and commercial <b>stages,</b> to determine how each of these contributes to economic growth and poverty alleviation. It finds that both of these stages have undergone little improvement over the years and have performed poorly. Next, the challenges that prevent the farming sector from performing better are described and investigated in detail. Importantly, unavailability of the data in the subsistence sector makes it harder to arrive at a conclusion as to whether agriculture contributes to poverty alleviation. Despite these challenges, the study finds that agriculture remains the key to survival for most of the rural poor. Finally the paper draws conclusions and makes recommendations for policy measures to increase growth in the {{agricultural sector}} based on the findings of the research. The key conclusion emanating from this study is that agriculture does not indeed contribute to economic growth and that it is able to alleviate poverty. However, resources such as land, skilled labour, machinery and capitals are a major limiting factor. As for recommendations, a critical strategy must be to recapitalise agriculture, investing more heavily in this sector and in programmes to develop rural economic and social infrastructure. Public investment needs to be directed in particular towards promoting agricultural research and extension, improving access to financial services, providing investment incentives, and increasing access of the poor to support services and productive resources. The study concludes that data and information should be separated between subsistence and commercial farmers to be able to determine whether agriculture contributes to poverty alleviation...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{problems}} in the developing countries pose a policy dilemma. For the economy to advance from a <b>subsistence</b> and impoverished <b>stage</b> to a self sustained developed economy requires extensive energy fed modernization. In all sectors that could be targeted which include agriculture, industry and services, the energy implications depend on the strategy adopted. Both the capital and labour intensive strategies of development involve some basic energy implications. Especially since the 1973 oil price increases, these problems have been exacerbated with the oil importing developing countries like Tanzania being particularly hit. The little that had been achieved in terms of growth was subsequently wiped out. While {{this is true of}} the oil importing developing countries, oil exporting developing countries like Nigeria were able to temporarily weather the storm but these countries are still faced with enormous energy problems. The inability of Nigeria to achieve internal energy balances in the face of huge energy resource endowments, indeed, in overall development, opens a new dimension to the analysis of underdevelopment. It clearly indicates the need to shift emphasis away from the 'traditional' premise of 'lack of resources' as a focal point and platform from which underdevelopment is analysed. There is a need to focus on inefficient managerial capabilities and inept Leadership which are themselves problems of underdevelopment. With particular reference to energy, such incapability also throws some light to the technical problems highlighted, by the fact that relative to the dynamics of the underdeveloped economies, the possibility of fuel substitution in commercial energy on the one hand, and on the other, traditional energy for commercial energy is limited. Understanding the dynamics of these problems necessarily indicate the complexity of energy problems and indeed, overall development {{problems in}} the developing countries. Thus, while attempts to increase supply to satisfy demand may be necessary, we believe that other areas of policy such as effective energy management and energy conservation are also vital and important to the overall strategy. This aspect of energy is controversial. Whether energy privatisation or overhauling existing bureaucracy will provide the optimal solution is debatable. Thus, the thesis focuses attention on the role of energy in development, sources of energy in the two countries, and on the appraisal of energy institutions and management in developing countries...|$|R
