25|$|For example, {{the session}} and {{presentation}} {{layers of the}} OSI suite {{are considered to be}} included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the <b>session</b> <b>layer</b> can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like Telnet and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). <b>Session</b> <b>layer</b> functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite.

25|$|Each Net-Lib {{supported}} {{network protocol}} has a separate driver (not {{to be confused}} with a device driver), and has support for a <b>session</b> <b>layer</b> in its protocol stack. There are two general types of Net-Lib: the primary and the secondary. The primary Net-Lib consists of a Super Socket Net-Lib and the Shared Memory Net-Lib, while there are numerous secondary Net-Libs, including TCP/IP and named pipes network libraries (named pipes are a method of communicating with other processes via a system-persistent pipeline that is given an identity). The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) communicates via primary Net-Libs.|$|E
25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the <b>session</b> <b>layer,</b> are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|E

Finally, it presents a testbed implementation where this approach was experimentally validated...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} {{a new type of}} mobility management for IP-based networks that, contrary to conventional approaches, does not focus on the network layer, but on the transport and <b>session</b> <b>layers.</b> At the heart of this new mobility concept is the reliable transport protocol SCTP, with an enhancement for dynamic address reconfiguration. The reliable server pooling (RSer-Pool) protocol suite provides a service for session monitoring and control. The suggested solution is transparent for applications, requires no changes in the network infrastructure, and is evaluated with a real-world implementation. Finally, we present first results from the application of this mobility concept to different mobility scenarios. These were obtained from working SCTP and RSerPool implementations that have been developed within our group. 1...|$|R

40|$|Delay- and disruption-tolerant {{networks}} (DTNs) {{have received}} much {{attention from the}} research community {{in recent years and}} are likely {{to play an important role}} in future networking. DTNs can bring much-needed connectivity to rural areas and other settings with limited or non-existing infrastructures. High node mobility and infrequent connectivity inherent to DTNs make it challenging to implement simple and traditional security services, e. g., message integrity and confidentiality. In particular, it is hard to retrieve credentials of peer users/nodes. Also, multi-round security protocols (typically found in handshakes at network and <b>session</b> <b>layers)</b> are greatly handicapped due to long and uneven delays. In this paper, we focus on the problem of initial secure context establishment in DTNs. We construct a scheme that allows DTN users to leverage social contact information in order to exchange confidential and authentic messages. We show how the proposed scheme applies for both intra- and inter-region communication scenarios. 1...|$|R

40|$|Many secure {{communication}} libraries used by distributed systems, such as SSL, TLS, and Kerberos, {{fail to make}} {{a clear distinction between}} the authentication, <b>session,</b> and communication <b>layers.</b> In this paper we introduce CEDAR, the {{secure communication}} library used by the Condor High Throughput Computing software, and present the advantages to a distributed computing system resulting from CEDAR's separation of these layers. Regardless of the authentication method used, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be used for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to security sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network authentication. The creation of a distinct <b>session</b> management <b>layer</b> allows for optimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other components in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that reduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized enforcement of system-wide security policies. Additionally, secure channels based upon UDP datagrams are often overlooked by existing libraries; we show how CEDAR's structure accommodates this as well. As an example of the utility of this work, we show how the use of delegated security sessions and other techniques inherent in CEDAR's architecture enables US CMS to meet their scalability requirements in deploying Condor over large-scale, wide-area grid systems...|$|R
