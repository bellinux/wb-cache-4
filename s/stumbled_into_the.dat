5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> most {{effective}} German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|By 23:30, the High Seas Fleet {{had entered}} its night {{cruising}} formation. The order had largely been inverted, {{with the four}} Nassau-class ships in the lead, followed directly by the Helgolands, with the Kaisers and Königs astern of them. The rear was again brought up by the elderly pre-dreadnoughts; the mauled German battlecruisers were by this time scattered. At around midnight on 1 June, the Helgoland- and Nassau-class ships {{in the center of}} the German line came into contact with the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. The 4th Flotilla broke off the action temporarily to regroup, but at around 01:00, unwittingly <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German dreadnoughts a second time. Helgoland and Oldenburg opened fire on the two leading British destroyers. Helgoland fired six salvos from her secondary guns at the destroyer Fortune before she succumbed to the tremendous battering. Shortly after, Helgoland shifted fire to an unidentified destroyer; Helgoland fired five salvos from her 15cm guns to unknown effect. The British destroyers launched torpedoes at the German ships, but they managed to successfully evade them with a turn to starboard.|$|E

The lines were so close that some {{soldiers}} accidentally <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camps of the opposing army.

The Confederate cavalry attempted a pursuit but failed to cause significant damage to the Union army.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1863, Mosby led 100 men on a raid {{across the}} Potomac River {{to attack the}} Union camp at Seneca, Maryland. After routing a company of the Sixth Michigan Cavalry and burning their camp, Mosby {{reported}} the success to J.E.B. Stuart. This drew Stuart's attention to Rowser's Ford. Mosby had crossed the Potomac there, and during the night of June 27 Stuart's forces would use the same crossing while separated from Lee's army, and thus didn't arrive at Gettysburg until {{the afternoon of the}} second day of the battle. Thus, some analysts claim Lee <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> battle without his cavalry, partly because of Mosby's successful skirmish at Seneca three weeks earlier.|$|E
500|$|After {{successfully}} {{withdrawing from}} the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard Friedrich der Grosse and , the lead ship, caused delays. The series of reversals in course and confused maneuvers disorganized the fleet and inverted the sequence of ships, but by 23:30 the fleet had reached its cruising formation. Friedrich der Grosse was now the ninth ship {{in a line of}} twenty-four, headed by the eight I Squadron ships. Shortly after 01:00, the British cruiser [...] <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German line. Searchlights aboard [...] illuminated the target; Friedrich der Grosse, Thüringen, , and [...] hammered the cruiser at point-blank range with main and secondary guns.

A chaotic night battle ensued, during which [...] rammed the British {{destroyer}} [...] The 4th Flotilla broke off the action temporarily to regroup, but at around 01:00, unwittingly <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German dreadnoughts a second time. Oldenburg and Helgoland opened fire on the two leading British destroyers, but a British shell destroyed Oldenburgs forward search light. Shell fragments rained down on the bridge and wounded the ship's captain, Kapitän Hopfner, and killed his second in command, Kapitänleutnant Rabius, along with a number of other men on the bridge, including the helmsman. Oldenburg was temporarily without anyone to steer the ship; she was in danger of ramming either the ship to her rear or to her front. Kapitän Hopfner, despite his injuries, took the helm and brought the ship back into line.|$|E
500|$|By 20:15, the German battle {{line had}} faced the entire {{deployed}} Grand Fleet a second time. Scheer ordered a 180-degree turn at 20:17, which {{was covered by}} a charge by the battlecruiser squadron and a torpedo-boat attack. In order to hasten the maneuver, Schmidt ordered Ostfriesland to turn immediately without waiting for Thüringen behind him. This move caused some difficulty for the IIISquadron ships ahead, though the ships quickly returned to their stations. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Ostfriesland was the eighth ship, stationed {{toward the front of}} the 24-ship line. An hour later, the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued. Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser [...] <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German line. Thüringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5cm rounds into the ship. Ostfriesland fired with her 15cm guns and Kaiser fired both 30.5cm and 15cm guns. In the span of less than a minute, two massive explosions tore the cruiser apart and killed the entire 857-man crew.|$|E

The first salvo struck near Black Princes rear gun turret, which appears to have been blown overboard. Thüringen fired a total of ten 30.5cm, twenty-seven 15cm, and twenty-four 8.8cm shells. She was joined by three other battleships, and Black Prince was soon destroyed by a huge ammunition explosion. Around a half an hour later, Thüringen spotted what appeared to be a Birkenhead-class cruiser. She fired a starshell to illuminate the British cruiser and opened fire with her secondary guns. The ship was actually the destroyer [...] Thüringen fired eighteen 15cm and six 8.8cm shells before launching another starshell.

500|$|Shortly after 20:00, the German battleships {{engaged the}} 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Markgraf fired {{primarily}} 15cm shells. In this period, Markgraf was engaged by s 12-inch guns, which scored a single hit at 20:14. The shell failed to explode and shattered on {{impact on the}} 8-inch side armor, causing minimal damage. Two of the adjoining 14-inch plates directly below the 8-inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred. The heavy fire of the British fleet forced Scheer to order the fleet to turn away. Due to her reduced speed, Markgraf turned early {{in an attempt to}} maintain her place in the battle line; this, however, forced Grosser Kurfürst to fall out of formation. Markgraf fell in behind Kronprinz while Grosser Kurfürst steamed ahead to return to her position behind König. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard [...] and , the lead ship, caused delays. Several British light cruisers and destroyers <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German line around 21:20.

2500|$|During the battle, another burning {{ship was}} spotted in the {{distance}} from Oscarsborg, leading the Norwegian defenders to believe they had sunk one more German warship in addition to Blücher.

2500|$|Tunisia {{players and}} {{supporters}} {{claim that the}} Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla failed to award Tunisia a penalty kick {{in the second half}} and then mistakenly awarded one to Ukraine, which when converted by Andriy Shevchenko resulted in the 1–0 win and qualification by Ukraine to the second round. [...] At the time Tunisia was playing with 10 men since Ziad Jaziri was sent off for his second yellow card in the last minute of the first half. The German magazine Spiegel Online described the turn of events this way: [...] "Tunisia went close on 65 minutes after Namouchi was hacked {{down on the edge of}} the box. Ayari's left footed free kick deflected off Voronin in the Ukrainian wall and crept just over the bar. Replays suggested the ball hit Voronin's elbow and Tunisia could feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Then almost immediately the action switched to the other end when Shevchenko <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> penalty area only to be brought down by Haggui. This time replays suggested Shevchenko fell over his own feet but Amarilla pointed to the spot and Shevchenko made no mistake with the penalty kick. It was tough luck for the Tunisians with two dodgy decisions costing the team badly and with only ten men left on the field the game looked beyond them." ...|$|E

2500|$|General Washington {{attacked}} the German garrison at Trenton on 26 December, though Cadwalader's brigade {{were unable to}} arrive in time to affect the battle for Trenton, due to problems crossing the ice-choked Delaware River. Cadwalader finally crossed the river on 27 December on his own initiative, reaching Trenton by 2 January as Washington concentrated his army. As Cadwalader and his brigade managed to reach Trenton on 2 January from across the Delaware River, the Continental Marines watched the cannonade between the Continental Army and Lord Cornwallis' British Army at Assunpink Creek. The Marines helped defend a crucial bridge against a Hessian attack. On the night of 3 January, Cadwalader's brigade (including Major Nicholas's battalion of Continental Marines) and General Washington's Army silently departs the battlefield and marches toward Princeton. [...] By daybreak, they launched a two-pronged attack. The first prong of attack, led by Brigadier General Hugh Mercer, {{a close friend of}} George Washington, attacked a British stronghold. [...] Mercer's brigade ran into heavy, well-disciplined musketry of two British regiments that were emplaced in front of Princeton, Mercer's brigade position soon collapsed. [...] Cadwalader's brigade (along with the Marines) came to the assistance, but too <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> British infantry forcing them to fall back. The second prong of attack caught the British in open flank, scattering three British regiments. It gave Washington's forces the advantage to take Princeton.

2500|$|Sporadic engagements {{continued}} to be reported as 32 Battalion began actively searching out PLAN's forward operating bases. The first was discovered on 22 February, when a sweep {{in the vicinity of}} Chana Henombe encountered one two kilometres southeast of the village. A 32 Battalion platoon <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camp's trench network and an estimated 100 guerrillas responded to the scene with RPG-7s and small arms. The platoon also reported coming under heavy mortar fire. After ten minutes of shooting, the guerrillas escaped unharmed into the bush and scattered. A second platoon led by Lieutenant Gerrit [...] "Gert" [...] Keulder also investigated Chana Mamuandi, arriving there on March 1. Their patrol made contact with a PLAN cadre which immediately broke and ran. Seven nights later, 32 Battalion also combed Chana Hangadima but reported no sign of the enemy. By noon the following day the platoons had swept the fringe of Chana Henombe without encountering resistance. Keulder found an abandoned PLAN base in the Nutalala area and destroyed it. As the South Africans prepared to depart in the late afternoon, they were engaged by about 300 insurgents mounting a vicious counterattack. The PLAN group mortally wounded Lieutenant Keulder before withdrawing, leaving their five dead behind them. At this point it became clear that PLAN either lacked the willingness or capability to fight sustained battles, as even when 32 Battalion was outnumbered and outgunned their assailants would only exchange fire for about ten minutes. The cadre would then disappear into the bush. Similar tactics were observed in the closing weeks of Seiljag – for instance, when sweeping a final PLAN base on the Huavala River a Lieutenant Des Burman's platoon encountered token opposition from guerrillas in a fortified trench complex. Despite initially responding with machine gun fire and RPGs, PLAN soon abandoned its advantageous position and retreated to the northwest. The South Africans scoured the trenches and found them to be one and a half metres deep, sprawling over a single piece of ground one hundred and fifty metres in diameter and bolstered with camouflaged bunkers. Angolan civilians had also resided in them. According to their accounts the particular base had been constructed three months prior. Male PLAN recruits tended to their fields by day and returned to sleep in bunkers by night.|$|E
