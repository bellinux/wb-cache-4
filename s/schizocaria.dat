5000|$|In psychiatry, catastrophic {{schizophrenia}} or <b>schizocaria</b> is an obsolete [...] {{term for}} a rare and acute form of schizophrenia leading directly to a severe and unremitting chronic psychosis (the long term occurrence of psychosis) and deterioration of the personality. Catastrophic schizophrenia {{was thought to be}} the most severe subtype of schizophrenia, as it had [...] "an acute onset and rapid decline into a chronic state without remission". [...] Catastrophic schizophrenia was also referred to as <b>schizocaria,</b> which was defined by Gerhard Mauz as a psychosis that caused the absolute destruction of the core of one's being.The term [...] "catastrophic schizophrenia" [...] has fallen out of use due to a number of reasons, including advances in psychiatric treatment, which led to a significant decline in patients that fit the diagnosis as their symptoms did not reach the severity of catastrophic schizophrenia, along with modern refinement of the definition and subtypes of schizophrenia. [...] This term has not been included in any version of the DSM. In modern terms, catastrophic schizophrenia would likely be defined as 'acute-onset chronic schizophrenia with poor prognosis'.|$|E
