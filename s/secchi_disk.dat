25|$|Limnology is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk,</b> a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.|$|E
500|$|Nutrients such as {{phosphorus}} {{and forms}} of nitrogen are essential for plants, yet excess amounts can result in lower dissolved oxygen. The EPA found the phosphorus concentration in Lake James ranged from 0.013 to 0.219 milligrams per liter, and averaged 0.040.

40|$|Three student interns from Sisseton Wahpeton College {{and their}} advisor Karla Witt worked with {{researchers}} from South Dakota State University {{to explore the}} hypothesis that satellite imagery {{could be used as}} a tool to evaluate water quality in lakes on the Sisseton Wahpeton Reservation. Interns constructed their own <b>Secchi</b> <b>disks</b> and used them to measure transparency in lakes and mark the locations with a global positioning system (GPS) on days when satellite imagery was available. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to relate field measurements to satellite images. The students also conducted monthly water quality sampling on Pickerel, Enemy Swim and Clear Lakes to determine current trophic state. Existing land use maps for Pickerel Lake were updated, ground truthed and compared to satellite imagery. Satellite imagery was then used to classify land use for portions of the Clear Lake watershed. The students also learned data analysis and presentation techniques by working with satellite imagery, water quality measurements, and climate and hydrologic data. The students contributed to the knowledge base that will eventually allow researchers to relate land use to water quality in lakes on the Sisseton Wahpeton Reservation. |$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:- The {{water quality}} in eight small {{reservoirs}} (0. 065 - 0. 249 km 2) {{in both the}} rugged escarpment landscape above the rift valley floor and the stepped plateau above them were studied between 1998 and 2000. Water transparency was measured using a 20 cm <b>Secchi</b> visibility <b>disk.</b> Total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (specific conductance) with temperature compensation at 25 oC were recorded in situ from a portable Jenway probe model 4075. Water pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), percentage oxygen saturation (POS) were recorded on site from a portable WTW probe model ProfiLine Oxi 197 / 197 -S. The overall range of mean water pH was 7. 0 – 8. 4 while the overall range of mean TDS was 29 - 82 mg/l. The TDS was slightly higher in the plateau reservoirs. The overall range of specific conductance was 37 - 101 µS/cm. The range of TDS and specific conductance in the reservoirs was quite low compared to other reservoirs in Kenya. The mean range of dissolved oxygen and percentage oxygen saturation was 2. 0 - 7. 2 mg/l, 23. 4. 2 - 33. 6 %, respectively. The level of dissolved oxygen was quite low in most reservoirs with dry season hypolimnial oxygen deficits in some sites and higher dissolved oxygen content in the more transparent reservoirs. The summary results showed a clear difference in water quality between the plateau and escarpment reservoirs in the study area. The water quality in the reservoirs {{was found to be}} suitable for domestic and livestock utilization. However, additional water quality parameters are required to confirm this conclusion. The reservoirs were found to possess a good potential for multipurpose development. KEY WORDS: Water pH, TDS, dissolved oxygen, reservoir utilizatio...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> was a {{plain white}} disk {{and it was}} used in the Mediterranean Sea. [...] Today, a plain white, 30 cm diameter <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> remains the standard design used in marine studies. In 1899 George C. Whipple modified the original all-white <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> to “…a disc about 8 inches in diameter, divided into quadrants painted alternately black and white like the target of a level-rod…”.

50|$|A 2010 study {{published}} in Nature reported that marine phytoplankton had declined substantially in the world's oceans over the past century. Phytoplankton concentrations in surface waters were estimated to have decreased by about 40% since 1950, {{at a rate of}} around 1% per year, possibly in response to ocean warming. The study generated debate among scientists and led to several communications and criticisms, also published in Nature. In a 2014 follow-up study, the authors used a larger database of measurements and revised their analysis methods to account for several of the published criticisms, but ultimately reached similar conclusions to the original Nature study. These studies and the need to understand the phytoplankon in the ocean {{led to the creation of}} the <b>Secchi</b> <b>Disk</b> Citizen Science study in 2013. The <b>Secchi</b> <b>Disk</b> study is a global study of phytoplankton conducted by seafarers (sailors, anglers, divers) involving a <b>Secchi</b> <b>Disk</b> and a smartphone app.|$|E
50|$|The {{transparency}} of the water, which determines {{the depth of}} the photic zone, is measured simply with a <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk.</b> It may also be measured with a photometer lowered into the water.|$|E
50|$|Water quality {{monitoring}} data has been collected since 1974, including 29 years of <b>secchi</b> <b>disk</b> transparencies, 23 years of total phosphorus (TP) data, 20 years of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data and 7 years of dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles. Sampling results from Station 1 (1974-2008) show a median TP concentration of 6.4 {{parts per billion}} (ppb), a mean <b>secchi</b> <b>disk</b> transparency of 9.2 m, and a mean Chl-a concentration of 1.2 ppb. The data indicates that Great East Lake is a high quality water by both the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services standards.|$|E
50|$|Water {{clarity in}} the lake is low, with <b>secchi</b> <b>disk</b> {{measurements}} averaging less than 3 meters. Fish {{in the lake}} that are of interest to anglers include smallmouth bass, white perch, chain pickerel, landlocked salmon, and brook trout.|$|E
50|$|Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and {{the ocean}} can be {{measured}} using a <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk.</b> This black and white disk is lowered into the water until {{it can no longer}} be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the euphotic zone with a 3-fold division of the Secchi depth, however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} device, {{which may}} help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube. The turbidity tube condenses {{water in a}} graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since 1962, at Heligoland {{roadstead}} , phytoplankton {{and water}} samples are taken every weekday morning, the turbidity is measured (e.g. using a <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk)</b> and other parameters are recorded. The North Sea warmed by 1.65 °C {{since the start}} of the time series.|$|E
50|$|The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has {{rated the}} water quality of Sheepscot Pond as average, with total {{phosphorus}} concentrations of 5-10 parts per billion, and no significant positive or negative trend in <b>Secchi</b> <b>Disk</b> Transparencies. The lake provides water for the Palermo Fish Cultural Station.|$|E
50|$|<b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> {{measurements}} do {{not indicate}} how attenuation changes with depth or particular wavelengths of light.

50|$|During this period, {{five years}} of basic {{chemical}} information was collected, in addition to 8 years of <b>Secchi</b> <b>Disk</b> Transparencies (SDT).

The potential for nuisance algal blooms on Schoodic Lake is low.|$|E
50|$|Kasshabog Lake has soft, {{slightly}} {{acidic water}} with a moderately low amount of apparent colour. The hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity levels indicate the lake is well mixed. Thermal stratification (temperature layers) were found in almost all the bays and monitoring stations.

50|$|Horn Pond {{water quality}} {{monitoring}} has been collected since 1982.

50|$|The {{complexity}} of water quality {{as a subject}} {{is reflected in the}} many types of measurements of water quality indicators. The most accurate measurements of water quality are made on-site, because water exists in equilibrium with its surroundings. Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, oxygen reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, and <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> depth.|$|E
50|$|Because Lake George {{exhibits}} {{very clear}} conditions, {{it may be}} more prone to the spread of milfoil to deeper water. The average <b>Secchi</b> <b>disk</b> transparency from 2000 -2005 ranged from 9.0 - 11.5 feet (CLMP data). With the clear water, light can penetrate into deeper waters and promote plant growth beyond the 15’ depth. Milfoil was recorded on the data sheets only if it was found at the survey point.|$|E
