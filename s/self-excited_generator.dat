40|$|A simple {{scheme for}} {{generation}} of heat from windpower is explored, {{based on a}} fixed-pitch turbine driving a series-wound <b>self-excited</b> <b>generator,</b> feeding a fixed, linear resistive load. A serious disadvantage is that almost immediately after stable self-excitation the damping ratio associated with perturbations from the equilibrium state falls off drastically with windspeed, so that the resulting cyclic variations in current and angular velocity would certainly be destructive. A non-linear resistive load is then synthesised, based on maximizing the equilibrium power extraction at any windspeed, {{and its effect on}} the dynamics is analysed. It is found that stable excitation now occurs at the minimum possible windspeed, and that the equilibrium state never changes its nature: it remains a well-damped stable node. Practical implementation of the non-linear load by modern power-electronics is suggested as a worthwhile task. ...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{squirrel-cage}} induction {{machines in}} wind generation is widely {{accepted as a}} generator of choice. The squirrel-cage induction machine is simple, reliable, cheap, lightweight, and requires very little maintenance. Generally, the induction generator {{is connected to the}} utility at constant frequency. With a constant frequency operation, the induction generator operates at practically constant speed (small range of slip). The wind turbine operates in optimum efficiency only within a small range of wind speed variation. The variable-speed operation allows an increase in energy captured and reduces both the torque peaks in the drive train and the power fluctuations sent to the utility. In variable-speed operation, an induction generator needs an interface to convert the variable frequency output of the generator to the fixed frequency at the utility. This interface can be simplified by using a <b>self-excited</b> <b>generator</b> because a simple diode bridge is required to perform the ac/dc conversion. The subsequent dc/ac conversion can be performed using different techniques. The use of a thyristor bridge is readily available for large power conversion and has a lower cost and higher reliability. The firing angle of the inverter bridge can be controlled to track the optimum power curve of the wind turbine. With only diodes and thyristors used in power conversion, the system can be scaled up to a very high voltage and high power applications.
