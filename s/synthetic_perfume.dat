25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfume</b> raw materials, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E

[...] The common name [...] "" [...] comes from a sixteenth-century marquis of the noble family in Italy who claimed to invent a plumeria-scented perfume, but in reality made a <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfume</b> that was said at the time to resemble the odor of the recently discovered flowers.

25|$|Certain {{chemicals}} {{found in}} perfume are often toxic, {{at least for}} small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfumes</b> and has insect repellent property.|$|R
50|$|ECOCERT is a {{voluntary}} standard, which certifies cosmetics products, attesting {{to the natural}} origin of the product. ECOCERT is present in more than 80 countries, performing the regular inspection and certification of eco-products. In order to earn a certificate, the product must contain at least 95% natural ingredients. The remaining 5% of ingredients are strictly regulated, monitoring the presence of minerals, organic acids, and other materials. A minimum of 95% of the plant-based ingredients (for example, plant extracts and vegetable oils) must be biologically certified. ECOCERT prohibits the use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfumes,</b> <b>synthetic</b> preservatives (for example, parabens), mineral oil, propylene glycol, and other synthetic raw materials.|$|R
40|$|We {{prepared}} O/W emulsion {{composed of}} a <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfume,</b> n-dodecane, protoporphyrin IX disodium salt (PpIX- 2 Na), sodium dodecyl sulfate, and water and investigated oxidative decomposition of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfume</b> in the emulsion and change in {{the stability of the}} emulsion by singlet oxygen (1 O 2) generated by photosensitization of PpIX- 2 Na. We used eugenol, linalool, benzyl acetate, α-ionone, α-hexylcinnamaldehyde, and d-limonene as a <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfume.</b> The stability of the O/W emulation including eugenol and linalool significantly decreased with increasing light irradiation time. The decrease in the emulsion stability may be attributable to oxidative decomposition of eugenol and linalool by 1 O 2 and enlargement of the oil droplet size...|$|E
50|$|Much modern potpourri {{consists}} of any decoratively shaped dried plant material (not necessarily from scented plants) with strong natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfumes</b> (and also often colored dyes) added, {{with the scent}} often bearing {{no relation to the}} plant material used. Sometimes, items that do not originate from plants are mixed in with the potpourri, to give it bulk and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It is possible to spray scents onto potpourri, however a fixative is needed so that the scent is absorbed for slow release. Generally, orris root is used for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|Myrcene can be {{efficiently}} and selectively oxidized by dioxygen in {{glacial acetic acid}} containing LiCl, {{in the presence of}} the PdC 2 -CuCl 2 catalytic combination, yielding two isomers of a new functionalized monoterpene, i. e., 3 -(1 -acetoxy- 1 -methylethyl) - 1 -vinylcyclopentene and 4 -(1 -acetoxy- 1 -methylethyl) - 1 -vinylcyclopentene, as major products. These compounds have a pleasant scent with a flower or fruit tinge and could be used as components of <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfumes.</b> The activities of Pd(OAc) (2) -LiNO 3, Pd(OAc) (2) -Cu(NO 3) (2) and Pd(OAc) (2) -benzoquinone systems in myrcene oxidation have also been examined.

50|$|Production of {{artificial}} manufactured fertilizer for agriculture was pioneered by Sir John Lawes at his purpose-built Rothamsted Research facility. In the 1840s he established large works near London for {{the manufacture of}} superphosphate of lime. Processes for the vulcanization of rubber were patented by Charles Goodyear in the United States and Thomas Hancock in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by William Henry Perkin in London. He partly transformed aniline into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first <b>synthetic</b> <b>perfumes.</b> However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 {{percent of the world}} supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. In the United States, Herbert Henry Dow's use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from brine was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.|$|R

25|$|Many modern {{perfumes}} contain synthesized odorants. Synthetics {{can provide}} fragrances {{which are not}} found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary <b>perfumes.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and coumarin are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically salicylates) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> musks are <b>perfuming</b> agents {{which are}} widely used in {{consumer}} products such as personal care items and household cleaners. Nowadays, in Europe, polycyclic musks like galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) are being used extensively. Products consumed in high volumes such as synthetic musks are continuously discharged via sewers into treatment plants where they are not completely eliminated. They reach {{the rest of the}} aquatic environment, increasing then concerns about their potential human and wildlife health risks. The presence of musk xylene (MX) in water was first reported in Japan (Yamagishi et al. 1981), then occurrence in Europe in water and fish was first reported in 1994 by Eschke (2004). Since there is no occurrence data about musks in France, this study intended to investigate the presence of synthetic musks in surface water from the Loire-Bretagne basin. A liquid liquid extraction method was applied to extract nitro musks (musk xylene and musk ketone) and polycyclic musks (AHTN, HHCB, phantolide (AHMI), traseolide (ATII), and celestolide (ADBI)) from water sample; analysis was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The quantification limit was 30 ng. l- 1 fo...|$|R
