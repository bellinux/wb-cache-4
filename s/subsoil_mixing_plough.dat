40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) is a {{heterogeneous}} mixture of or-ganic compounds that {{plays an important}} role in the movement of DOM-associated pollutants. In this study, transport and fractionation of DOM in soils was investigated in flow-through soil columns. Dissolved organic matter derived from spent mushroom substrate weathering was pumped through packed columns (2. 5 cm x 10 cm) comprising a coarse-loamy <b>subsoil</b> (<b>mixed,</b> semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludult), and effluents were monitored for changes in the composition of DOM. Effluent DOM was characterized for WV absorbance, molecular weight, acidity, and hy-drophilicity. Transport through the columns resulted in preferential re-tention of specific DOM constituents as indicated by comparison with a Br- tracer. During the transport process, effluent DOM exhibited de-creasing values of E 2 /E 3 (from 10. 3 to 6. 2), acidity (from 20. 8 to 13. 1 mmolc g-J C), and hydrophilicity (39. 0 to 28. 4 %), and increasing values of molar absorptivity (from 164 to 310 L molVIC cm- 1) and number an...|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Nancy Holt was {{commissioned}} {{to do two}} works {{on the grounds of}} Miami University in Ohio, Polar Circle and Star-Crossed. Polar Circle was destroyed not long afterwards, apparently by accident, by the University grounds crew. Star-Crossed survived, but is in a degraded state, and is officially closed (as a sign next to the sculpture indicates). The piece is made primarily of earth, originally mounded to a height of 14 feet, covering two concrete tubes, one aligned north-south and the other east-west, held in place by a buried steel frame. Until recently, the grounds crew of the University has been attempting to maintain it as part of the landscaping of the property, and it has not been treated as an artwork with special conservatorial needs. Some years ago, due to insufficient irrigation, the grass covering died, and the soil, thus exposed to erosion, slowly slumped down the steep slopes. The sculpture was rebuilt, but with the existing clay <b>subsoil</b> <b>mixed</b> into the topsoil, making for a less resilient form.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that calcium (Ca²⁺) plays an {{important}} role in binding organic matter to clay. However, most previous studies were conducted with either topsoil or pure aluminosilicates. Less is known about the effect of Ca²⁺ on binding of organic matter to clay-rich subsoils, which have lower organic-matter contents than topsoils, and their clays are more strongly weathered than pure aluminosilicates. Two experiments were conducted with a Vertisol subsoil (69 % clay) : a laboratory incubation and a batch sorption. The mineral substrate in the incubation experiment was pure sand alone or sand amended with 300 g clay kg⁻¹. Powdered calcium sulfate (CaSO 4) at rates of 0, 5, 10, and 15 g Ca kg⁻¹ and mature wheat residue at a rate of 20 g kg⁻¹ were added to this mineral substrate and the water content was adjusted to 70 % of water-holding capacity. Carbon dioxide release was measured for 28 days. Cumulative respiration per g soil organic carbon (C) (SOC from clay and residues) was increased by clay addition. Increasing Ca²⁺ addition rate decreased cumulative respiration in the sand with clay but had no effect on respiration in the pure sand. Clay and Ca²⁺ addition had no significant effect on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) per g SOC but clay addition reduced the concentration of potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4) –extractable C per g SOC. For the batch sorption experiment, the <b>subsoil</b> was <b>mixed</b> with 0 to 15 g Ca kg⁻¹ and water-extractable organic C (WEOC) derived from mature wheat straw was added at 0, 1485, 3267, and 5099 mg WEOC kg⁻¹. Increasing Ca²⁺ addition rate increased sorption of WEOC, particularly at the greatest concentration of WEOC added, and decreased desorption. This study confirmed the importance of Ca²⁺ in binding organic matter to clay and suggests that Ca²⁺ addition to clay-rich subsoils could be used to increase their organic C sequestration. P.

40|$|Eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides L., {{has been}} {{reported}} to tolerate a wide variety of soil conditions, including drought, flooding, and acidity, but its specific tolerance to aluminum (Al) has not been tested. One strain of this species, PMK Select Lot 94 SFG- 1, was tested for its tolerance to excess Al in an acid, Al-toxic Tatum <b>subsoil</b> (clayey, <b>mixed,</b> thermic, Typic Hapludult) and in nutrient solutions containing Al. Roots were able to penetrate unfertilized Tatum subsoil at pH levels as low as 4. 1 - 4. 2 (1 : 1 soil-water), at Al saturations of 64 to 77 % of CEC, and to tolerate Al concentrations in nutrient solution that would be lethal for many crop plants. For example, with 4 mg Al L- 1 and a final solution pH of 4. 67, shoot and root dry weights were 75 and 76 %, respectively, of those with no Al. Even with 24 mg Al L- 1 and a final solution pH of 4. 13, shoot and root dry weights were 45 and 46 %, respectively, of those for the no Al check treatment. Hence, this strain of gamagrass shows promise for use on soils having acidic, Al-toxic subsoil layers that act as root barriers and predispose plants to injury by drought. Roots of gamagrass are also reported to penetrate hard clay pans and to create root channels for subsequent crops that lack this ability. Current studies indicate that the strain tested was susceptible to a chlorosis resembling iron (Fe) deficiency when grown in a Jiffy Mix potting mixture or with excess Al in nutrient solutions. Hence, gamagrass is tentatively being classified as a calcifuge [Al tolerant-Fe-inefficient]. In the current experiment, considerable plant to plant variability was noted regarding susceptibility to this chlorosis factor and to a purpling symptom resembling phosphorus (P) deficiency. Results indicate that an exhaustive screening of gamagrass populations could identify strains that are more suitable for specific soil situations...|$|R
40|$|Prydz Bay and the Mac. Robertson Land Shelf exhibit {{many of the}} {{variations}} seen on Antarctic continental shelves. The Mac. Robertson shelf is relatively narrow with rugged, inner-shelf topography and shallow outer-shelf banks swept by the west-flowing Antarctic Coastal Current. U-shaped valleys cut across the shelf. It has thin sedimentary cover, deposited and eroded by cycles of glacial advance and retreat through the Neogene and Quaternary. Modern sedimentation is diatom-rich siliceous, muddy ooze in shelf deeps, while, on the banks, phytodetritus, calcareous bioclasts and terrigenous material are <b>mixed</b> by iceberg <b>ploughing.</b> Prydz Bay is a large embayment fed by the Amery Ice Shelf. It has a broad inner-shelf deep area and outer bank, with depths ranging from 2400 m beneath the ice shelf to 100 m on the outer banks. A clockwise gyre flows through the bay. Fine mud and siliceous ooze drape the seafloor; however, banks are scoured by icebergs to depths as great as 500 m. The Mac.

40|$|Furnas Volcano (Sao Miguel Island, Azores) is a steep-sided {{caldera complex}} {{resulting}} from several collapses. In this paper, we analyse {{and interpret the}} gravity survey {{carried out by the}} Institute de Astronomia y Geodesia (Spain) and the gravity data published by the Institute Nacional de Meteorologia e Geofisica (Portugal). The resulting Bouguer anomaly reveals the presence of a regional trend, several local features and a component of noise. In separating the regional trend we use a robust polynomial fitting. Further, a covariance analysis and a least squares prediction are applied to filter the noise and to model the local anomaly. ii first signal map represents the main local anomaly, while the secondary signal map shows superficial anomalies. This distribution reveals a local main minimum close to the 1630 A. D. and Gaspar craters. Several possible alignments are shown that lead to a model, mainly with SW-NE and SE-MY orientations, of the negative anomaly, with the pattern of the low density zones showing a relationship with the volcanic features. Applying a stabilized Linear method of gravimetric inversion, we obtain a density contrast distribution of the sources of the filtered local Bouguer anomaly, considering as unknowns the anomalous densities of a fixed discrete distribution of rectangular prisms which represents the <b>subsoil</b> volume. A <b>mixed</b> minimization criteria for the weighted residuals and the weighted density contrast allow us to obtain a solution as a discrete three-dimensional density contrast model. The obtained anomalous densities model shows a clear relation with the structure of the caldera complex and tectonic trends, with the principal body of negative contrast density being associated with the subsurface structure of the caldera.

40|$|No-tillage (NT) practice, where straw is {{retained}} on {{the soil}} surface, is increasingly being used in cereal cropping systems in Australia and elsewhere. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), where straw is <b>mixed</b> with the <b>ploughed</b> soil, NT practice may reduce straw decomposition, increase nitrogen immobilisation and increase organic carbon in the soil. This study examined 15 N-labelled wheat straw (stubble) decomposition in four treatments (NT v. CT, with N rates of 0 and 75 kg/ha. year) and assessed the tillage and fertiliser N effects on mineral N and organic C and N levels over a 10 -year period in a field experiment. NT practice decreased the rate of straw decomposition while fertiliser N application increased it. However, there was no tillage practice x N interaction. The mean residence time of the straw N in soil was {{more than twice as}} long under the NT (1. 2 years) as compared to the CT practice (0. 5 years). In comparison, differences in mean residence time due to N fertiliser treatment were small. However, tillage had generally very little effect on either the amounts of mineral N at sowing or soil organic C (and N) over the study period. While application of N fertiliser increased mineral N, it had very little effect on organic C over a 10 -year period. Relatively rapid decomposition of straw and short mean residence time of straw N in a Vertisol is likely to have very little long-term effect on N immobilisation and organic C level in an annual cereal cropping system in a subtropical, semiarid environment. Thus, changing the tillage practice from CT to NT may not necessitate additional N requirement unless use is made of additional stored water in the soil or mineral N loss due to increased leaching is compensated for in N supply to crops...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{soils are}} a large source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Soil mesofaunal species can accelerate, delay, {{increase}} or decrease N 2 O emissions. However, it is still unknown whether the soil fauna affect N 2 O emissions through trophic interactions or through their effect on soil structure. We explored the role of these two pathways in a 70 day microcosm experiment with a sandy loam <b>subsoil</b> with hay <b>mixed</b> in. Enchytraeids, fungivorous mites and predatory mites {{were added to the}} soil in a full factorial design to test for both single species effects as well as interactions between species. We measured N 2 O and CO 2 fluxes and we analysed soil structural parameters using X-ray micro tomography. After 35 days of incubation, enchytraeid presence significantly increased the volumetric air content of the soil (0. 049 – 0. 067 cm 3 cm− 3, P = 0. 010) as well as the abundance of pores with sizes similar to their body width. At the same time N 2 O emissions, −NO 3 NO 3 − and DOC concentrations were significantly higher when enchytraeids were present (3. 6 to 8. 4 mg N 2 O-N m− 2, P < 0. 001; 6. 0 to 17. 1 mg −NO 3 -NNO 3 −-N kg− 1 soil, P < 0. 001; 121. 1 to 135. 6 mg C kg− 1 soil, and P = 0. 017, respectively). Neither fungivorous mites nor predatory mites nor their interactions had a significant effect on soil structure or N 2 O emissions. Enchytraeids accelerated peak N 2 O emissions (P = 0. 001), but did not increase cumulative N 2 O emissions on day 70. Structural equation modelling confirmed that enchytraeids enhanced nitrogen mineralisation directly and also indirectly by creating a higher volumetric air content, and thereby increased N 2 O emissions. We conclude that the soil structure pathway was important in driving N 2 O emissions, and that soil ecosystem engineers such as enchytraeids disproportionately affected N 2 O emissions as compared to other soil fauna...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} in the tropics favor the formation of polar polycyclic aromatic compound (polar PACs, such as oxygenated PAHs [OPAHs] and azaarenes [AZAs]), but {{little is known about}} these hazardous compounds in tropical soils. The objectives of this work were to determine (i) the level of contamination of soils (0 – 5 and 5 – 10 cm layers) from the tropical metropolis of Bangkok (Thailand) with OPAHs and AZAs and (ii) the influence of urban emission sources and soil properties on the distribution of PACs. We hypothesized that the higher solar insolation and microbial activity in the tropics than in the temperate zone will lead to enhanced secondary formation of OPAHs. Hence, OPAH to related parent-PAH ratios will be higher in the tropical soils of Bangkok than in temperate soils of Bratislava and Gothenburg. The concentrations of ∑ 15 OPAHs (range: 12 – 269 ng g− 1) and ∑ 4 AZAs (0. 1 – 31 ng g− 1) measured in soils of Bangkok were lower than those in several cities of the industrialized temperate zone. The ∑ 15 OPAHs (r = 0. 86, p < 0. 01) and ∑ 4 AZAs (r = 0. 67, p < 0. 01) correlated significantly with those of ∑ 20 PAHs highlighting similar sources and related fate. The octanol–water partition coefficient did not explain the transport to the <b>subsoil,</b> indicating soil <b>mixing</b> as the reason for the polar PAC load of the lower soil layer. Data on PAC concentrations in soils of Bratislava and Gothenburg were taken from published literature. The individual OPAH to parent-PAH ratios in soils of Bangkok were mostly higher than those of Bratislava and Gothenburg (e. g. 9 -fluorenone/fluorene concentration ratio was 12. 2 ± 6. 7, 5. 6 ± 2. 4, and 0. 7 ± 02 in Bangkok, Bratislava and Gothenburg soils, respectively) supporting the view that tropical environmental conditions and higher microbial activity likely lead to higher OPAH to parent-PAH ratios in tropical than in temperate soils...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} plays {{a central role}} for the global and {{especially}} for the terrestrial carbon cycle. As a result of climate problems, due to the significant increase of greenhouse gases (e. g. CO 2), suitable possibilities are needed to regulate the global carbon cycle. Especially the terrestrial part of the global carbon cycle seems to be suitable for regulative interventions. Until now, there is rare knowledge, which mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} fixation and mobilisation of carbon in soils. In this study, the unanswered questions shall be discussed to make recommendations, which measures can be forced in order to increase soil carbon pools sustainably. Analyses in this study were performed on soil and plant samples of several long-term agricultural trials of either urban (Halle/Saale, Germany) or rural areas (e. g. Rotthalmünster, Germany). Within the enforcement of this study a lot of new findings were made concerning the dynamics of carbon in agro ecosystems of temperate climates. The most important results are as follows: i. A reproducible, inexpensive, automated and fast extraction and separation procedure for soil lipids was successfully adopted and optimised. ii. Long-chain n-carboxylic acids were found to be best suitable for the molecular differentiation between cereal crops following distinct photosynthesis pathways (C 3 - and C 4 -plants) and the corresponding monoculture cropped soils. Alkanes and short-chain carboxylic acids are only of limited use for the differentiation between these plant types. This is due to similar distribution patterns in both plant types. Additionally, other sources of short-chain carboxylic acids in soils, like bacteria and fungi as well as fossil sources of alkanes like brown coal with similar distribution patterns, make it difficult to use these compounds as differentiation parameters. iii. As determined with the use of archived arable soil samples, significant soil carbon modifications {{as a result of the}} atmospheric Suess effect, like isotopic changes and amount of biomass incorporation, are expectable in the medium-term in arable soils. Suess effect induced modifications of soils mainly depend on amounts of biomass incorporation in soils and tillage practises applied. Within a few years of practising or low biomass incorporation these effects can be determined poorly, because marginal modifications in soil management, e. g. ploughing depth variations, may overlay modifications caused by the Suess effect in short periods. iv. For the first time turnover times of several individual lipids and lipid fractions were determined in this study. Within a few decades (20 - 60 years) lipids are turned over in agricultural soils, while bulk carbon is turned over significantly slower. Determined turnover times based on stable and radioactive carbon isotopes could be compared hardly, because low contributions of fossil 14 C-free carbon cause high turnover times, when applying the radioactive method. For soils of the low contaminated Rotthalmünster site several lipid fractions like carboxylic acids showed similar turnover times based on stable (27 years) and radioactive (42 years) carbon isotopes. Hence, especially carboxylic acids can be classified as an uncontaminated lipid fraction, yielding realistic turnover times for predominantly plant-derived and microbial organic matter. Especially the alkane fraction, which is widely used for the calculation of new carbon proportions and source apportionment of C 3 - and C 4 -plant-derived organic matter, show high 14 C ages resulting by pollution with fossil carbon (e. g. fossil fuel burning or direct input of oil and brown coal dust) for rural sites, too. Thus, alkanes can be used for turnover time calculations only with care. Additionally, actual contributions of different plant compartments to soil organic matter and their isotopic compositions directly before harvest are required for realistic turnover time determinations on a molecular level. Otherwise major errors could not be avoided. v. In contrast to previous determinations for lipids in peaty and acidic soils, lipids were found to be less stable in agricultural soils. Generally, lipids are part of the intermediate stable carbon pool in soils. As demonstrated for bulk agricultural soils, incorporation and turnover of carbon mainly depends on soil management like tillage and biomass contribution. In tilled agricultural soils a fast turnover is expectable due to annual <b>mixing</b> of the <b>ploughed</b> horizon with surficial plant residues. Contrastingly, in soils with high biomass contributions and surficial tillage, a carbon and lipid enrichment can be expected, similar to grassland or forest soils. Summarizing, sustainable management of agricultural soils in combination with large biomass contributions may lead to an increasing fixation of carbon and lipids in soils...|$|R
