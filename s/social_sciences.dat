40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> as {{a school}} subject aims at making {{students}} knowledgeable in societal issues as well as preparing them for citizenship. Despite the strong position of <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> in the Swedish school curricula {{little research has been}} done in the field. Previous research has mainly concentrated on factual knowledge and conceptual learning, or the role of deliberation in class activities. Less research has focused on the role of disciplinary thinking and how that might promote learning how to think like a social scientist {{and at the same time}} prepare students for citizenship. By using a conceptual framework from history didactics <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> education is explored in search of second-order concepts. Also, the relationship between these concepts and democratic socialisation is investigated. By focusing on one substantial case, globalisation, this study tries to reach beyond the various topics commonly covered in <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> education. This was done by observations of teaching in <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> and interviews with six experienced teachers. Manifested in the teachers’ voices were ideas on how to organise, analyse, interpret and critically review discourses in society. The proposed second order concepts of <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> found in the teachers’ voices were: <b>social</b> <b>science</b> perspectives, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> causality, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> evidence and inference, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> abstraction, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> comparison and contrast, and the evaluative dimension of <b>social</b> <b>science.</b> In order to reach their goals in <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> the teachers underlined the importance of using these concepts. When pupils work scientifically they develop a way of thinking about society and they challenge their set opinions about different topics. Therefore, second order concepts are important for learning <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> and at the same time preparing students for a life as citizens...|$|R

40|$|Faculty in college-level <b>social</b> <b>science</b> {{and public}} policy courses rarely {{integrate}} systematic analysis of spatial dimensions of phenomena into their courses or teach students to use GIS software to get answers to <b>social</b> <b>science</b> {{and public policy}} questions. Spatial analysis is entirely absent from most <b>social</b> <b>science</b> and public policy research methods courses. But space matters in the issues political scientists, economists, urban planners, public administrators and other social scientists and public policy professionals study. Spatially integrated <b>social</b> <b>science</b> seeks to correct this shortcoming by integrating spatial concepts and GIS operations into <b>social</b> <b>science</b> courses. This paper describes current efforts to help <b>social</b> <b>science</b> faculty integrate spatial analysis into their teaching and an instructional module the author has developed to teach upper division undergraduate <b>social</b> <b>science</b> students to think spatially, visualize data, and use GIS operations to solve <b>social</b> <b>science</b> and public policy problems.

The benefits of such interaction and interdisciplinarity are outlined in relation to a recently completed project using multi-methods, which resulted in the production of a professional short film.

5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the <b>social</b> <b>sciences.</b> According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E
