50|$|The {{first point}} {{concerns}} the liberalisation of visas between the EU and the Western Balkans. The Italian Government hopes that liberalisation can begin between late 2009 and early 2010, with priority {{being given to}} Serbia and Macedonia. The second point calls upon the European Commission to prepare a technical report on Montenegro’s accession to EU, which {{will be followed by}} those of Serbia and Albania, while the third point urges completion of Croatia’s EU accession process by the end of 2010. The fourth point regards strengthening the role of the EU High Representative for Bosnia Herzegovina Valentin Inzko. The fifth calls for the entrance into effect of the Association and <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Agreement</b> with Serbia, which, in turn, is to collaborate fully with the Hague Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The sixth point calls for the rapid resolution of the dispute putting Skopje against Athens over the name “Macedonia”. The seventh point concerns Italy’s insistence on the importance of economic support for the young Republic of Kosovo. The Eighth point requests for an EU-Balkans summit, enlarged to the United States, to be held by mid-2010.|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is developed {{in which both}} buybacks and the adoption of an IMF programme {{can be used as}} screening devices which enable a creditor to discriminate between debtor countries which are willing to use debt relief in order to invest and repay and countries which are not. Asymmetric information is assumed. This problem can be solved if the country has su¢cient resources to engage in a debt buyback and so gain the debt relief. When the country is credit constrained (which seems more plausible), an alternative screening mechanism is to undertake an IMF programme in return for debt reduction and possibly an IMF loan. Since the inception of the developing countries debt crisis in 1982, agreement to follow an IMF approved programme has frequently been a formal prerequisite for a country to bene…t from debt relief and rescheduling negotiated through both Paris and London clubs. In particular, the Brady Plan deals were contingent on a satisfactory macroeconomic adjustment programme, typically {{in the form of an}} IMF <b>stabilisation</b> <b>agreement.</b> 1 The Brady deals involved a combination of an IMF agreement and debt and debt-service reduction from the banks. Considering the total amount of debt reduction (about 15...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{increasing}} attention has been placed on the occurrence and consequences of export instability. Thus far, however, research on this subject has produced diverse results. Disagreement has ranged from the choice of appropriate index, the relative incidence of export instability between advanced and developing countries, the causes of instability and finally its general economic effect. The present work summarises and takes stock of the views of professional economists to see, for example, whether proposals fro commodity price <b>stabilisation</b> <b>agreements</b> can be justified on pure economic criteria.

40|$|U Europskoj uniji državne su potpore nespojive s pravilima zajedničkog tržišta. Europska komisija ipak prihvaća neke iznimke. Regionalne su državne potpore jedna od njih. One se dodjeljuju radi poticanja gospodarskog razvoja manje razvijenih područja. Osnovni preduvjet za njihovu dodjelu je postojanje karte regionalnih potpora. Njome se utvrđuju područja na kojima se mogu dodjeljivati regionalne potpore te maksimalni intenzitet potpora. Sklapanjem Sporazuma o stabilizaciji i pridruživanju Hrvatska je preuzela obvezu uspostavljanja sustava nadzora i odobravanja državnih potpora koji je jednak onome Europske unije. Posebna Vladina radna skupina izradila je prijedlog odluke o karti regionalnih potpora. Agencija za zaštitu tržišnog natjecanja zajedno s Europskom komisijom ocijenit će podobnost prostornih jedinica za statistiku druge razine Republike Hrvatske (NUTS II) i predloženi intenzitet regionalnih potpora koji je utvrđen na temelju Smjernica Zajednice o nacionalnim regionalnim potporama za period 2007 – 2013. Nakon što taj postupak bude proveden, {{hrvatska}} Vlada će usvojiti odluku o karti regionalnih potpora Republike Hrvatske. In the European Union, state {{subsidies are}} in {{compatible with the}} common market. However, under certain conditions and in accordance with certain rules, the European Union accepts the exceptions to this general rule. Regional state subsidies {{are one of the}} exceptions. According to article 87 paragraph 3 subsection (a) and article 87 paragraph 3 subsection (b), they are granted with the purpose of stimulating the economic development of under developed regions within the European Union. The basic prerequisite for granting regional subsidies is the map of regional subsidies that defines the areas to which the subsidies are granted and their maximum amount. By signing the Association and <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the Republic of Croatia has taken over the obligation to establish a system of supervision and granting of the state subsidies equal to the state subsidies’ control system of the European Union. Following the Agreement, the Government of the Republic of Croatia has founded a Task Force in charge of creating the map of regional state subsidies, which has produced a draft decree. Under article 70 of the Agreement, draft decree of the regional subsidies map must be officially given to the Agency for the Protection of Market Competition. Supported by the European Commission, the Agency will assess the acceptability of the Croatian statistical second level territorial units (NUTS II) and the suggested intensity of regional subsidies determined according to the Community Guidelines on national regional subsidies for 2007 – 2013. After the procedure has been completed, the Government of the Republic of Croatia shall formally decide on the map of regional state subsidies of the Republic of Croati...|$|E

40|$|Commodity <b>stabilisation</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have often}} been {{suggested}} {{as a means of}} stabilising producers' revenues and redistributing productive resources to less developed economies (from "North" to "South"). But no empirical estimates of how much may be expected from such agreements, nor of what they would cost to operate, have appeared. This paper examines, in the context of one market, how far prices can be stabilised by buffer stock interventions, the costs of that stabilisation, and whether any redistribution would be achieved. We find pure stabilisation leads to transfers away from the South, but that supply restrictions which force redistribution are extremely expensive. However it is relatively cheap to protect producers in the South against the uncertainty of future revenues. Buffer Stocks; Commodity Stabilisation Schemes; North-South Models...|$|R
