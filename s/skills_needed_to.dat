5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, {{to give them an}} understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> oversee other workers.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> lead.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the LS books is to teach {{children}} the information and <b>skills</b> they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> live intelligent, responsible lives. This is accomplished by teaching children the personal <b>skills</b> they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take care of themselves, the social <b>skills</b> they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop and maintain positive relationships, and the coping <b>skills</b> they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> relate to things in positive rather than negative ways.|$|R
5000|$|Emerson co-wrote Zombie Economics with Lisa Desjardins, who is {{currently}} political director at PBS NewsHour. The book likens debt and financial problems to an invasion of zombies. Its premise is [...] "the theory that every <b>skill</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> survive an economic downturn mirrors a <b>skill</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> survive the zombie apocalypse." [...] Emerson {{got the idea for}} the book while having a dinner conversation with his wife about friends losing their jobs. [...] "The zombie metaphor" [...] popped into his head as an ideal way to convey the terror of facing financial ruin. Chapters include [...] "A Basement Full of Ammo" [...] and [...] "They'll Eat the Fat Ones First". The book was released on May 3, 2011.|$|R

5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s. The Kikuyu custom {{at the time was}} to divide boys into age groups, in which they would be initiated into manhood together. The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> herd the family flock. When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E

30|$|The results overall {{indicate}} that, {{regardless of}} tests {{and skills to}} measure, English proficiency as a general construct may determine the major portion of these scores.

25|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is the importance}} of leadership being able to communicate with the invasion force. In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were timely and followed, {{as in the case of}} Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE). At that time, the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> lead troops in battle were as important as the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> run a country during peacetime. When it was necessary for the king to be elsewhere, messengers would relay updates back to the rear, often on horseback or, in cases such as the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE), with swift runners.|$|E
