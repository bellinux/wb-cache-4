40|$|To {{understand}} and predict {{the behavior of}} others, people regularly reason about others' beliefs, goals, and intentions. People can even use this theory of mind recursively, and form beliefs about the way others in turn reason about the beliefs, goals, and intentions of others. Although the evolutionary origins of this cognitively demanding ability are unknown, the Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis suggests that higher-order theory of mind allows individuals to cooperate more effectively. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis through the Tacit Communication Game. In this game, two agents cooperate to set up novel communication in which a Sender agent communicates the goal to the Receiver agent. By simulating interactions between agents that differ in their theory of mind abilities, we determine to what extent higher orders of theory of mind help agents to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>communication.</b> Our results show that first-order and second-order theory of mind can allow agents to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>communication</b> more quickly, but also that the effectiveness of higher orders of theory of mind depends {{on the role of}} the agent.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of the servo system {{is dependent on the}} speed or band width of the closed loop control system. To achieve the high speed closed loop operation, hardware oriented control is preferred and it is achieved by means of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip). The servo system is used to drive a two axis robotic arm moving in a plane where two PMSM motor with servo control provides the required motion. Robotic applications require quick and accurate changes in driving torque so that the required motion behaviour is attained. Quick change in operating flux is required for fast and accurate servo control. Conventional scalar control drives cannot achieve quick response time and hence vector control is employed. The IRMCK 201 ASIC used in the application has the Vector Control algorithm hard wired into it for complete servo control of a single PMSM. It takes the position and current feed back by using shaft encoder, hall sensor and IR 2175 Current sensing IC.

40|$|Abstract — Our {{characterization}} of {{a suite of}} commercial and scientific workloads on a 16 -core cache-coherent chip multiprocessor (CMP) shows that overall system performance is sensitive to on-chip communication latency, and can degrade by 20 % or more due to long interconnect latencies. On the other hand, communication bandwidth demand is low. These results prompt us to explore circuitswitched networks. Circuit-switched networks can significantly lower the communication latency between processor cores, when compared to packet-switched networks, since once circuits are <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>communication</b> latency approaches pure interconnect delay. However, if circuits are not frequently reused, the long setup time can hurt overall performance, as is demonstrated by the poor performance of traditional circuit-switched networks – all applications saw a slowdown rather than a speedup with a traditional circuitswitched network. To combat this problem, we propose hybrid circuit switching (HCS), a network design which removes the circuit setup time overhead by intermingling packet-switched flits with circuit-switched flits. Additionally, we co-design a prediction-based coherence protocol that leverages the existence of circuits to optimize pair-wise sharing between cores. The protocol allows pair-wise sharers to communicate directly with each other via circuits and drives up circuit reuse. Circuit-switched coherence provides up to 23 % savings in network latency which leads to an overall system performance improvement of up to 15 %. In short, we show HCS delivering the latency benefits of circuit switching, while sustaining the throughput benefits of packet switching, in a design realizable with low area and power overhead.

40|$|Plenty of {{work was}} contributed {{in the field}} of {{protocol}} design and performance evaluation of multi-hop networks. It is generally accepted that mobility has a huge impact on the protocol performance; even more for multi-hop networks. Obtaining realistic measurements of mobility, however, is complex and expensive. Thus, we adopt virtual world scenarios to explore the mobility issue, by using the well-known multi-player game, Quake II. The advantage of the Quake II engine is that users move within virtual worlds under realistic constraints, whereas other mobility models may o#er insu#cient accuracy or operate under unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, it is very easy to create new virtual worlds and to adapt them to specialized needs. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for mobility measurements in virtual worlds that could be adopted for the design of communication protocols. Our framework enables the study of the impact of mobility on connectivity and stability of the network, giving useful insights for improving communication performance. An interesting application of our approach is the analysis of coverage extension of so called hotspots or emergency situations, where the fixed network infrastructure is insu#cient or non-existent. In these extreme cases, multi-hop networks can be used to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>communication</b> quickly.

This heterogeneous clustering approach has its own security measures in which only registered devices in the IP-DNS {{can be part of}} the heterogeneous clustering network and can <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>communication</b> channel with the sink or with any other device. We have also {{proposed a}} dynamic hierarchical clustering scheme in which certain number of sensor nodes that locates in specific area will be grouped as cluster and nominate a cluster head of their own. We have proposed two cluster head selection criteria. The fist one is edge sensors in which sensors that are closer to other clusters will be selected as cluster head whereas the second select the cluster head that has the minimum average hop distance to other sensors. We have seen that the second selection criteria leads to shorter path as the cluster heads {{are in the middle of}} cluster and closer to other nodes. We have compared our proposed architecture with other well known on demand routing protocol named as AODV and we have seen that our approach perform way better in terms of delay. Our approach can allow the usage of proactive protocols at each routing level and still have limited size of routing table at each node. The only trade off is that our approach has slightly longer path length compared to AODV. Furthermore, {{we proposed a}} hierarchical routing scheme in which sensor networks at each routing level is grouped and exchange routing information among themselves avoiding flooding the network with control over head messages...|$|E
