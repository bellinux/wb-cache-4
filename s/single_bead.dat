60|$|The {{business}} of exploration {{is about as}} romantic as earth-work on Indian railways. There are the same narrow-gauge trams and donkeys, the same shining gangs in the borrow-pits and the same skirling dark-blue crowds {{of women and children}} with the little earth-baskets. But the hoes are not driven in, nor the clods jerked aside at random, and when the work fringes along the base of some mighty wall, men use their hands carefully. A white man--or he was white at breakfast-time--patrols through the continually renewed dust-haze. Weeks may pass without a <b>single</b> <b>bead,</b> but anything may turn up at any moment, and it is his to answer the shout of discovery.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of pharmacologically promising compounds (lead compounds) from combinatorial libraries is frequently {{limited by the}} throughput of the analytical technique employed. Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) offers high sensitivity, mass accuracy (m/¢m> 500 000), and sequencing capabilities. A rapid and efficient method for high-throughput analysis of <b>single</b> <b>beads</b> from peptide-encoded combinatorial libraries with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry is presented. Encoding peptides on <b>single</b> <b>beads</b> are identified and structurally characterized by MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) and ultrahigh-resolution MALDI Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. A strategy of on-probe sample preparation is developed to minimize handling of the beads...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{approach in}} combinatorial chemistry is {{the synthesis of}} one-bead-one-compound peptide libraries. In contrast to synthesis and functional screening, which is performed in a largely automated manner, structure determination has been frequently laborious and time-consuming. Here we report an approach for de novo sequencing of peptides on <b>single</b> <b>beads</b> by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (MALDI-FTICR) tandem mass spectrometry, using a resin with a photolinker for solid-phase peptide synthesis. Upon sorting out <b>single</b> <b>beads,</b> an efficient sample preparation on the MALDI target was developed that enables fragmentation upon irradiation of the bead-matrix mixture with the ultraviolet (UV) -MALDI laser, with enhanced yield of sequence-specific fragment ions at increased laser energy. This approach is illustrated by sequence determinations of two peptides from a library with sequences varying in a single amino acid; the feasibility with tandem-MS procedures and fragment ion assignment was ascertained by sustained off-resonance irradiation/collision induced dissociation (SORI/CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) fragmentation...|$|R

50|$|A parallelized {{version of}} {{pyrosequencing}} {{was developed by}} 454 Life Sciences, which has since been acquired by Roche Diagnostics. The method amplifies DNA inside water droplets in an oil solution (emulsion PCR), with each droplet containing a single DNA template attached to a single primer-coated bead that then forms a clonal colony. The sequencing machine contains many picoliter-volume wells each containing a <b>single</b> <b>bead</b> and sequencing enzymes. Pyrosequencing uses luciferase to generate light for detection of the individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA, and the combined data are used to generate sequence reads. This technology provides intermediate read length and price per base compared to Sanger sequencing on one end and Solexa and SOLiD on the other.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} a novel method of microencapsulation with calcium alginate-chitosan and Eudragit S 100 nanoparticles for the improving viability of probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Extrusion technique {{was carried out}} in microencapsulation process. The viability of two probiotics in <b>single</b> coated <b>beads</b> (with only chitosan), double coated beads (with chitosan and Eudragit nanoparticles), and as free cells (unencapsulated) were conducted in simulated gastric juice (pH 1.55, without pepsin) followed by incubation in simulated intestinal juice (pH 7.5, with 1 % bile salt). In case of <b>single</b> coated <b>beads,</b> presumably, lack of sufficient strength of chitosan under simulated gastric condition was the main reason of 4 -log and 5 -log reduction of the counts of the L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus respectively. The results showed that with the second coat forming (Eudragit nanoparticles) over the first coat (chitosan), the strength of the beads and then viability rate of the bacteria were increased in comparison with the <b>single</b> coated <b>beads.</b>|$|R

Peter Filichia of The Star-Ledger suggested that show was better than Broadway stating: One reason “Hairspray” is more believable in Millburn is Christine Danelson.

50|$|Jōdo-shū is {{somewhat}} unusual {{because of the}} use of a double-ringed prayer beads used for nenbutsu (recitation of the name of a Buddha): one ring contains <b>single</b> <b>beads</b> used to count a single recitation while the other ring is used to count full revolutions of the first ring. Additionally, other beads hang from the strings, which can count full revolutions of the second ring (flat beads), or full revolutions of the first string of beads.

50|$|The cape {{was within}} a Bronze Age burial mound {{in a field}} named Bryn yr Ellyllon, the Fairies' or Goblins' Hill. The gold cape had {{been placed on the}} body of a person who was interred in a rough cist (stone-lined grave) within a burial mound.

An estimated 200-300 amber beads, in rows, were on the cape originally, but only a <b>single</b> <b>bead</b> survives at the British Museum. Also associated with the cape were remains of coarse cloth and 16 fragments of sheet bronze which are likely to have been the backing for the gold: in places the gold was riveted onto the bronze sheeting with bronze rivets. There also were two gold 'straps' among the artefacts found. An urn with large quantities of burnt bone and ash was 0.6-0.9 m from the grave.|$|E
