5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} levels of door {{protection}}. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} world, door swings, or handing, are {{determined}} while standing on the outside or less secure <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, {{but can be}} a pressure mat fitted on the swing <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.|$|E
25|$|For 250 {{years from}} 1434 the Sydenham family slowly created Brympton d'Evercy {{as it appears}} today. Each {{generation}} enlarged and altered the house according to whim or current fashion. The -long west front (pictured {{at the top of}} the page) was built in the late Tudor period. The two large windows either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> provide light for the double-height Great Hall, which was greatly increased in size by the new west front. The older north wing adjacent to the great hall probably contained the private rooms of its builder, John Sydenham.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as it is being closed.|$|E
25|$|The story then {{shifts to}} Susannah {{coming through the}} magic door to an {{alternate}} 1980s New York, where Gary Hart is president. Susannah throws away Roland's gun (which does not function on this <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door),</b> rejecting {{the life of a}} gunslinger, and starts a new life with alternate versions of Eddie and Jake, who in this world are brothers with the surname Toren. They have only very vague memories of their previous journey with Susannah, whose own memories of Mid-World are already beginning to fade. It is implied that an alternate version of Oy, the billy-bumbler, will also join them.|$|E
25|$|Several sculptures {{decorate}} the façade. One finds first of all, on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> two capitals, one {{coming from the}} Château de Bury, made in the Renaissance and brought to Troussay by Louis de la Saussaye; the other was realized in the 19th century by the sculptor Lafargue. On {{the top of the}} door, a small stone Virgin, replica of a wooden Virgin from the 15th century preserved at the Château de Cheverny. A small profile of a woman from the Italian Renaissance was encrusted on the left wing {{at the time of the}} restoration.|$|E

25|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} stands {{a statue of}} Our Mother of Good Counsel in a niche topped by a pediment and flanked by two pilasters – each pilaster on a pedestal {{on either side of}} it. The north transept is where the Baptistery is located. The statue of Our Mother of Good Counsel and the stained-glass window over the door hints to its previous designation as the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On the walls are memorial plaques to early personalities of the church, notably, John Connolly and Bishop Michel-Esther Le Turdu. The relics of Saint Laurent-Marie-Joseph Imbert can be found enshrined in the wall at the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hangars {{with open}} {{superstructures}} often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door)</b> by the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|E
25|$|The trumeau to {{each side}} and between the doors has {{thirteen}} life-size figures. The middle figure and the two figures on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> are raised by about half their height above the other figures. The figures on {{the left of the}} door represent the five Foolish Virgins while the ones on the right are the Wise Virgins. Below the outer two Wise Virgins and the two Foolish Virgins, two faces peer out of the wall on each side. On the wise side, they represent the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. On the foolish side, they represent Zephaniah and, maybe, Isaiah. In the center, between the two doors, is Justice flanked by two angels. Below Justice and the angels is a scroll commemorating the laying of the cornerstone in 1421.|$|E

25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall. Dr. Sheppard was with him but Parker told Mrs. Ackroyd that he left earlier and, as far as she knows, Sir Roger is now alone. Flora follows her mother to bed and Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a moment later to see Flora with her hand on the study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E
25|$|The Maitreya Temple {{known as}} (Jambu Chyenmu) {{on the west}} side is the tallest {{building}} of the monastery. It was erected in 1914 by the Ninth Panchen Lama to house a gigantic statue of the Maitreya Buddha and is 26.2 metres (86feet) in height. The statue sits on a splendid lotus throne in the 'European' posture with its hands in the symbolic teaching pose. A single finger of the giant figure is almost 4 feet in length. The statue contains 279kg (614lbs) of gold and 150,000kg (330,000lb) of copper and brass moulded on a solid wooden frame by Tibetan and Nepalese craftsmen. Small versions of the Maitreya are positioned in all four corners of the chamber and the murals on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> show a more active, antic style than any to be seen in Lhasa.|$|E
25|$|To {{left and}} right of the central door are two {{permanently}} installed fields consisting of upright flat marble slabs inlaid with an unusual Intarsia technique, with geometric and floral motifs cut into the marble in relief. The pictures are from the Arab tradition and are supplemented by small birds, swastikas, flowers, palmettes and leaves. The wells of the reliefs were originally filled with a red, now darkened mass of wax and mastic. In the same technique, marble inlays are also mounted on the pillar trim, connecting panels and the door lintels. Two icons are also embedded above the lintels. On the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the Panagia is depicted with the Child Jesus. To {{the right of the}} central door is the Christ Pantocrator with the right hand in a sign of blessing and the left holding a closed Evangelion. These two icons are modern creations which took the place of 17th century icons which were stolen in 1982.|$|E

25|$|The rear of {{the cabin}} faces {{northeast}} and contains a door and two sets of windows. Nearest the northwest corner are two windows of horizontal two-over-two sash construction, each measuring ten inches high by sixteen inches wide. Next to the windows are the door which leads into the kitchen, being 6 feet, 2 inches high by 2 feet, ten inches wide; like the front door it is also tongue and groove construction, although at a 45 degree angle. A wooden porch with three steps leads up to the door, and measures four feet, six inches wide. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> are a sequence of five windows looking into the art studio.

25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
