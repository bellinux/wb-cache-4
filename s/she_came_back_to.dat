Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind.

5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, {{as the mother}} of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to the}} Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, they settle down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E

After this, she retired for a few years, {{and came back with}} a show called España y su Cantaora (Spain and her singer), together with her husband, which she toured for a few months and was acclaimed by the critics. Then she definitely retired again. In 1961 she received an homage in Córdoba, in which several well-known flamenco artists took part, such as Antonio Mairena, Juan Talega, Manuel Morao, or Fernando Terremoto. In 1968, a monument was built in her honour in her quarter of Alameda de Hércules. In the last three years of her life, she was completely retired owing to senile dementia. She died in 1969, {{a month and a half}} after her husband. In that same year, singer Anotnio Mairena recorded his album Honores a la Niña de los Peines in homage to her.

Danieling Romualdez did not have children on his own but had adopted three orphans. According to the book The Untold Story of Imelda Marcos by Carmen Navarro-Pedrosa, her status in the house of Danieling Romualdez was [...] "higher than servants and lower than family members as a poor relative". During her father's visit to Manila, she worked as a salesgirl in a store called P. E.

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
