5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{variability}} in the conditions of deployment environments introduces new challenges for the resilience of our computer systems. As a response to said challenges, novel approaches must be devised so that identity robustness be guaranteed autonomously and with minimal overhead. This paper provides the elements of one such approach. First, building on top of previous results, we formulate a metric framework to compare specific aspects of the resilience of systems and environments. Such framework is then put to use by sketching {{the elements of a}} handshake mechanism between systems declaring their resilience figures and environments stating their minimal resilience requirements. Despite its simple formulation it is shown how said mechanism enables scenarios in which resilience can be autonomously enhanced, e. g., through forms of social collaboration. This paves the way to future “auto-resilient ” systems, namely systems able to reason and revise their own architectures and organisations <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> optimally <b>guarantee</b> identity persistence. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Dynamic image {{adaptation}} techniques {{have been shown}} to be effective to provide required tradeoffs between image quality, network bandwidth availability, and wireless transmission latency, enabling low-cost, best-effort wireless image data transmission. However, dynamic image adaptation is a CPU-intensive task, and thus may cause servers to experience significant computational loads, leading to unacceptably high server response times, and poor end-to-end service latency. This paper investigates the problem of providing guaranteed server-side latency while performing dynamic image adaptation. We introduce a serveraware image quality adaptation (SIQuA) technique, used to optimize the runtime image adaptation process <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>guaranteed</b> server-side latency with a maximized quality of image service level. SIQuA utilizes dynamic server conditions (server traffic loads and server resource availability), and optimizes both the quality of image serviced and the server-side latency required for runtime image adaptation simultaneously through judicious tuning of image compression parameters. We demonstrate that SIQuA can significantly reduce the server-side latency with a minimal impact on the image quality, thereby enabling efficient wireless image services with greatly reduced overall service costs.
