5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E

These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus.

The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> striatum and neocortex.|$|E
