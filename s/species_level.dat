40|$|Chemostat models {{provide the}} {{foundation}} for much current research in bioengineering, ecology, and population biology [8]. In engineering, the chemostat {{is known as the}} continuous-stirred tank reactor. It is used to model the dynamics of interacting organisms in waste-water treatment plants, lakes and oceans, and in biomedical contexts. The basic mathematical model of the chemostat is a system of nonlinear differential equations whose state variables are the <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> and the levels of the limiting nutrients. Well-mixed chemostats lead to ordinary differential equations. Our chemostat-related research provides mechanisms for guaranteeing robust asymptotically stable coexistence of two species in well-mixed chemostats with only one limiting nutrient. Much of this work uses Lyapunov-based nonlinear control theory or Poincaré-Bendixson theory to design the dilution rate to be a feedback controller [3, 6]. When the dilution rate is a positive constant and the uptake functions are strictly increasing, the competitive exclusion principle implies that generically, all trajectories converge to an equilibrium where only one species survives [8]. Therefore, to guarantee coexistence, we choose a nonconstant dilution rate feedback controller depending on the <b>species</b> <b>levels.</b> However, the actual <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> may be uncertain, because of photometric methods that only calculate the sum of the <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> rather than the individual <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> or because the measurements may take time, so only old measurements may be available. To allow for this uncertainty, we design output feedback controllers that depend only on the sum of the <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> and that also yield coexistence under unknown measurement delays in the feedbac...|$|R

Isolates were previously identified by use of phenotypic testing and/or 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Manufacturer-specified score cutoffs for genus- and species-level identification were used. After excluding 7 isolates not present in the Biotyper library, the Biotyper correctly identified 284 (95 %) and 207 (69 %) isolates to the genus and <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively, using extraction. By using direct colony testing, the Biotyper identified 168 (56 %) and 60 (20 %) isolates to the genus and <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. Overall, more isolates were identified to the genus and <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> with preparatory extraction than with direct colony testing (P < 0. 0001). The analysis was repeated after dividing the isolates into two subgroups, staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci (n 217) and “related genera ” (n 81). For the former subgroup, the extraction method resulted {{in the identification of}} 213 (98 %) and 171 (79 %) isolates to the genus and <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively, whereas the direct colony method identified 136 (63 %) and 56 (26 %) isolates to the genus and <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether patients with male factor infertility can be accurately identified by calculating a novel semen quality score and measuring levels of {{reactive oxygen species}} during routine infertility screening. METHODS: Semen samples from 133 patients and 91 healthy donors were evaluated with manual and computer-assisted semen analysis. A principal component analysis model was employed to calculate a semen quality score. In brief, this score was calculated by base 10 logarithms multiplied by varying weights given to 9 sperm parameters. Reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: The semen quality score had a sensitivity of 80. 45 % and accuracy of 77 % at a cutoff of 93. 1 in identifying patients with male factor infertility. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the semen quality score was 84. 28 % (95 % CI: 65. 22 %- 100 %). Reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> [log 10 (reactive oxygen species + 1) ] were significantly higher in male factor infertility patients. Reactive oxygen species had a sensitivity of 83. 47 % and specificity of 60. 52 % with an accuracy of 75 % at a cutoff of 1. 25 in identifying male factor infertility patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> was 78. 92 % (95 % CI: 72. 60 %- 85. 23 %). semen quality scores were significantly and negatively correlated with reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> in the donors and the male factor infertility patients. CONCLUSIONS: The semen quality score and reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> in semen samples appear to be strongly associated with male factor infertility.

The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E

5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved.

In the Dinosaur Park Formation, over fifty articulated specimens have been found, coming from many different genera. Among them, juveniles are hard to identify at the <b>species</b> <b>level.</b> Earlier, four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation's area, when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa. The smallest specimens were identified as Tetragonosaurus, now seen as a synonym of Procheneosaurus, and the largest skeletons were called either Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus; an adult was identified as Parasaurolophus. Small lambeosaurines from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were referred to Cheneosaurus.|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{disorders are}} {{often associated with}} increased oxidative stress and antioxidant therapy is frequently given as treatment. However, the role of oxidative stress in oxidative phosphorylation disorders or patients {{is far from clear}} and consequently the preventive or therapeutic effect of antioxidants is highly anecdotic. Therefore, we performed a systematic study of a panel of oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels,</b> damage and defense) in fibroblasts of twelve well-characterized oxidative phosphorylation patients with a defect in the POLG 1 gene, in the mitochondrial DNA-encoded tRNA-Leu gene (m. 3243 A>G or m. 3302 A>G) and in one of the mitochondrial DNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase complex I (CI) subunits. All except two cell lines (one POLG 1 and one tRNA-Leu) showed increased reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> compared with controls, but only four (two CI and two tRNA-Leu) cell lines provided evidence for increased oxidative protein damage. The absence of a correlation between reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>levels</b> and oxidative protein damage implies differences in damage prevention or correction. This was investigated by gene expression studies, which showed adaptive and compensating changes involving antioxidants and the unfolded protein response, especially in the POLG 1 group. This study indicated that patients display individual responses and that detailed analysis of fibroblasts enables the identification of patients that potentially benefit from antioxidant therapy.

5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the <b>species</b> <b>level</b> and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure.

International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the <b>species</b> <b>level,</b> and many consist of a mix of various species.

I. detectus castrae was originally described as {{a variant of the}} meat ant in 1925 (as I. d. var. castrae), but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985; subsequently, a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at <b>species</b> <b>level</b> while I. d. castrae was synonymised, based on morphological examinations of collected material. Camponotus horni, Formica smithii and Liometopum aeneum were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera, but these classifications were short-lived, as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical, and subsequently synonymised them with the meat ant. Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory. In 1930, Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with the meat ant. However, the queen was later found to be distinct from the workers and C. horni was redescribed as a species. The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain the validity of the name, making Clark the new author of C. horni. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark's C. horni, a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through. Clark's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby's C. horni.|$|E

We also analyzed hyperspectral data measured in the lab to compare with those from in situ collections. Using a set of 97 field measurements we compared spectra qualities for different seagrass <b>species,</b> <b>levels</b> of seagrass cover, water depths, and substrate types over wavelengths 400 – 800 nm, using spectral data preprocessing and data transformation. Optimal wavelengths for identifying seagrass <b>species</b> and <b>levels</b> of seagrass cover were determined by two-sample t-tests. We also utilized principal component analysis (PCA) on spectra to evaluate if a set of first five PCs {{could be used to}} discriminate effectively among seagrass <b>species</b> and <b>levels</b> of seagrass cover.
