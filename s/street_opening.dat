5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers <b>Street</b> <b>opening</b> in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the two parts of the hotel together.|$|E
25|$|Because of the inequities of the <b>street</b> <b>opening</b> and {{regulating}} system, {{in which}} property owners were assessed multiple times, {{and it could}} take years {{for just a few}} blocks to be completed, and because of increasing corruption once Tammany Hall came into power, the state legislature changed the system in 1869. In the new arrangement, the city could pay for 50% of the cost of building streets above 14th Street, and up to 100% below that line, through general tax revenues. This new system was very long-lived: it remained in effect until 1961, when a new city charter came into effect.|$|E
500|$|Prohibition agents {{closed the}} {{original}} club on December 22, 1931, and Billingsley moved it to East 51st Street for three years. It was raided in August 1932 at the 51st Street location after an angry patron lost a quarter in a coin machine and notified police. The police asked guests to quietly pay their checks {{and leave the}} building; this took two hours. [...] In 1934, the Stork Club moved to 3 East 53rd Street, where it remained until it closed in October 1965. Billingsley's guest list for the 53rd <b>Street</b> <b>opening</b> consisted of people from Broadway and Park Avenue. [...] He sent out 1,000 invitations for Champagne and dinner. The women found much to like about the fresh flowers everywhere and the mirrored walls, while the men were pleased to see their favorite dishes on the club's menu {{as well as many}} of their personal and business friends at the opening. When the Stork Club became a tenant in 1934, the building was known as the Physicians and Surgeons Building. Many of the medical tenants were unhappy about the night club moving in, but in February 1946, Billingsley purchased the seven-story building for $300,000 cash, evicting the doctors to expand the club.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 May 2010, the Coronation <b>Street</b> <b>opening</b> {{sequence}} {{was given}} a revamp. From that date all episodes of the series would be transmitted in High Definition. The change coincided with a week of dramatic storylines known as [...] "Siege Week" [...] being shown on five consecutive nights following Britain's Got Talent. In the story Tony Gordon escaped from prison to seek vengeance on his enemies and enlisting {{the help of a}} former cellmate Robbie to kidnap Carla Connor and Hayley Cropper in the Underworld Factory with the intent to murder them. Carla and Hayley are bound and gagged in the factory while Tony shoots Robbie. Carla pleads with Tony to release Hayley, which he eventually agrees to do on the condition that he and Carla will die together. The storyline culminated in the dramatic explosion of Underworld, which killed Tony while Carla untied herself and escaped unharmed. Meanwhile, Gail Platt's murder trial took place, with two different verdicts being shown online. However, following the Cumbria shootings, that occurred on 2 June 2010, the soap was temporarily taken off-air, as it was felt that this plot was too similar to real life events. The remaining siege episodes were transmitted the following week instead, in a heavily truncated schedule. On 17 September 2010, Coronation Street entered Guinness World Records as the world's longest-running television soap opera after the American soap opera As the World Turns concluded. William Roache was listed as the world's longest-running soap actor.|$|E

2500|$|Shippen Street {{was named}} after William W. Shippen, who owned large {{properties}} in Weehawken Heights [...] adjacent to those in West Hoboken belonging to the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, {{of which he was}} the president for 21 years. A prominent German immigrant population in the area during the late 19th century housed large groups of anarchists; saloons could be found in several locations within the Union Hill area. The largest assembly hall, The New Casino was on Shippen Street. Although it now ends at Palisades, in the past the name Shippen Street was used {{at least as far as}} Central Avenue, where it was once proposed by the city government and townspeople to utilize a 200-foot shaft used in the construction of the railroad tunnels as a stop to provide North Hudson's then 130,000 residents within the mile radius of the shaft with transportation to the Pennsylvania Station being constructed in Manhattan. In 1904, the Geological Society surveyed the area, but ultimately no stop was made on Shippen Street. A few years later in 1907, 125 men working in the North River Tunnels were forced to evacuate through the Shippen <b>Street</b> <b>opening</b> when tar paper used for waterproofing became ignited. Eleven men were unaccounted for upon the initial count; they were found 500 feet from the shaft at Shippen alive but unconscious, and had apparently survived by inhaling oxygen through a compressed air pipe which they hacked through. Although some were hospitalized with serious injury, none were reported dead.|$|E

There are no boxes--the whole theatre is scarcely larger than a stage-box--and you pay ten soldi to go into the pit, where you are much more comfortable than the aristocrats who have paid fifteen for places in the dress-circle above. The stage is very small, and the scenery a kind of coarse miniature painting. But it is very complete, and every thing is contrived to give relief to the puppets and to produce an illusion of magnitude in their figures. They are very artlessly introduced, and are maneuvered, according to the exigencies of the scene, by means of cords running from their heads, arms, and legs {{to the top of the}} stage. To the management of the cords they owe all the vehemence of their passions and the grace of their oratory, not to mention a certain gliding, ungradual locomotion, altogether spectral.|$|E

In the common coach he got a very good seat on the shady side, where he put down his hand-bag. Then he looked at his watch, and as it was still fifteen minutes before train-time, he indulged a fantastic impulse. He left the car and hurried back through the station and out through the electrics, hacks, herdics, carts, and string-teams of Causeway Street, and up the sidewalk of the <b>street</b> <b>opening</b> into it, as far as the S. B. & H. C. freight-depot. On the way he bet himself five dollars that Miss Desmond's piano would not be there, and lost; for at the moment he came up it was unloading from the end of the truck which he had seen carrying it past the window of his restaurant.|$|E

40|$|We {{regarded}} high-rise compact {{urban areas}} as obstacles and pathways to the approaching wind. Flow rates across <b>street</b> <b>openings,</b> open <b>street</b> roofs and along street networks contribute to air exchange between urban airspaces and their external surroundings. We numerically studied the ventilation and air change rates in some aligned square building arrays (the building width B = 30 mm, building heights H = 2 B or 2. 67 B) with building area densities of λp = 0. 25 or 0. 4 (i. e. the ratio between the plan area of buildings viewed {{from above and}} the total underlying surface area). The main and secondary streets are parallel and perpendicular to the approaching wind respectively. Urban parameters are found important to the ventilation. The taller buildings (H = 2. 67 B) may capture larger inflow rates across windward <b>street</b> <b>openings</b> than the lower (H = 2 B). Wider streets and smaller building area density provide more wind pathways and obtain larger flow rates along street networks. Meanwhile, the flow rates along the street may quickly decrease due to strong resistances produced by high-rise buildings, so the total street length should be limited, otherwise the ventilation in downstream regions is not good. The secondary streets always experience worse ventilation than the main streets. A building height variation benefits ventilation in the secondary streets by enhancing vertical mean flow rates across street roofs in contrast to those with uniform heights. If the base of all buildings is open from z = 0 to 0. 33 B, the ventilation in both the main and secondary streets becomes better. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
