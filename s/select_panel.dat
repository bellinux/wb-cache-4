We can observe a number of deficiencies in panel housing estates (for example: lack of parking space, unsatisfactory capacity in education etc.). Postponing regeneration may cause not only higher financial demands, but also social, technical, and environmental problems, and it is therefore necessary to solve these deficiencies as soon as possible. Based on a comparison with already regenerated areas and standards for technical and civic amenities, standards of housing for <b>selected</b> <b>panel</b> housing estates will be defined. It {{will be followed by}} a comparative analysis of a current state of panel housing estates with housing standards. This comparison results in a definition of requirements and quantification of costs required for regeneration of a given territory...|$|R
