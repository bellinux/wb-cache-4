How feeble seemed his own adventure and advancement; how even ludicrous his pretensions to any patronage and superiority. How this common backwoodsman had set him in his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and Heckshill!

2500|$|Titor's story {{could also}} have been {{inspired}} by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank's classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of [...] "Fort Repose", while Titor claimed to live in the [...] "Fort", formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the <b>sending</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.|$|R

The results were published as an appendix to the second edition of Kelly's Universal Cambist (1831), and later as a separate book entitled Oriental Metrology (1832).|$|R
