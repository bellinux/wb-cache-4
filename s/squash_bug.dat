50|$|There {{seems to}} be {{different}} biotypes across the United States, preying on different hosts in different regions. In northern California, a population of the fly parasitised the bordered plant bug, Largus succinctus, but did not attack the <b>squash</b> <b>bug,</b> Anasa tristis. In an experiment, T. pennipes was collected from squash fields in New York State and released near squash fields in California. The insects targeted the squash bugs and established permanent populations. Their eggs are now found deposited on nearly 50% of the squash bugs in the area but {{it is unclear how}} effective this is in controlling the crop pests. On the southern green stink bug, the rate of parasitism can be as high as 93% and up to 80% on the <b>squash</b> <b>bug.</b> However, T. pennipes does not prevent all crop damage as the bugs continue to feed and reproduce after being parasitised, though the reproductive organs begin to atrophy when the parasitoid reaches the second instar stage. Control of the pest is more effective when nymphs are parasitised since half of these die before becoming adults and any that overwinter will die before laying eggs.|$|E

Preimaginal development of the <b>squash</b> <b>bug</b> (egg to adult) was similar on all three cultivars (range: 31 - 35 d). However, survivorship to the adult was significantly lower on `Green Striped Cushaw' and `Waltham Butternut' than on `Early Prolific Straightneck'. Statistical differences in survivorship were not observed in second-generation squash bugs, suggesting that some selection may have occurred. <b>Squash</b> <b>bug</b> reproduction and longevity were similar on all three cultivars. However, the reduced juvenile survivorship on `Green Striped Cushaw' and `Waltham Butternut' resulted in significantly lower r[subscript max] values on these cultivars than on the more susceptible `Early Prolific Straightneck'. The dietary history of adult squash bugs did not significantly affect development, preimaginal survival, or reproduction of G. pennsylvanicum. However, adult longevity of the parasitoid was significantly reduced when its larvae developed in eggs of squash bugs that were reared on the most resistant cultivar (`Waltham Butternut') ...|$|E

40|$|DESCRIPTION AND BIOLOGY: Squash bugs {{are one of}} {{the primary}} pests of {{cucurbits}} in the United States. Adults are typically 10 to 30 mm long, dark gray, brown or black in color with orange or brown markings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen (Fig. 1). Overwintering adults emerge from the soil, ground litter, wood piles or buildings in the spring. After feeding and mating, females deposit egg masses on the underside of leaves. Newly laid eggs are typically light pale in color, become coppery, then darker as they develop. Egg masses are commonly laid in diamond or V-shaped patterns along leaf veins (Fig 2). Nymphs are 2. 5 to 10 mm long, light green upon hatching and light to dark gray with each successive molt (Fig. 3). Nymphs have black legs and antennae. There are five nymphal instars with an average development time of 33 days. The last two instars have a more distinct thorax and wing pads. Nymphs aggregate and feed close to their parent egg mass, on the underside of leaves, until later stages of wilt set in on the leaf (Fig. 3). <b>Squash</b> <b>bug</b> nymphs and adults are cryptic, frequently hiding in the shaded parts of plants, under plastic mulches, in thick weed beds, or in wilted fruit and foliage. Squash bugs can complete their egg to adult life cycle in four to six weeks. Fig. 1. Adult female <b>squash</b> <b>bug</b> laying eggs on the underside of a pumpkin leaf.

40|$|Field {{releases}} {{of the indigenous}} egg parasitoid Grayon pennsylvanicum (Ashmead) resulted in a 4 -fold reduction in <b>squash</b> <b>bug,</b> Anasa tristis (De Geer), densities on 'Jack-O-Lantern' pumpkins in 1991. However, pest populations subjected to parasitoids were consistently higher, and fruit yields and quality lower, than on plants that were treated with the insecticide, esfenvalerate, When the squash bug-resistant 'Green-Striped Cushaw' was used, the difference in pest densities on parasitoid-released and insecticide-treated plants was only half of that observed on the susceptible cultivar. In 1992, under abnormally wet, cool conditions, <b>squash</b> <b>bug</b> densities were higher on insecticide-treated plants and lower on plants where parasitoids were released than in 1991. Fruit quality for both cultivars was substantially reduced in all treatments in 1992, The wet, cool conditions apparently had less of an effect on pest densities and fruit yields on resistant pumpkins than on susceptible pumpkins. The expected net income for insecticide-treated pumpkins was substantially lower in 1992 than in 1991. Where biological control and host plant resistance were combined, loss in expected net income in 1992 was considerably less than in 1991. Although costs associated with biological control were very high relative to the revenues, integrating biological control with host plant resistance may have some potential as an alternative management strategy...|$|E

40|$|The <b>squash</b> <b>bug,</b> Anasa tristis DeGeer, {{undergoes}} a reproductive diapause from late summer to spring in northeastern Kansas. In the laboratory, diapause was induced in 100 % of adult females reared under photoperiods shorter than 14 : 10 (L:D) {{and in a}} variably lower {{percentage of the population}} under all longer photoperiods. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction falls between 14 : 10 and 14. 5 : 9. 5; this range compares closely with prevailing natural daylengths when 50 % of the adult population enters diapause in the field. Between October and March, short daylengths maintained, and long daylengths terminated, diapause in field-sampled adults. Under natural daylength at 26 °C, the duration of diapause became progressively shorter with advancing sample date. In nature, the photoperiodic maintenance of diapause is completed in most of the population by late May. A prolonged diapause probably serves to prevent premature postdiapause development during the thermally variable spring conditions encountered in Kansas. Some implications of these findings for biological control and pest management programs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the gregarious <b>squash</b> <b>bug</b> egg parasitoids Ooencyrtus anasae and O. n. sp. near anasae (O. sp.) were conducted at 20. 8, 23. 0, and 26. 6 °C.

Temperature had no significant influence on survivorship, progeny production, or sex ratio. At each temperature, O. anasae developed and emerged about a day earlier and produced a significantly higher percentage of female progeny (77 %) than did O. sp. (60 %). Both parasitoids deposited an average of three (2 - 7) progeny per host. However, O. anasae consistently deposited more female eggs per host than did O. sp. Proportion of females produced per host by O. anasae tended to increase directly with number of hosts parasitized, but no such relationship was observed in O. sp. Total preimaginal survivorship in both parasitoids was about 89 %. In O. sp., male progeny that developed without females emerged about a day later at all temperatures and had a lower pharate adult survivorship than did males that developed in hosts with female siblings...|$|E

5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, <b>squash</b> <b>bugs,</b> and ants.

However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|R
