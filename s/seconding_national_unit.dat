5000|$|A {{product of}} {{territorial}} apartheid, Bophuthatswana - popularly nicknamed [...] "Bop" [...] by her nationals - accepted nominal independence in 1977 from South Africa's Nationalist administration. The <b>second</b> <b>national</b> <b>unit</b> {{to reach the}} status of a bantustan with limited but hypothetically increasing powers of self-rule, Bophuthatswana adopted as her governing document an act drafted by the former Tswana Territorial Authority under South African guidance. South Africa was adamant that elections should take place as early as 1972, but there were no political parties in the new region. This changed rapidly with the ascension of Kgosi Lucas Mangope, who founded the Lekobo la Setshaba sa Bophuthatswana (English: [...] "Bophuthatswana National Party"). Mangope targeted rural votes and carried an easy majority in the new parliament.|$|R
