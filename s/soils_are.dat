5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of soils by levels of permeability and runoff potential in the Buffalo Creek watershed. These are rated from A to D, with A-type soils having {{the highest level of}} permeability and lowest runoff potential and D having the lowest level of permeability and highest runoff potential. C-type <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> the most common, and occur in the eastern and central parts of the watershed. B-type soils primarily occur {{in the western part of}} the watershed. D-type <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> scattered throughout the watershed and A-type soils occur in areas of the southern and southeastern parts of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Topsoils {{are thin}} and poor because the glaciers had abraded {{down to the}} bedrock. The <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> clayey silt.|$|E
5|$|Favoured <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation {{is typically}} scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the organic}} {{component}} of a <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> substantial, the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> called organic <b>soil</b> rather than mineral <b>soil.</b> A <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> called organic if: ...|$|R
50|$|C. Matasi: This type of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> {{found at}} {{elevation}} higher than Kanhar {{and less than}} Bhata. This <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> appropriate for rice crop. This type of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> found in {{the most of the}} area of Kanker region.|$|R
50|$|The {{other type}} of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> organic <b>soil.</b> This type of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> found {{in areas that are}} warmer and have more moisture. Some {{vegetation}} that lives here are algae, fungi and mosses. One type of organic <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> the brown <b>soils,</b> which have drainage.|$|R
5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, {{although it}} has been found on nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows {{in areas where the}} <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E
5|$|The main soils in the {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil. The watershed's <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> in mostly the hydrologic soil groups B and C. However, the hydrological soil group D is also present.|$|E
30|$|The {{principal}} {{clay mineral}} present in this <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> “montmorollinite”. This <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> obtained from Belgaum district, Karnataka, India.|$|R
30|$|To {{apply the}} EPB model shield machine in sandy stratum, <b>soil</b> {{conditioning}} <b>is</b> required [18]. Furthermore, excavated <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> easier to remove {{after it has}} been conditioned [19]. In our experiment, the test <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> simple to prepare and easy to excavate. By injecting pure water with surfactant to the test bin, the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> more easily excavated and removed.|$|R
50|$|A. Kanhar: This type of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> {{black in}} color and oilish. The {{capacity}} of water absorption in this <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> greater {{and this is very}} useful in growth of Kharif and Rabi crops in the region. This type of <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> found in the plane of Kotri and Mahanadi regions.|$|R
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> {{hard in the}} dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors {{are well}} adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant food are essential components of the gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of alfalfa, wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E
30|$|The {{cultivation}} <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished from}} marsh deposits by its different particle composition, color, and texture. This <b>soil</b> type <b>is</b> interbedded between the E 3 and E 1 deposits (Fig.  6). Event deposits, marsh deposits, and cultivation <b>soil</b> <b>are</b> also easily distinguishable by their density and color (Fig.  7). The {{dry bulk density}} of cultivation <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> intermediate between low-density marsh deposits and high-density event deposits.|$|R
30|$|The {{principal}} {{clay mineral}} present in this <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> “kaolinite”. This natural <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> obtained from BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore district, Karnataka, India.|$|R
50|$|Hydric <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> <b>soil</b> which <b>is</b> {{permanently}} or seasonally saturated by water, {{resulting in}} anaerobic conditions, {{as found in}} wetlands.|$|R
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{consists of}} the Permo-Triassic New Red Sandstone in the south, and the Middle Coal Measures of the Manchester Coalfield to the north. The upper <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> a mixture of clay and sand, with a subsoil of clay. The Astley area encompasses smaller, suburban and semi-outlying areas, including Blackmoor, Astley Green, Gin Pit and Cross Hillock. The isolated hamlet of terraced houses at Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company. Peace Street, Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia occurs {{along the}} eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong, New South Wales {{in the south to}} Rockhampton, Queensland in the north. There are {{isolated}} populations offshore on Fraser Island, and inland at Blackdown Tableland National Park and Crows Nest in Queensland, and also inland incursions {{at the base of the}} Glasshouse Mountains in southern Queensland, at Grafton in northern New South Wales, and Bilpin and Lawson in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.B.oblongifolia grows in a range of habitats—in damp areas with poor drainage, along the edges of swamps and flats, as well as wallum shrubland, or coastal plateaux. It is also found in open forest or woodland, where it grows on ridges or slopes, or heath. <b>Soils</b> <b>are</b> predominantly sandy or sandstone-based, though granite-based and clay-loams are sometimes present.|$|E
40|$|This paper deals {{about the}} {{stabilization}} of expansive soil on experimental basis. The stabilization of expansive <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> required because their volume can be change {{due to the}} variation in moisture content on it, which leads to either shrink or swell while the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> in dry or wet condition respectively. The stabilization of expansive <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> assessed {{by the presence of}} different percentage of steel slag and fly ash on the expensive soil and the performance of modified expansive <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> evaluated using index properties test, permeability test, compaction test and unconfined compressive strength test. Based on this performance tests, optimum amount of steel slag and fly ash on expensive <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> also determined...|$|R
30|$|AMF {{community}} {{composition in}} EXO and NAT <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> dissimilar. Available phosphorus, diversity index, spore abundance, and species richness {{were the main}} factors differing between the EXO and NAT soils. In general, the most dominant order present in the <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> Glomerales (44.8 %) and Gigasporales (41.4 %). The most abundant AMF genus in all studied <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> Funneliformis.|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{although}} {{the areas of}} soil and water loss control are increasing every year, the effective thickness of black <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> still decreasing. The food productivity of the parent material of the black <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> very low. The current average thickness of black <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> about 25 cm in Baiquan County. When the thickness of black <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> lower than 20 cm, the soil productivity would decrease sharply and lower the food production [16]. This would be potential risk to the food security and should be further investigated in the future.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. <b>Soils</b> <b>are</b> typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5000|$|Bulk <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> <b>soil</b> {{outside the}} rhizosphere. Bulk <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> not {{penetrated}} by plant roots. Natural organic compounds are much lower in bulk soil {{than in the}} rhizosphere. [...] Microbial populations are typically lower in bulk soil than in rhizospheric soil. Furthermore, bulk <b>soil</b> inhabitants <b>are</b> generally smaller than identical species in the rhizosphere.|$|R
30|$|The {{collected}} bulk <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> air-dried spreading on a {{sheet of}} paper. The air-dried sample was then broken by crushing it gently using a wooden hammer, mixed thoroughly and were passed through 2 -mm sieve. The processed <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> used for plant growth. A tiny portion of the <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> broken again and passed through a 0.5 -mm sieve for further laboratory analysis.|$|R
30|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>was</b> {{randomly}} {{collected from}} the Teaching and Research Farm, Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola from the depth zone of 0 – 20  cm using a spade. <b>Soil</b> samples <b>were</b> bulked into composite sample. Then 5  kg of <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> weighed into uniform plastic pots.|$|R
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E
5|$|The main {{settlement}} {{on the island}} today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land {{to the east of}} the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length. Much {{of the rest of the}} area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to 'turf scalping' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E
50|$|This <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> {{deficient}} in phosphoric acid, nitrogen and humus, but potash and lime are usually present in sufficient quantity. The most common <b>soil</b> in Bihar <b>is</b> Gangetic alluvium of Indo-Gangetic plain region, Piedmont Swamp <b>Soil</b> which <b>is</b> found in northwestern part of West Champaran district and Terai <b>Soil</b> which <b>is</b> found in {{northern part of}} Bihar along the border of Nepal. clay soil, sand soil and loamy <b>soil</b> <b>are</b> common in Bihar.|$|R
50|$|Natural Resources: Land and soil:The most of {{the land}} {{occupied}} by agriculture purpose as well as one river is flowing through this sansad.
