5|$|Aguilera {{announced}} via Twitter on September 12, 2012 {{that the}} album would be titled Lotus. The album artwork {{was shot by}} fashion photographer Enrique Badulescu. Aguilera unveiled the cover on October 5, where she is shown nude with her long, blonde hair covering her nipples, while her vulva is <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> a white light; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower. It received a generally positive response from critics; Tiffany Lee from Yahoo! Music complimented Aguilera's figure, while Sam Lansky from Idolator drew comparisons to the cover of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E

50|$|Colours {{are reduced}} in <b>shade</b> <b>by</b> simply adding more stock (printing) paste. For example, {{a dark blue}} {{containing}} 4 oz. of methylene blue per gallon may readily {{be made into a}} pale <b>shade</b> <b>by</b> adding to it thirty times its bulk of starch paste or gum, as the case may be. The procedure is similar for other colours.|$|R
25|$|A heavily ornamented three-bay facade is <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> two gazebo-like front terraces. Each bay {{consists}} {{of a series of}} four Corinthian columns upon pedestals, arranged around a 3/4-circle plan. Decorative wrought-iron railings in curvilinear Art Nouveau designs span between each of the pedestals.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} garrisoned {{by a few}} {{thousand}} irregulars (kasidars), the regular troops of Afghan Turkestan being cantoned at Takhtapul, near Mazari Sharif. The gardens to the north-east contained a caravanserai that formed {{one side of a}} courtyard, which was <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> a group of chenar trees Platanus orientalis.|$|E
25|$|Addressing Gregory Terrace is Gregory Rest, a {{grassed area}} <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> three large Weeping Fig trees {{which have been}} trimmed to a formal shape. This area also {{contains}} the School Band Stand, a modern steel structure with twin semi-circular roofs. The fig trees and the continued use of this site for school band performances are significant.|$|E

25|$|This was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} a triangular series between Bermuda, Canada and Kenya. However, after Kenya rescheduled their ODIs with Bangladesh due to their lack of financial backing, they also cancelled their matches against Bermuda. The ODI series followed the Intercontinental Cup tie between the two nations, which Canada <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> 25 runs; however, in the short form, Kenya won after bowling Canada out for 129 in the first match and 94 in the second.|$|E
25|$|If a {{tree species}} in a dense forest grows taller than {{surrounding}} tree species, it {{is able to}} absorb more of the incoming sunlight. However, less sunlight is then available for the trees that are <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> the taller tree, thus interspecific competition. Leopards and lions can also be in interspecific competition, since both species feed on the same prey, and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food.|$|E
25|$|Sunlight: Trees {{generally}} {{require a}} good deal of sun, and most bonsai need direct sunlight during the growing season to thrive. Some shade-tolerant species of bonsai cannot thrive with too much direct sunlight, however, and it is the grower's role to site the bonsai specimens to provide the correct lighting for each type. Most bonsai will be located in an area that gets several hours of direct daylight. Shade-tolerant bonsai can be placed behind barriers (walls, buildings), sited on shaded benches or stands, or <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> netting to reduce the impact of direct sunlight.|$|E

25|$|There are two picnic {{areas at}} Little Buffalo State Park. Both areas have {{a view of}} Lake Holman and are largely <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> oak, maple and ash trees. The Main Picnic Area {{is close to the}} {{swimming}} pool. It shares a first-aid station, shower area, and food concession with the pool. The picnic area is also the location of a playground, horseshoe pits, two pavilions, restrooms, picnic tables and grills and a boat rental station. The East Picnic Area is near the historical covered bridge and farmhouse. It has restrooms, picnic tables and grills, a horseshoe pit, a pavilion, an environmental interpretive center and the Moore Performing Arts Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{architecture}} {{had to be}} adapted to suit the extremes of the Mediterranean and desert climate. White and light colors reflected the heat. Walls not only provided privacy but protected against the sun. Large areas of glass that let in the light, {{a key element of}} the Bauhaus style in Europe, were replaced with small recessed windows that limited the heat and glare. Long narrow balconies, each <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> the balcony above it, allowed residents to catch the breeze blowing in from the sea to the west. Slanted roofs were replaced with flat ones, providing a common area where residents could socialize in the cool of the evening.|$|E
25|$|On {{another side}} of the main square, there is the San Agustin Church. The village church was {{established}} here in 1547 by the Dominicans, but the current structure on the site dates from the 18th century. It has an austere façade and faces the main square. Around it is an atrium, some simple gardens and a patios <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> fruit trees. A fire {{at the end of}} the 19th century destroyed the Baroque altar, replaced with the sober one seen today. This parish is the site of the annual San Agustin de las Cuevas Festival, which is the largest religious event in the borough.|$|E

25|$|In Florida Tucker Abbott (1952) {{recorded}} a density of Tarebia granifera 4444 m−2 which {{falls within the}} range of densities measured with a Van Veen grab in a number of sites in northern KwaZulu-Natal, where was measured desnsities 843.6 ±320.2 m−2 to 20764.4 ±13828.1 m−2. The site with such high density was non-flowing, devoid of rooted vegetation but it was <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> trees (Barringtonia racemosa) and by floating Eichhornia crassipes. This between-site variability may be positively correlated to habitat heterogeneity and food availability. Despite the very high densities recorded in the Nseleni River, indigenous invertebrates were still present in the sediments including: bivalve Chambardia wahlbergi, chironomids, oligochaetes (tubificids) and burrowing polychaetes were also found but in very low numbers.|$|E
25|$|The rear is also {{accessed}} {{through a}} door at ground level which leads into a large room with concrete floor and brick walls. This leads into a large modern bar opening onto an outdoor area through several large steel roller doors. This area has an auxiliary bar and servery and looks onto Stockman's Rest. It is floored with brick pavers and <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> a roof of corrugated steel supported on steel trusses. This is lined with a modern timber-look sheeting. The perimeter of this area has sections of heavy post and rails, {{some of which are}} decorated with cattle brands. A gateway also formed of heavy posts frame steps leading from the corner of the area down to the street.|$|E
25|$|His {{conflicts}} with actors and managers resulted in his sacking from Iași National Theater, {{and then his}} banishment from the National Theater Bucharest, leaving him to seek work with private companies. In the early 1910s, he also collected his prose poems, also producing memoirs and essays that outlined his ideas on society, and Christian drama. His contribution to screenwriting, albeit pioneering, was <b>shaded</b> <b>by</b> revelations of plagiarism from Caragiale. By then {{a veteran of the}} Second Balkan War, he fought on the Romanian front of World War I, and died soon after this ended, following a losing battle with paralysis. He had been largely forgotten as a writer, and was being derided by modernists, even though his plays continued to be performed into the 1930s.|$|E
