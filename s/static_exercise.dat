50|$|The {{level of}} {{physical}} activity in a person determines what physiological changes the heart makes. The two types of exercise are static (strength-training) and dynamic (endurance-training). <b>Static</b> <b>exercise</b> consists of weight lifting and is mostly anaerobic, meaning the body does not rely on oxygen for performance. It also moderately increases heart rate and stroke volume (oxygen debt). Dynamic exercises include running, swimming, skiing, rowing, and cycling, which rely on oxygen from the body. This type of exercise also increases both heart rate and stroke volume of the heart. Both static and dynamic exercises involve the thickening of the left ventricular wall due to increased cardiac output, which leads to physiologic hypertrophy of the heart. Once athletes stop training, the heart returns to its normal size.|$|E

We analyzed the effects on left and right ventricular function, ascending aorta dynamics, and venous capacitance using standard cine and phase-contrast sequences. Results: We observed excellent reproducibility in the measurements of the images obtained at rest as well as during <b>static</b> <b>exercise.</b> During exercise, we observed reduced left (− 35 ± 8 %, p &lt; 0. 001) and right (− 44 ± 9 %, p &lt; 0. 001) ventricle end-diastolic volumes, reduced left (− 35 ± 16 %, p &lt; 0. 001) and right (− 43 ± 8 %, p &lt; 0. 001) ventricle end-systolic volumes (both with a significantly greater reduction in the right ventricle), a reduced superior vena cava cross-sectional area (− 20 ± 17 %, p = 0. 003), and increased left ventricle wall thickness.

40|$|Lifting of a {{heavy weight}} may lead to "blackout" and {{occasionally}} also to cerebral hemorrhage, indicating pronounced consequences for the blood flow through the brain. We hypothesized that especially strenuous respiratory straining (a Valsalva-like maneuver) associated with intense <b>static</b> <b>exercise</b> {{would lead to a}} precipitous rise in mean arterial and central venous pressures and, in turn, influence the middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V-an) as a noninvasive indicator of changes in cerebral blood flow. In 10 healthy subjects, MCA V-an was evaluated in response to maximal static two-legged exercise performed either with a concomitantly performed Valsalva maneuver or with continued ventilation and also during a Valsalva maneuver without associated exercise (n = 6). During static two-legged exercise, the largest rise for mean arterial pressure and MCA V-an was established at the onset of exercise performed with a Valsalva-like maneuver (by 42 +/- 5 mmHg and 31 +/- 3 % vs. 22 +/- 6 mmHg and 25 +/- 6 % with continued ventilation; P < 0. 05). Profound reductions in MCA V-an were observed both after exercise with continued ventilation (- 29 +/- 4 % together with a reduction in the arterial CO 2 tension by - 5 +/- 1 Torr) and during the maintained Valsalva maneuver (- 21 +/- 3 % together with an elevation in central venous pressure to 40 +/- 7 mmHg). Responses to performance of the Valsalva maneuver with and without exercise were similar, reflecting the deterministic importance of the Valsalva maneuver for the central and cerebral hemodynamic response to intense <b>static</b> <b>exercise.</b> Continued ventilation during intense <b>static</b> <b>exercise</b> may limit the initial rise in arterial pressure and may in turn reduce the risk of hemorrhage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>exercises</b> on eNOS concentrations in the blood plasma of athletes who do cyclic and strength kind of sports, as well as in men, who are not involved in any sports. Materials and methods. Determination of plasma concentrations of eNOS was performed by using enzyme immunoassay. Blood samples were collected from weightlifters and track and field athletes before and after <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>exercises.</b> Results. It has been shown that regular exercises contribute to {{a significant increase in the}} background level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the plasma of athletes. It is necessary to note that eNOS is almost twice higher in the weightlifters than in the track and field athletes. eNOS concentrations significantly decrease in athletes after <b>static</b> <b>exercises,</b> but on the contrary, increase after dynamic exercises. eNOS level rise in untrained individuals occurs after all kinds of exercises, although the influence of dynamic exercises is much more pronounced. Plasma concentrations of eNOS in all groups returned to baseline during the recovery period.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the blood pressure and heart rate responses of adults with cerebral palsy to static muscular contractions and to dynamic muscular contractions. Fifteen adults with cerebral palsy and 15 able-bodied adults (average age for each group = 30 years) performed a <b>static</b> <b>exercise</b> protocol and a dynamic resistance exercise protocol using each limb (or the limbs capable of meeting the requirements of the exercise protocol). Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed before, during, and after each exercise bout with each limb. During the <b>static</b> <b>exercise</b> protocol, each subject performed static contractions at 40 % of maximal voluntary contraction to fatigue. The dynamic exercise protocol for each limb consisted of three 20 -second bouts of hydraulic resistance exercise each of which was followed by 20 seconds of rest. No differences were found between the two groups of subjects in heart rate and blood pressure during <b>static</b> <b>exercise.</b> In dynamic exercise, however, the trend in heart rate from bout to bout differed between the groups. In addition, the cerebral palsied group's diastolic pressure was higher than that of the able-bodied group at the end of dynamic exercise.

40|$|<b>Static</b> <b>exercise</b> {{in normal}} humans causes reflex {{increases}} in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) that are closely coupled to the contraction-induced decrease in muscle cell pH, {{an index of}} glycogen degradation and glycolytic flux. To deter-mine if sympathetic activation is attenuated when muscle gly-cogenolysis is blocked due to myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease), an inborn enzymatic defect localized to skeletal muscle, we now have performed microelectrode re-cordings of MSNA in four patients with McArdle's disease during static handgrip contraction. A level of static handgrip that more than doubled MSNA in normal humans had no ef-fect on MSNA and caused an attenuated rise in blood pressure in the patients with myophosphorylase deficiency. In contrast, two nonexercise sympathetic stimuli, Valsalva's maneuver and cold pressor stimulation, evoked comparably large increases in MSNA in patients and normals.
