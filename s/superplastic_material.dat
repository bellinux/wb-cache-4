The material characteristics were evaluated under three different superplastic temperatures, 643, 673, and 703 K {{in order to determine}} the most suitable superplastic temperature. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of rectangular pan forming was carried out to predict the formability of the material into a complex shape.

The experimental results revealed that the m values are greater than 0. 3 under the three superplastic temperatures, which is indicative of superplasticity. The optimum superplastic temperature is 673 K, at which a maximum m value and no grain growth were observed. The results of the FEM simulation revealed that certain localized thinning occurred at the die entrance of the deformed rectangular pan due to the insufficient ductility of the material.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the {{cavitation}} and grain growth during superplastic forming. Design/methodology/approach: Superplastic alloys exhibit the extremely large elongation to failure by their high strain rate sensitivity. Cavities have widely been observed during superplastic deformation of metals and alloys and lead to the degradation of material properties such as tensile, creep, fatigue and stress-corrosion behavior. In this work, a finite element method is developed, which considers the grain growth {{and the effect of}} material damage. Findings: The effects of material parameters and deformation damage on the superplastic deformation process are numerically analyzed, and the means to control cavitation growth is discussed. The microstructural mechanism of grain growth during superplastic deformation is also studied. A new model considering the grain growth is proposed and applied to conventional <b>superplastic</b> <b>materials</b> The relationships between the strain, the strain rate, the test temperature, the initial grain size and the grain growth respectively in <b>superplastic</b> <b>materials</b> are discussed.

40|$|Certain {{polycrystalline}} {{materials of}} fine equiaxed grains of size < 10 mum exhibit tensile ductility {{of several hundred}} to a few thousand per cent, called superplasticity, at intermediate strain rates and high temperatures. Experimental and theoretical results on mechanisms for superplastic deformation and concurrent microstructural evolution are reviewed to understand the role of grain boundary phenomena towards enhancement of grain growth and cavitation, etc. Grain boundary sliding (GBS) dominates superplastic flow, the extent of which varies between the grain and interphase boundaries in two-phase alloys. Accommodation to GBS is provided by diffusional and dislocation mechanisms, which are manifested {{in the form of}} grain boundary migration (GBM), grain rotation and grain switching events. Although GBS helps in retaining the initial equiaxed grain shape of <b>superplastic</b> <b>materials,</b> the accommodation processes accelerate grain growth. In the lack of other accommodation processes the cavities are formed, being more pronounced at the boundaries of maximum sliding. The ppm-level impurities present in <b>superplastic</b> <b>materials</b> do not influence the sliding and flow characteristics under typical superplastic conditions but they do promote cavitation and limit the ductility. The presence of precipitate or hard particles in quasi-single-phase <b>superplastic</b> <b>materials</b> inhibits GBM but provides sites for cavitation. Such materials exhibit more dislocation activities than anticipated for accommodation of GBS. The nature of microstructural changes noted during superplastic deformation supports the operation of cooperative GBS, in addition to a large variety of combinations between sliding and accommodation processes.

This is clearly mirrored by the mounting research {{activities in the}} field, and the ever-growing number of components formed by the superplastic forming (SPF) technique. In spite of that, currently available standards on characterising the behaviour of this unique class of materials are very limited, and do not agree {{on many of the}} issues they cover. On the other hand, the standards fail to cover some of the important and controversial issues in superplastic materials' testing, and therefore leave the reader without any guidelines on those particular issues.

The cell wall consisted of fine equiaxial crystal grains after solution treatment. High temperature deformation behavior of Zn- 22 Al alloy foams was evaluated through tensile and compressive tests at high temperature. Zn- 22 Al alloy foams exhibited high strain rate sensitivity of 0. 55, which was caused by superplastic deformation of the cell wall material. High temperature deformation mechanism can be explained using the new parameter of local strain rate. The Zn- 22 Al foams showed relatively high ductility at high temperature compered to aluminum foams. This is because of the superplastic deformation induced by the fine microstructure in the cell wall.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown the {{possibility}} of achieving superplastic behavior in laminated metal composites consisting of alternating layers of superplastic and non-superplastic materials. Achieving high rate sensitivity in such a laminate requires the appropriate choice of component materials and component volume fraction as well as deformation under appropriate conditions of strain rate and temperature. The first investigators to study this behavior were Snyder et al. [1], who demonstrated that a non-superplastic material (interstitial free iron) could be made superplastic by lamination with a <b>superplastic</b> <b>material</b> (fine-grained ultrahigh carbon steel (UHCS)). Other laminates in which superplasticity has been observed in a non-superplastic material include UHCS/stainless steel and UHCS/aluminum bronze. In these studies, tensile tests were conducted with the tensile axis parallel to the layers. High strain rate sensitivities were observed and are associated with high tensile ductilities. However, as observed by Tsai et al. [2], obtaining high strain rate sensitivity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for high elongations. Tsai et al. studied the UHCS/brass laminate and found that, despite a strain rate sensitivity exponent of 0. 5, only about 60 % elongation was obtained. The low tensile ductility resulted from brittle, intergranular fracture of the brass. Once cracking started in the brass, cracks penetrated into the UHCS and premature failure resulted. Thus high elongations requires achieving high strain rate sensitivity as well as avoiding brittle fracture in the less ductile layer. In addition to tension, other deformation modes, including compression [3] and co-extrusion [4], have been studied for deformation response under conditions of high strain rate...|$|E
40|$|In {{subatomic}} particle physics, unstable particles {{can be studied}} with a so-called vertex detector placed inside a particle accelerator. A detecting unit close to the accelerator bunch of charged particles must {{be separated from the}} accelerator vacuum. A thin sheet with a complex 3 D shape prevents the detector vacuum from polluting the accelerator vacuum. Hence, this sheet should be completely leak tight with respect to gases. To produce such a complex thin sheet, superplastic forming can be very attractive if a small number of products is needed. This is a forming process in which a sheet of <b>superplastic</b> <b>material</b> is pressed into a one-sided die by means of gas pressure. In order to develop a material model which can be used in superplastic forming simulations, uniaxial and biaxial experiments are necessary. The uniaxial, tensile, experiments provide information about the one-dimensional material data, such as the stress as a function of equivalent plastic strain and strain rate. These data are extracted from the experiments by using inverse modeling, i. e. simulation of the tensile experiment. To fit these curves into a general material model, three parts in the uniaxial mechanical behavior are considered: initial flow stress, strain hardening and strain softening caused by void growth. Since failure in superplastic materials is preceded by the nucleation and growth of cavities inside the material, the void volume fractions of the tested specimens were also observed. A very important factor in this research is the study of the permeability of the formed sheet with respect to gas. If internal voids start to coalesce, through-thickness channels will start to form, thereby providing a gas leak path. To study the twodimensional behavior, including the gas leakage, bulge experiments were performed. Within these experiments, circular sheets were pressed into a cylindrically shaped die. From these experiments it followed that the plastic straining is dependent on an applied backpressure during the forming stage. This backpressure can postpone cavity nucleation and growth...|$|E
