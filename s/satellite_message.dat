How to simulate the ionospheric error {{is one of the}} key problems that need to be solved in high dynamic GPS signal simulator design. The ionospheric effects are related to the user's position. Based on the analysis to the different ionospheric time-delay error correction methods for ground users and space users, the approaches to calculate the ionospheric time-delay error in a high dynamic GPS signal simulator are studied and the mathematic models are also given in this paper. The calculation problem of eight ionospheric coefficients broadcasted in a GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>message</b> in different application situations is solved. The validity of the ionospheric time-delay error calculation methods given by this paper has been proved by simulations...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the need for {{increased}} communications capacity, NASA is conducting a program to develop technology and systems for a 30 / 20 GHz multibeam domestic U. S. satellite. One way to provide the required national interconnectivity is to permute and time share connections among the involved areas by means of a satellite-borne multiport microwave switch with a Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. In this connection, the question was analyzed whether a practical <b>satellite</b> <b>message</b> routing system can be developed using FDMA techniques. The total traffic (model A) was derived and used as an input specification for the satellite-routed FDMA study. Attention is given to beam isolations, color and regional systems, the level of service, and the color FDMA satellite. It is concluded that the FDMA system considered can handle substantially all the Customer Premises Service (CPS) and Trunking (TR) traffic in Model A.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the Symbol Error Probability (SEP) {{performance}} of a hybrid/integrated satellite-terrestrial cooperative network. In particular, {{we focus on the}} case of mobile relays that forward the satellite signal to a masked mobile destination node. The Selective Decode-and-Forward (SDF) transmission scheme is implemented and only the relay nodes which can successfully decode the <b>satellite</b> <b>message</b> are selected to retransmit the signal. The destination node exploits the spatial diversity advantages by implementing a typical Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) technique. The closed-form expressions for the exact average SEP of the arbitrary M-ary phase shift keying and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signaling with MRC diversity reception over independent but not necessarily identically distributed fading channels are derived using a Moment Generating Function (MGF) approach. These closed-form expressions are represented in terms of a finite sum of Lauricella hypergeometric functions. The analytical expressions show excellent agreement with the simulation results. Numerical results show that for a system using QPSK under the frequent heavy shadowed fading condition, the diversity gain of approximately 7 dB can be obtained at the SEP of 10 ^{- 1 } with respect to the direct transmission, when only one relay is used. It increases to around 12 dB in the case of 3 relays...|$|E

The current solution consists of a standalone data logger based monitoring system.

This paper presents an alternative satellite based WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) solution to this problem. The system described in this paper comprises a WSN with a three-part framework. The first part consists of sensor nodes monitoring rainfall, air temperature, air humidity, ambient light, wind speed, wind direction, soil temperature and soil moisture.

These data services will have extensive utility {{in a number of different}} applications, such as recovery of stolen property, tracking vehicles and cargoes, remote area positioning and messaging, personal communications, multiple data retrieval, and remote control of systems such as utilities. The market niche for STARSYS-type LEO satellite communications will consist of customers who can effectively employ short, inexpensive data messaging. STARSYS does not, therefore, compete directly with those systems which emphasize voice services. Moreover, with its design emphasis on inexpensive satellites and very low cost terminals, STARSYS will foster the creation of a completely different market of data messaging users, a mass market consisting of millions of commercial users around the globe. Additionally, nearly all of the applications envisioned by STARSYS for its commercial customers have corresponding utility in the government and military marketplaces. The concept of providing <b>satellite</b> <b>messaging</b> and positioning to individual user terminals has been attempted before, but satellite and user terminal costs were too expensive for mass market acceptance, and the services languished. Now, with the continually diminishing cost of sophisticated electronics, and the ability to use low-cost, low-earth orbit satellites, the commercialization of space communications for mass market use is on the threshold of being realized. STARSYS is a leader in the effort to bring two-way space-based data communication and positioning at an affordable cost to people and businesses around the globe.
