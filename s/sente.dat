5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. <b>Sente</b> Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E
25|$|Applying these {{concepts}} {{to a whole}} sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains <b>sente</b> in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses <b>sente</b> and takes gote. Accepting gote should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the yose (endgame) can consist of playing available <b>sente</b> sequences, and then taking the largest gote sequence on the board, though that description is a simplification. A reverse <b>sente</b> play is a special type of gote play, preventing the opponent from making some <b>sente</b> move. The relative value of reverse <b>sente</b> plays depends on the overall position, but one can count it as twice the value {{of what it would}} be if purely gote.|$|E
25|$|A {{player has}} <b>sente</b> {{if he does}} not {{currently}} need to respond to moves made by his opponent. This can be achieved by tenuki (ignoring the opponent), as a kind of gambit. A player can break out of gote, and gain <b>sente</b> by choosing to accept some future loss on the local level, in order to take the initiative to play elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Bally <b>Sente</b> {{released}} a Trivial Pursuit arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also released.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, a coin-operated arcade game {{based on}} the show was {{released}} by Bally <b>Sente,</b> created by Owen Rubin. The player's task was to guess the tune being played from among four choices. It also featured a two-player mode. While playable, some gamers consider the machine's difficulty to be high due to the technical limits of the very basic synthesized music the machine was capable of.|$|E
2500|$|Gote means [...] "succeeding move" [...] (lit: [...] "after hand"), the {{opposite}} of <b>sente,</b> meaning [...] "preceding move" [...] (lit: [...] "before hand"). <b>Sente</b> denotes which player has the initiative in the game, and which moves result in taking and holding the initiative. More precisely, as one player attacks in <b>sente,</b> the other defends in gote, {{it can be said}} that they respectively do and do not have the initiative. The situation of having <b>sente</b> is favorable, permitting control of the flow of the game.|$|E
2500|$|A {{move that}} {{overwhelmingly}} compels a player into a particular follow-up move {{is said to}} have [...] "sente" [...] (...) , or [...] "initiative"; the opponent has [...] "gote" [...] (...) [...] In most games, the player who maintains <b>sente</b> most of the time will win.|$|E
2500|$|Two players, Black and White (or <b>sente</b> and gote), {{play on a}} board {{composed}} of squares in a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) {{with a total of}} 361 squares. [...] The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color.|$|E
2500|$|Two players, Black and White (or 先手 <b>sente</b> and 後手 gote), {{play on a}} board ruled into a grid of 25 ranks (rows) and 25 files (columns), for a {{total of}} 625 squares. [...] The squares are {{undifferentiated}} by marking or color.|$|E
2500|$|He {{stated that}} it was {{important}} to balance training for self-defense with [...] "training the mind, or cultivating the precept karate-do ni <b>sente</b> nashi ('there is no first strike in karate')"; he also emphasized the importance of [...] "cultivating intellect before strength".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of Go, kiai (...) often {{translates}} as [...] "fighting spirit", i.e. aggressiveness or initiative, but not unthinking greed. Kiai means keeping <b>sente,</b> that is not letting the opponent have his or her way. A sensei might say, [...] "You play too passively — put some kiai in your moves!” A passive player may follow an opponent around the board responding to each move in turn. Kiai moves are the opposite of passive or submissive and a player showing kiai will dictate the flow of play. Kiai moves can catch an opponent off-balance and turn the game around. Examples of kiai moves include snatching <b>sente</b> away from the opponent; defending with a move that also counter-attacks; or answering a kikashi (forcing move) in an unexpected way.|$|E
2500|$|Two players, Black and White (or 先手 <b>sente</b> and 後手 gote), {{play on a}} board ruled into a grid of 12 ranks (rows) and 12 files (columns), with a {{total of}} 144 squares. [...] The squares are {{undifferentiated}} by marking or color, unlike a Western chess board.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} that neither player {{directly}} responds to the other's moves, the game can become difficult to analyze. [...] Though each player has gote on entering the turn, the move itself is <b>sente.</b> Such games often end in large exchanges, or one player will be shown to have a weaker position and eventually {{have to answer to}} avoid heavy damage.|$|E
2500|$|Tesuji {{is one of}} the {{important}} aspects of the game in which a player exerts his or her ability to [...] "read ahead". In the game of Go, they are used in life and death situations (tsumego), in order to obtain initiative (<b>sente),</b> to capture stones, to gain extra points in the yose, or to otherwise save a seemingly unfavorable situation.|$|E
2500|$|Announcing {{products}} early—months {{or years}} before their release date, also called [...] "preannouncing", {{has been an}} effective way by some developers to make their products successful. It {{can be seen as}} a legitimate part of their marketing strategy, but is generally not popular with industry press. The first company to release a product in a given market often gains an advantage. It can set the standard for similar future products, attract a large number of customers, and establish its brand before competitor's products are released. Public relations firm Coakley-Heagerty used an early announcement in 1984 to build interest among potential customers. Its client was Nolan Bushnell, formerly of Atari Inc. who wanted to promote the new <b>Sente</b> Technologies, but his contract with Atari prohibited doing so until a later date. The firm created an advertising campaign—including brochures and a shopping-mall appearance—around a large ambiguous box covered in brown paper to increase curiosity until <b>Sente</b> could be announced.|$|E
2500|$|Two players, Black and White (or 先手 <b>sente</b> and 後手 gote), {{play on a}} board {{composed}} of squares in a grid of 16 ranks (rows) by 16 files (columns) {{with a total of}} 256 squares. [...] The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. A pair of dots may be placed just beyond the fifth rank on each side to mark the promotion zones and aid in the initial setup of the two camps.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental Go, {{also called}} Coupon Go, [...] invented by Elwyn Berlekamp, adds {{an element of}} {{mathematical}} precision to the game by compelling players to make quantitative decisions. In lieu of playing a stone, a player may take the highest remaining card from a pack of cards valued in steps of ½ from ½ to 20: the player's score will be the territory captured, plus {{the total value of}} cards taken. In effect, the players participate in a downward auction for the number of points they think <b>sente</b> is worth at each stage in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Literally meaning 'an enlivenment', Kikashi (...) is a forcing move, {{usually one}} made outside the primary flow of play. Unlike <b>sente,</b> though, a move is kikashi when it yields a high {{efficiency}} in play by forcing the opponent to abandon {{a course of}} action. [...] A kikashi stone will usually be sacrificed while conferring an advantage; for example, the kikashi stone could act as a ladder breaker or destroy the opponent's potential eyeshape, while the answering move has no value at all.Moves can be kikashi, or not, depending on whether they are answered with appropriate sophistication or not. [...] If the answering move strengthens the position, then the play is not kikashi but aji keshi (ruining one's own potential).|$|E

6000|$|But {{no words}} {{can be so}} good to tell of all this as the words of Governor Bradford in his Historie of Plymouth Plantation, where he says that [...] "ther was a large companie of them purposed to get passage at Boston in Lincolnshire, and for that end had hired a shipe wholy to them selves, & made {{agreement}} with the maister to be ready at a certaine day, and take them and their goods in, at a conveniente place, wher they accordingly would all attende in readiness. So after long waiting, & large expences, though he kepte not day with them, yet he came at length & tooke them in, in the night. But when he had them & their goods abord, he betrayed them, haveing before hand complotted with the serchers & other officers so to doe; who tooke them, {{and put them into}} open boats, & ther rifled and ransaked them, searching them to their shirts for money, yea even the women furder then became modestie; and then caried them back into the towne, & made them a spectakle & wonder to the multitude, which came flocking on all sides to behould them. Being thus first, by the catchpoule officer, rifled, & stripte of their money, books, and much other goods, they were presented to the magistrates, and messengers <b>sente</b> to informe the lords of the Counsell of them; and so they were comited to ward. Indeed the magistrats used them courteously, and shewed them what favour they could; but could not deliver them till order came from the Counsell-table. But the issue was that after a months imprisonmente, the greatest parte were dismiste, & sent to the places from whence they came; but 7. of the principall were still kept in prison, and bound over to the Assises." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{substitution}} of some venomous reptile for food, or {{putting it into}} liquor, was anciently {{supposed to be a}} common mode of administering poison; as appears from the following curious account of the death of King John, extracted from a MS. Chronicle of England, penes John Clerk, esq. advocate. [...] "And, in the same tyme, the pope <b>sente</b> into Englond a legate, that men cald Swals, and he was prest cardinal of Rome, for to mayntene King Johnes cause agens the barons of Englond; but the barons had so much pte (poustie, i.e. power) through Lewys, the kinges sone of Fraunce, that King Johne wist not wher for to wend ne gone: and so hitt fell, that he wold have gone to Suchold; and as he went thedurward, he come by the abbey of Swinshed, and ther he abode II dayes. And, as he sate at meat, he askyd a monke of the house, how moche a lofe was worth, that was before hym sete at the table? and the monke sayd that loffe was worthe bot ane halfpenny. 'O!' quod the kyng, 'this is a grette cheppe of brede; now,' said the king, 'and yff I may, such a loffe shalle be worth xxd. or half a yer be gone:' and when he said the word, muche he thought, and ofte tymes sighed, and nome and ete of the bred, and said, 'By Gode, the word that I have spokyn shall be sothe.' The monke, that stode befor the kyng, was ful sory in his hert; and thought rather he wold himself suffer peteous deth; and thought yff he myght ordeyn therfore sum remedy. And anon the monke went unto his abbott, and was schryvyd of him, and told the abbott all that the kyng said, and prayed his abbott to assoyl him, for he wold gyffe the kyng such a wassayle, that all Englond shuld be glad and joyful therof. Tho went the monke into a gardene, and fond a tode therin; and toke her upp, and put hyr in a cuppe, and filled it with good ale, and pryked hyr in every place, in the cuppe, till the venome come out in every place; an brought hitt befor the kyng, and knelyd, and said, 'Sir, wassayle; for never in your lyfe drancke ye of such a cuppe,' 'Begyne, monke,' quod the king; and the monke dranke a gret draute, and toke the kyng the cuppe, and the kyng also drank a grett draute, and set downe the cuppe.--The monke anon went to the Farmarye, and ther dyed anon, on whose soule God have mercy, Amen. And v monkes syng for his soule especially, and shall while the abbey stondith. The kyng was anon ful evil at ese, and comaunded to remove the table, and askyd after the monke; and men told him that he was ded, for his wombe was broke in sondur. When the king herd this tidyng, he comaunded for to trusse; but all hit was for nought, for his bely began to swelle for the drink that he dranke, that he dyed within II dayes, the moro aftur Seynt Luke's day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The nexte spring after," [...] as Bradford {{continues}} {{the narrative of}} their sorrows, [...] "ther was another attempte made by some of these & others, to get over at an other place. And so it fell out, that they light of a Dutchman at Hull, having a ship of his owne belonging to Zealand; they made agreements with him, and acquainted him with their condition, hoping to find more faithfullnes in him, then in the former of their owne nation. He bad them not fear, for he would doe well enough. He was by appointment to take them in betweene Grimsbe & Hull, where was a large comone a good way distante from any towne. Now against the prefixed time, the women & children, with the goods, {{were sent to the}} place in a small barke, which they had hired for that end; and the men were to meete them by land. But it so fell out, that they were ther a day before the shipe came, and the sea being rough, and the women very sicke, prevailed with the seamen to put into a creeke hardby, wher they lay on ground at lowwater. The nexte morning the shipe came, but they were fast, & could not stir till about noone. In the mean time, the shipe maister, perceiveing how the matter was, <b>sente</b> his boate to be getting the men abord whom he saw ready, walking aboute the shore. But after the first boat full was gott abord, & she was ready to goe for more, the Mr. espied a greate company, both horse & foote, with bills, & gunes, & other weapons; for the countrie was raised to take them. The Dutchman seeing this swore his countries oath, 'sacremente,' and having the wind faire, waiged his Ancor, hoysed sayles, & away. But the poore men which were gott abord, were in great distress for their wives and children, which they saw thus to be taken, and were left destitute of their helps; and them selves also, not having a cloath to shifte them with, more then they had on their baks, & some scarce a peney aboute them, all they had being abord the barke. It drew tears from their eyes, and any thing they had they would have given to have been a shore againe; but all in vaine, ther was no remedy, they must thus sadly part. The rest of the men there were in greatest danger, made shift to escape away before the troope could surprise them: those only staying that best might, to be assistante unto the women. But pitifull it was to see the heavie case of these poore women in this distress: what weeping & crying on every side, some for their husbands, that were carried away in the ship as is before related; others not knowing what should become of them, & their little ones; others again melted in teares, seeing their poore little ones hanging aboute them, crying for feare, and quaking with could. Being thus aprehanded, they hurried from one place to another, and from one justice to another, till in the ende they knew not what to doe with them; for to imprison so many women & innocent children for no other cause (many of them) but that they must goo with their husbands, seemed to be unreasonable and all would crie out of them; and to send them home againe was as difficult, for they aleged, as the trueth was, they had no homes to goe to, for they had either sould, or otherwise disposed of their houses & livings. To be shorte, after they had been thus turmoyled a good while, and conveyed from one constable to another, they were glad to be ridd of them in the end upon any termes: for all were wearied & tired with them. Though in the mean time they (poore soules) indured miserie enough; and thus in the end necessitie forste a way for them." ...|$|E

I was of counsaill with the marshallis at th' ordering of our lodgingg, and our campe was soo well envirowned with ordynance, carts, and dikes, that hard it was to entre or issue, but at certain places appointed for that purpos, and assigned the mooste commodious place of the saide campe for my Lord Dacre company, next the water, and next my Lord of Westmoreland.

At which skyrmyshe, my seid Lord Dacre, and his brother, Sir Cristofer, Sir Arthure, and Sir Marmaduke, and many other gentilmen, did marvellously hardly; and found the best resistence that hath been seen with my comyng to their parties, and above xxxii Scottis sleyne, and not passing iiij Englishmen, but above lx hurt. Aftir that, my seid lord retournyng to the campe, wold in nowise bee lodged in the same, but where he laye the furst nyght. And he being with me at souper, about viij a clok, the horses of his company brak lowse, and sodenly ran out of his feld, in such nombre, that it caused a marvellous alarome in our feld; and our standing watche being set, the horses cam ronnyng along the campe, at whome were shot above one hundred shief of arrowes, and dyvers gonnys, thinking they had been Scotts, that wold have saulted the campe; fynally the horses were soo madde, that they ran like wild dere into the feld; above xv c. at the leest, in dyvers companys, and, in one place, above I felle downe a gret rok, and slewe theymself, and above ij c. ran into the towne being on fire, and by the women taken, and carried awaye right evill brent, and many were taken agayne.
