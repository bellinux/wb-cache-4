50|$|Though {{there is}} {{no change in the}} diet between sex and depth, there is a change in diet {{when it comes to the}} {{maturity}} of the fish. When the fish are young most of their diet is made up of small crustaceans and as the individuals mature they start to consume larger crustaceans and small fish.   When reaching maturity they consume larger fish and the left over fish from predators and commercial fishing.  Mature Dipturus innominatus no longer eat crustaceans that once were the majority their diet when they were younger.  This change of diet in regards to size/maturity is also show in the skate species Sympterygia acuta, which follow a very similar diet pattern to New Zealand <b>smooth</b> <b>skate.</b>|$|E
40|$|Resource {{managers}} need climate adaptation tools. We {{build on}} a popular tool, {{the climate change}} vulnerability assessment (CCVA), to identify vulnerable marine species. Only warming was considered, as warming {{is expected to have}} earlier impacts in the offshore than other climate drivers, and projections of other climate drivers are not well developed. For this reason, we coin our generalized, semi-quantitative method the “Vulnerability to Projected Warming Assessment ” (VPWA) as opposed to using the broader term, CCVA. We refine the typical “exposure ” com-ponent to be a function of gain/loss of thermal habitat atmultiple life stages. Wealsobuild on the traditional logic approachofCCVAs. Weproduce scores for each species, and use a null distribution through Monte Carlo simulations to identify the most vulnerable species. We evaluate the vulnerability of 33 fish and invertebrate species, on the scale of the Scotian Shelf, Canada, to two warming scenarios, mild and severe, based on regional trends and projections. At smaller spatial scales, we evaluate populations of a subset of these species. Populations in the southwest portion of the domain are found to be more vulnerable than those in the northeast. Overall, our results indicate that 45 % of populations may be vulnerable under a severe (+ 38 C) warming scenario, including currently endangered, threatened, and commercial populations (e. g. south-western Atlantic cod, <b>Smooth</b> <b>skate,</b> Snow crab), while only one species has a relatively high vulnerability score under the mild (+ 0. 78 C) scenari...|$|E
40|$|Three {{species of}} skates {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: thorny skate Amblyraja radiata, winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, and <b>smooth</b> <b>skate</b> Malacoraja senta. Trends in their abundance and size are described using data from annual bottom-trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Biomass and the abundance of mature skates decreased over the 1971 – 2002 period, by 80 – 90 % for thorny and winter skates, {{and to a lesser}} degree for smooth skates. Abundance of juvenile thorny and smooth skates increased from the mid- 1980 s to a peak in the mid- 1990 s, and then declined in the late 1990 s. Mean length decreased by 20 – 30 % during the 1980 s {{for each of the three}} species. The increase in the abundance of juvenile skates in the 1990 s coincided with a collapse in the biomass of large-bodied demersal teleost fishes, a dramatic decline in fishing effort, a cooling of the cold intermediate layer in the southern Gulf and decreasing abundance of mature skates. The decline in the abundance of large skates may be an effect of fishing, though reported landings of skates have been low. These results for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence contrast those observed on Georges Bank and in the North Sea, where small elasmobranch species that were not targeted by fisheries increased in biomass as the biomass of heavily exploited groundfish stocks declined.

The bath attendant's duties included maintenance of the wider Pells grounds and pond. In very cold winters, the pond and wetlands froze and could be skated on. The water in the swimming baths made a better and <b>smoother</b> <b>skating</b> surface, and it was lowered to allow it to freeze, with tickets sold for 2d at the baths.

40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five skate species- thorny (Amblyraja radiata), Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for thorny and Arctic skates were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for <b>smooth</b> <b>skate.</b> Round skate has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for Arctic skate. Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. Thorny skate showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and round skate did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO.

40|$|C The NEFSC should {{continue}} to use the trawl survey data for New England groundfish stock assessment unadjusted, because such use is scientifically justifiable. Payne Summary Point 1, page 3 C There {{appears to be no}} systematic change in trawl survey performance in the period covered by the offset trawl warps. Bell, page 2 C Conversion coefficients, for use in assessments, should be determined for stocks for which the catch results from optimal and suboptimal gear settings differed most Payne Summary Point 5, page 4 C However, given that there is no consistent differences between the “optimal ” and “worst case ” trawls (i. e. some positive, some negative), there are no grounds for modifying the survey results except for those where significant changes were detected. In these instances, conversion coefficients should be determined. Bell, page 6 The NEFSC agrees with the conclusions of the reviewers that effects of trawl warp offsets are minimal and likely within the magnitude of survey variability for most species. The recommendation to use the unadjusted trawl survey indices for regulated groundfish stocks has been followed. The species where significant differences were detected are not regulated groundfish species (i. e., sea scallop, herring, Loligo, <b>smooth</b> <b>skate</b> and winter skate). Calculating conversion coefficients for these species using only the data from the experiment would not be technically appropriate due to the multiple gear modifications in the experimental treatment and the associated concerns raised by all reviewers. Additional experimentation at different depths and warp offsets is necessary to estimate calibration coefficients, and might be possible with cooperative research projects. Group 2 ! The sensitivity tests carried out to evaluate the implications of the trawl warp offsets for the evaluation of stock status and rebuilding plans adequately bounded the range of potential introduced biases. Payne, Summary Point 1, page 3 C Yes, the 10, 25 and 100 % were reasonable magnitudes. Although, the magnitudes were all in the same direction, I acted under the assumption that the misconfigured gear had lower efficiency. In light of the number of instances wher...|$|E

40|$|Mature thorny (Amblyraja radiata), winter (Leucoraja ocellata), and <b>smooth</b> (Malacoraja senta) <b>skates</b> have {{declined}} to very low abundance in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (SGSL) and on the eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS). We used stage-structured state-space models to examine decadal patterns in mortality rates in these skates. Mortality at early life stages (embryos in egg cases, hatchlings, and (or) small juveniles) appeared to decrease between the 1970 s and the 2000 s. In contrast, estimated mortality rates increased for larger individuals over this period. Although potentially confounded in models with effects of any changes in juvenile growth, the estimated increases in mortality could not instead be attributed solely to changes in growth. Increases in the mortality of large individuals appeared to reflect increases in natural mortality, possibly due to predation by grey seals. Increases in natural mortality were not evident for skates on the neighbouring western Scotian Shelf, where grey seal abundance has remained lower. Even {{in the absence of}} fishing, recovery of skates is unlikely under current ecosystem conditions in the SGSL and on the ESS. 16 page(s...|$|R
