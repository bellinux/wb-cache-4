500|$|The piles support two river piers, two shore piers and two abutments. The bridge's support columns on the piers were {{designed}} in a triangular form, larger {{at the top}} than at the bottom, each carrying two of the bridge's beams, so as to not completely obstruct the view through the bridge's piers. These columns support the bridge's five spans: a central span of , two flanking spans of [...] each and two smaller spans of [...] at each end passing over roadways. The bridge has eight parallel lines of beams. Each line of beams consists of two cantilever spans [...] long suspended between the shore and river piers, a central <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> [...] long between the two river piers, and two [...] spans suspended over roadways at either end. Suspended between the beams of the bridge were [...] of [...] water mains pipes and [...] of [...] gas and drainage pipes.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{as built}} was {{composed}} of fixed and <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> roughly 75 ft long and piers 90 ft apart, center to center. The span lengths alternated between 75 and 105 ft.

5000|$|After {{the failure}} of the Mianus River Bridge at Greenwich, Connecticut in 1983, the Harvard Bridge was shut down and {{inspected}} because it contained similar elements, specifically the <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> [...] Traffic was restricted to the inner two lanes due to the discovery of two failed hangers on span 14. A few days later, all trucks and buses were banned from the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} span was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main span that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder span in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main span is flanked by two orthotropic back spans which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side spans on the approach to each back span. Each of these side spans are 292 ft long. Although these spans appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor <b>spans</b> and <b>suspended</b> <b>spans.</b> Anchor spans rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor spans. There are an additional nine 208 ft steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from 186 - 208 ft. The bridge carries about 93,000 cars and other vehicles on a typical day, almost double its original projected design capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day.|$|R
50|$|As the {{caissons}} {{were being}} {{sunk into the}} riverbed, the piers were being built on top of them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. The piers were masonry blocks of granite backed with concrete. The piers of the Harahan were located directly upstream of the piers of the Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved 17 feet toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> and three cantilevered arms identically.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, the {{erection}} of the cantilevered arms was commenced and {{was completed}} in mid-summer of 1941. The two halves of the <b>suspended</b> <b>span,</b> each 282 feet (86 m) long and weighing 2,000 tons, were built in December 1941. The bridge was erected by commencing at the two anchor spans and advancing towards the center, {{with the use of}} creeper cranes moving along the upper chord. 16 hydraulic jacks, each of which had an 800-ton capacity, were pressed into service to join the two halves of the <b>suspended</b> <b>span.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Barito Bridge is {{the third}} longest <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> in Indonesia a length of 230 meters after Kutai Kartanegara Bridge (270 meters) and Mamberamo Bridge (235 meters). The Kutai Kartanegara Bridge {{collapsed}} in November 2011.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{measures}} 1200 m {{with the}} total of all <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> being 739.9 m in length, carrying four traffic lanes with posted speed limits of 70 km/h. It was designed with a maximum road gradient of 4 percent. It is notable as having been the first bridge built in North America using an orthotropic steel deck, which yielded a completed structure having half the overall mass of the Macdonald Bridge nearby. Engineering of the bridge also employed the pioneering use of wind tunnel testing which considered the impact of winds on the structure both during construction and when complete.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 2015 {{another major}} {{renovation}} of the bridge started which saw the temporary removal of the pedway and bike lanes. At a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that makes up the <b>suspended</b> <b>spans,</b> except the towers and two main cables, were replaced; the non-suspended approach spans remained. New vertical cables were required due to the relocation of the stiffening trusses from above deck level to below deck level. Construction mostly occurred overnight with the bridge open to traffic during the day, but many full-weekend closures were necessary. the replacement portion {{of the project was}} completed in February 2017.|$|R

5000|$|The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, {{known locally}} as the Macdonald Bridge or the [...] "old bridge", was opened on April 2, 1955. The bridge was {{designed}} by Phillip Pratley, a bridge designer also responsible for the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver. The Macdonald Bridge often suffered from traffic problems due to its narrow width, so a lane addition project was completed in 1999. In 2015 the suspended portion of the bridge will be replaced: that includes the floor beams, the stiffening trusses, road deck and suspender ropes. Once complete the only original components on the suspended structure will be the main cable, the two towers, the anchor piers and cable bents. It {{is only the second}} time ever that the <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> of a bridge will be replaced while being open for traffic during the day. The first time was on the Lions Gate Bridge.|$|R

The bridge separates the inner harbor (north of the bridge) of the Port of Long Beach from the middle harbor.|$|R
25|$|In 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was {{organized}} {{to finance the}} construction. Among the prominent backers was Henry Clay Frick, the coal tycoon and associate of Andrew Carnegie. The Union Bridge Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which had completed the Michigan Central cantilever bridge at Niagara (see Niagara Cantilever Bridge), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by Charles Macdonald and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction {{was carried out by}} constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (<b>suspended)</b> <b>spans</b> floated out or raised with falsework. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.|$|R
50|$|Upon completion, {{the bridge}} had the longest <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> and the longest main span in Continental Europe, the world's longest {{continuous}} truss, and the world's deepest bridge foundation.

50|$|A pin and hanger {{assembly}} {{is used to}} connect two plate girders of a bridge. These assemblies are used to provide an expansion joint in the bridge. One beam (the anchor span) is set on a pier with a short section cantilevered out toward the next pier. The other (the <b>suspended</b> <b>span)</b> begins underneath the anchor span, and has its far end resting on the next pier. The beams have holes directly above each other. The two holes are connected using hangers, a pair of connecting plates sandwiching the bridge girders. A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the <b>suspended</b> <b>span</b> while allowing it to move longitudinally. Large washers are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers. Exceptionally long spans may have two sets of girders cantilevered from opposite bridge piers with a third set of girders suspended by pin and hanger assemblies from both cantilevers.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge over}} the Detroit River had the longest <b>suspended</b> central <b>span</b> in the world when it was {{completed}} in 1929—1,850 ft. This was a record until the George Washington Bridge opened between New York and New Jersey in 1931. The bridge's total length is 7,500 feet (2,286 m). Construction began in 1927 and was completed in 1929. The architect was the McClintic-Marshall Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|R

40|$|The Triborough Bridge {{connects the}} boroughs of Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx in New York City. The bridge has <b>suspended</b> <b>spans</b> {{with a total}} length of 2, 700 feet (823 m). The {{existing}} concrete deck is being replaced with an orthotropic steel deck to reduce the overall dead load. Prior to the deck replacement, a prototype steel orthotropic deck was installed on the main span for a length of 120 feet (36. 6 m). Approximately 300 strain gages were installed at critical locations to investigate the fatigue strength under static and dynamic loads of the AASHTO fatigue truck and under normal traffic. The strain gage testing was done in three phases while structural refinements {{were made to the}} deck system between phases. Traffic monitoring was conducted for the most critical locations over a thirty-day period during Phase III. The results from three phases of the strain gage testing, including influence lines and traffic monitoring data, were used to calculate fatigue stress ranges and the fatigue life for each detail. In addition to strain gage testing, a finite element analysis of the orthotropic deck was performed using loading criteria set by AASHTO – LRFD. The results from the finite elemen...|$|R
