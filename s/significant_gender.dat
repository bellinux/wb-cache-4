The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle {{for at least some}} of the males analysed.|$|E
5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, {{more than in}} previous elections that the party had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, {{but there was no}} <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> difference.

25|$|The {{study found}} that when mental {{rotation}} {{is used as a}} predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern.

However, an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability.

25|$|These large {{disparities in}} income size and {{relative}} size to men {{in addition to}} low overall labor involvement, few salaried positions, {{and high levels of}} unemployment suggest that these nations' economies perpetuate <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> disparities. However, low wages and large wage gaps {{can be explained by the}} different types of work men and women perform in these countries. If women are hired for mostly low-skill, low-wage work which is less productive and less elastic in demand than the work of most men, then their wages should be low and be significantly smaller than men's wages. Furthermore, a large supply of female labor for the few jobs women do work in these various economies may be depressing wages.|$|E

25|$|The {{birthday}} effect (sometimes {{called the}} birthday blues, especially when referring specifically to suicide) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on {{or close to}} their birthday. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in England and Wales, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United States, {{as well as in}} smaller populations such as Major League Baseball players. Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge {{in the run-up to the}} birthday, while others find no <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> effect. Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased mortality salience, or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.|$|E

General health practices awareness had a <b>significant</b> relation to <b>gender,</b> living arrangements and ethno-cultural group. Safety had a <b>significant</b> relation to <b>gender,</b> ethno-cultural group and risk status. Nutrition, social support and stress management had a <b>significant</b> relation to <b>gender.</b> Nutrition, physical participation, general health practices awareness and safety were significantly negatively correlated to age. Physical participation, social support, stress management, identity awareness, and safety were significantly positively correlated to grade average and parent education. Hierarchical regressionanalyses indicated that demographic and psychosocial variables made a statistically significant contribution to predicting a health-promoting lifestyle. These findings are discussed in relation to efforts to enhance health-promoting behaviors in adolescents. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E
25|$|The Benton Visual Retention Test is an {{assessment}} of visual perception, and visual memory abilities. More than 50 years of proven clinical use is the staple of the Benton Visual Retention Test. This test has proven its sensitivity to reading disabilities, nonverbal learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, attention-deficit disorder, alzheimer's, {{and other forms of}} dementia. During testing participants are presented with 10 cards for 10 seconds with unique designs on each. After the time has passed participants are asked to immediately reproduce the designs from each card using their visual memory. In the second stage participants are asked to copy each of the 10 card designs while the cards are in view. The participants results from each task are then assessed and placed into six categories; omissions, distortions, preservations, rotations, misplacements, and sizing errors. The further the participant’s scores varies from the averages provided in the Benton Visual Retention Test manual the worse the participant is assessed to be on visual memory ability. The Benton Visual Retention Test {{has proved to be a}} generalizable test with the ability to be accurately administered to participants aged 8-adult, and no gender effect. Some studies have suggested a <b>significant</b> <b>gender</b> and education interaction indicating that an age-associated decline in visual memory performance may be more prominent for those individuals with a lower education level.|$|E
25|$|Medieval England was {{a patriarchal}} {{society and the}} lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied according to factors including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. <b>Significant</b> <b>gender</b> inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men. After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of the}} development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E

40|$|Grades provide {{students}} with their primary performance feedback: signals which affect academic choices. Variations in grading practice among courses impose grade penalties (and bonuses) on students who take them. These grade penalties are sometimes gendered. Using extensive data from the University of Michigan, we report on patterns of grade penalty and gendered performance difference across 116 large courses. We find that <b>significant</b> <b>gendered</b> performance differences are ubiquitous in large introductory STEM lecture courses. They are largely absent in both STEM labs and in lecture courses in other disciplines. Exploring the features of these courses, we hypothesize that evaluation methods used in STEM lecture courses interact with stereotype threat to create these gendered performance differences.

40|$|Extract] In {{this chapter}} we explore {{some of the}} issues {{concerning}} men working in the human services. It is an area that has traditionally been seen as women's work {{and there has been a}} <b>significant</b> <b>gendered</b> pattern of employment (see Christie 1998). Men are clustered in certain areas of practice and in particular positions such as management. This is not a new phenomenon and has been a major issue of debate in the last 35 years (see Lawrence 1965; Walton 1975; Camilleri 1996; Christie 1998). In addressing these issues, we examine the labour force participation in the community service sector; the issues of gender in the construction of 'care' (in particular how patriarchal discourse has structured the possibilities of men's and women's work); and issues and contradictions of men who remain in direct practice...|$|R

This paper investigates Chinese women's experiences of WFC in {{the fastest growing}} commercial airline sector in the world.

Liberalization, competition and commercialization have also had a <b>significant</b> <b>gendered</b> impact on jobs. The latter resulting in the commodification of women's aesthetic and emotional labour, job segregation, employment insecurity, poor career opportunities and increased WFC. We explore reasons why HR policies and practices in airlines fail to address women's workplace concerns and find that occupational status and lack of organizational power, together with the prevalence of traditional gendered norms and attitudes, play important role...|$|R
