5|$|Unlike in {{standard}} first-person shooters, the player must control a flying ship {{that has a}} <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> movement scheme, allowing the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. In addition to a single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete {{against each other in}} eight different game types.

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters {{in that it}} allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles {{made it impossible for}} riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We are {{developing}} an autonomous mobile robotic system to emulate <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> relative spacecraft motion during proximity operations. A mobile omni-directional base robot provides x, y, and yaw planar motion with moderate accuracy through six independently driven motors. With a <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> micro-positioning Stewart platform {{on top of}} the moving base, <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> spacecraft motion can be emulated with high accuracy. This paper presents our approach to dynamic modeling, control, and simulation for the overall system. Compared with other simulations that introduced significant simplifications, we believe that our rigorous modeling approach is crucial for the high fidelity hardware in-the-loop emulation.

40|$|An amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> {{helicopter}} {{stability and}} control derivative model {{was developed in}} which body acceleration and control rate derivatives {{were included in the}} Taylor series expansion. These additional derivatives were derived from consideration {{of the effects of the}} higher order rotor flapping dynamics, which are known to be inadequately represented in the conventional <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> quasistatic stability derivative model. The amended model was a substantial improvement over the conventional model, effectively doubling the unsable bandwidth and providing a more accurate representation of the short period and cross axis characteristics. Further investigations assessed the applicability of the two stability derivative model structures for flight test parameter identification. Parameters were identified using simulation data generated from a higher order base line model having sixth order rotor tip path plane dynamics. Three lower order models were identified: one using the conventional stability derivative model structure, a second using the amended <b>six</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> model structure, and a third model having eight <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> that included a simplified rotor tip path plane tilt representation...|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a typical}} multibody system. It is usually denoted as slider-crank mechanism. The mechanism {{is used to}} transform rotational motion into translational motion {{by means of a}} rotating driving beam, a connection rod and a sliding body. In the present example, a flexible body is used for the connection rod. The sliding mass is not allowed to rotate and three revolute joints are used to connect the bodies. While each body has <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> in space, the kinematical conditions lead to one degree of freedom for the whole system.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} (1,2) are represented by means of redundant coordinates, meaning that the coordinates are not independent. This can be exemplified by the slider-crank mechanism shown above, where each body has <b>six</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> {{while most of the}} coordinates are dependent on the motion of the other bodies. For example, 18 coordinates and 17 constraints could be used to describe the motion of the slider-crank with rigid bodies. However, as there is only one degree of freedom, the equation of motion could be also represented by means of one equation and one degree of freedom, using e.g. the angle of the driving link as degree of freedom. The latter formulation has then the minimum number of coordinates in order to describe the motion of the system and can be thus called a minimal coordinates formulation. The transformation of redundant coordinates to minimal coordinates is sometimes cumbersome and only possible in the case of holonomic constraints and without kinematical loops. Several algorithms have been developed for the derivation of minimal coordinate {{equations of motion}}, to mention only the so-called recursive formulation. The resulting equations are easier to be solved because in the absence of constraint conditions, standard time integration methods can be used to integrate the equations of motion in time. While the reduced system might be solved more efficiently, the transformation of the coordinates might be computationally expensive. In very general multibody system formulations and software systems, redundant coordinates are used {{in order to make the}} systems user-friendly and flexible.|$|E

The most praised aspects of the game were its graphics, artificial intelligence of enemies, and outdoor environments. IGN reviewer Jay Boor lauded the game's new engine, noting that the transition between indoor and outdoor environments is seamless. Game Revolution remarked that the addition of outdoor environments [...] "allows for an even greater use of the maneuvering capabilities, adds variety to the levels, and ensures that the game never gets dull or boring".

2500|$|In 1988, Arsys Software's Star Cruiser was an {{innovative}} action RPG released for the PC-8801.

The game also emphasized storytelling, with plot twists and extensive character dialogues, taking place in a futuristic science fiction setting. It won the 1988 Game of the Year awards from the Japanese computer game magazines [...] and [...] Star Cruiser was later ported to the Mega Drive console in 1990. Another 1988 release, Last Armageddon, produced for the PC-8801 and later ported to the PC Engine CD and NES consoles in 1990, featured a unique post-apocalyptic storyline set in a desolate future where humanity has become extinct and the protagonists are demon monsters waging war against an alien species. The Scheme, released by Bothtec for the PC-8801 in 1988, was an action RPG with a similar side-scrolling open-world gameplay to Metroid. That same year, [...] introduced the unique ability to transform into a monster, which allows the player to both scare human non-player characters for unique dialogues as well as interact with all the monsters. This is a recurring highlight in the series, offering the player insight into the enemies, to an extent that very few other games allow to this day. Also that same year, War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned certain RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted more action-adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor.|$|E
