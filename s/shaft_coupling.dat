40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} blades with {{integral}} shrouds, for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds. In long blades of low pressure stages the forcing can be obtained by the untwisting of twisted blades due to the effect of the huge centrifugal forces. The dynamic behavior of these blade rows is difficult to predict due to the nonlinear effect of the contact forces and due to friction. Different models for the contact are proposed and compared. The resulting natural frequencies of the blade row as a function of the different nodal diameter mode shapes are highly depending on the assumed models. For avoiding resonant conditions with engine order excitations, the natural frequencies must be calculated with good accuracy. Some of the modes of the blade row, typically for the last stage of the low pressure steam turbine, can couple with some vibration modes of the rotor: flexural vibrations of the <b>shaft</b> <b>couple</b> with 1 nodal diameter mode shape of the row in axial direction and torsional vibrations of the <b>shaft</b> <b>couple</b> with the 0 nodal diameter mode in tangential direction. Therefore analyses of lateral and torsional vibrations of low pressure steam turbine shafts require also an accurate analysis of the blade row vibration modes...|$|R
30|$|Rotating {{electrical}} machinery, such as synchronous turbogenerators, {{synchronous machine}} (SM), and induction machine (IM) loads will {{all contribute to}} system inertia. For the SM, {{this is due to}} the rotor <b>shaft</b> being synchronously <b>coupled</b> to the stator field. In the IM case, the rotor <b>shaft</b> is <b>coupled</b> to the stator field asynchronously depending on the slip. Conversely, variable-speed wind turbines do not contribute toward system inertia. This is because such turbines employ a power electronic converter to control the electromagnetic torque for variable-speed operation. This decouples the rotor speed from changes in the system frequency.|$|R

50|$|As surface {{alluvial}} gold ran out, gold seekers {{were forced}} to look further underground. Miners discovered so-called deep leads, which were gold-bearing watercourses that had been buried at various depths by centuries of silting and, in some Victorian goldfields such as Ballarat, volcanic action. They also began to exploit the underground gold reefs which were the original sources of the gold. Deep mining was more difficult and dangerous. Places such as Bendigo and Ballarat saw great concentrations of miners, who were forming partnerships and syndicates {{to enable them to}} sink ever-deeper <b>shafts.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with erratic and vexatious policing and licence checks, tensions flared around Beechworth, Bendigo and Ballarat.
