2500|$|<b>Subtractive</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{is based}} on {{filtering}} harmonically rich waveforms. [...] It is implemented in early synthesizers such as the Moog synthesizer. [...] Subtractive synthesizers approximate instrumental sounds by a signal generator (producing sawtooth waves, square waves, etc.) followed by a filter. [...] The combination of simple modulation routings (such as pulse width modulation and oscillator sync), along with the lowpass filter, {{is responsible for the}} [...] "classic synthesizer" [...] sound commonly associated with [...] "analog synthesis." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, with {{significant}} new supporting evidence, {{it was reported}} {{on the pages of}} Popular Science Monthly that the human vocal cords function like a fire siren to produce a harmonic-rich tone, which is then filtered by the vocal tract to produce different vowel tones. By the time, the additive Hammond organ was already on market. Most early electronic organ makers thought it too expensive to manufacture the plurality of oscillators required by additive organs, and began instead to build subtractive ones. In a 1940 Institute of Radio Engineers meeting, the head field engineer of Hammond elaborated on the company's new Novachord as having a “subtractive system” in contrast to the original Hammond organ in which “the final tones were built up by combining sound waves”. Alan Douglas used the qualifiers additive and subtractive to describe different types of electronic organs in a 1948 paper presented to the Royal Musical Association. [...] The contemporary wording additive synthesis and <b>subtractive</b> <b>synthesis</b> can be found in his 1957 book The electrical production of music, in which he categorically lists three methods of forming of musical tone-colours, in sections titled Additive synthesis, <b>Subtractive</b> <b>synthesis,</b> and Other forms of combinations.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{oscillators}} – create raw sounds with a timbre {{that depends}} upon the waveform generated. [...] Voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) and digital oscillators may be used. [...] Harmonic additive synthesis models sounds directly from pure sine waves, somewhat {{in the manner of}} an organ, while frequency modulation and phase distortion [...] synthesis use one oscillator to modulate another. <b>Subtractive</b> <b>synthesis</b> depends upon filtering a harmonically rich oscillator waveform. Sample-based and granular synthesis use one or more digitally recorded sounds in place of an oscillator.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{expiration}} of the Stanford University FM patent in 1995, digital FM synthesis {{can now be}} implemented freely by other manufacturers. The FM synthesis patent brought Stanford $20 million before it expired, making it (in 1994) [...] "the second most lucrative licensing agreement in Stanford's history". FM today is mostly found in software-based synths such as FM8 by Native Instruments or Sytrus by Image-Line, {{but it has also}} been incorporated into the synthesis repertoire of some modern digital synthesizers, usually coexisting as an option alongside other methods of <b>synthesis</b> such as <b>subtractive,</b> sample-based <b>synthesis,</b> additive synthesis, and other techniques. The degree of complexity of the FM in such hardware synths may vary from simple 2-operator FM, to the highly flexible 6-operator engines of the Korg Kronos and Alesis Fusion, to creation of FM in extensively modular engines such as those in the latest synthesisers by Kurzweil Music Systems.|$|R

However, despite the clearly defined requirements of naturalness and flexibility, no automatic method has yet found widespread use. After clarifying the definition, terminology, and usages of sound texture synthesis, we will give {{an overview of the}} many existing methods and approaches, and the few available software implementations, and classify them by the synthesis model they are based on, such as <b>subtractive</b> or additive <b>synthesis,</b> granular synthesis, corpus-based concatenative synthesis, wavelets, or physical modeling.

The {{introduction}} of the theoretical part deals with the basic terminology of modular synthesizers and their history and classification. The thesis also presents and characterizes the methods of producing sound focusing on additive, <b>subtractive</b> and modulation <b>synthesis.</b> From the fundamental components of a subtractive synthesizer, the thesis describes a voltage controlled filter, voltage controlled oscillator, low frequency oscillator and voltage controlled amplifier.

2500|$|Additive {{synthesis}} {{more broadly}} may mean sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements {{to create more}} complex timbres, even when the elements are not sine waves. For example, F. Richard Moore listed additive synthesis {{as one of the}} [...] "four basic categories" [...] of sound synthesis alongside <b>subtractive</b> <b>synthesis,</b> nonlinear synthesis, and physical modeling. In this broad sense, pipe organs, which also have pipes producing non-sinusoidal waveforms, can be considered as a variant form of additive synthesizers. Summation of principal components and Walsh functions have also been classified as additive synthesis.|$|E

These instruments produce sound in various ways, through <b>subtractive</b> <b>synthesis</b> (ES, ES2, ES E, ES M, ES P, Retro Synth), [...] {{frequency modulation synthesis}} (EFM1), wavetable synthesis (ES2, Retro Synth), vocoding (EVOC 20 PolySynth), sampling (EXS24 mikII, Drum Kit Designer), and component modeling techniques (Ultrabeat, Vintage B3, Vintage Clav, and Vintage Electric Piano, Sculpture). As of version 10.2, Logic Pro X also includes Alchemy, a sample-manipulation synthesizer that was previously developed by Camel Audio. The software instruments are activated by MIDI {{information that can be}} inputed via a midi instrument or drawn into the midi editor.|$|E
2500|$|Initially some {{companies}} steered away from emulating the <b>subtractive</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{in the digital}} realm because {{it was difficult to}} model how a filter would respond to these complex signals. [...] By the early '90s some fairly good implementations were beginning to appear. [...] The Peavey DPM series also touted as the first keyboards that could import samples which were not 'sampling keyboards'. [...] They also were the first to use off the shelf DSP chips, which emulated the response of analog filters. This sample playback technology also spawned a vast number of inexpensive consumer units called [...] in electronics stores. [...] As the price of memory began to plummet every company was making keyboards of this type. Casio and Yamaha have led sales in these types of units which feature built in speaker systems, usually can run from batteries or power adapters, and have a library of samples with very limited editing if any. They often use cheap plastic strips of keys to keep cost down.|$|E
40|$|The Crying Wave is {{a twenty}} minute music {{composition}} for an amplified ensemble of fifteen instruments {{combined with a}} prerecorded electroacoustic audio component and live signal processing. The composition explores the use of fundamental electroacoustic music techniques such as additive, <b>subtractive,</b> and granular <b>synthesis</b> as models for the creation and manipulation of materials and structure in both the instrumental and electroacoustic aspects of the work. Two series of harmonies underlie the piece and serve as both harmonic and melodic resources. Procedures including additive/subtractive durations, palindrome and canon, the Fibonacci series, and antiphonal alternation of instrumental groups are used throughout the composition to provide structural coherence. The MIDI data processing software Max is employed to control a number of aspects of the work during performance, including playback of prerecorded electroacoustic audio segments on compact disc, changes of effects algorithms for digital signal processing modules, and the generation of a click track for synchronization.

In the first dimension nucleic acid molecules are separated based on strandness and length {{in the presence of}} 7 M urea. After the first-dimension electrophoresis all nucleic acid fragments are heat denatured in the gel. During the second-dimension electrophoresis all nucleic acid fragments are single-stranded and migrate according to length. 2 D-SDE takes about 90 min and requires only basic skills and equipment. We show that 2 D-SDE has many applications in analyzing complex nucleic acid samples including (1) estimation of renaturation efficiency and kinetics, (2) monitoring cDNA synthesis, (3) detection of nicked DNA fragments, and (4) estimation of quality and in vitro damage of nucleic acid samples. Results from 2 D-SDE should be useful to validate techniques such as complex polymerase chain reaction, <b>subtractive</b> hybridization, cDNA <b>synthesis,</b> cDNA normalization, and microarray analysis. 2 D-SDE could also be used, e. g., to characterize biological nucleic acid samples. Information obtained with 2 D-SDE cannot be readily obtained with other methods. 2 D-SDE can be used for preparative isolation of ssDNA fragments, dsDNA fragments, and RNA-DNA hybrids...|$|R
