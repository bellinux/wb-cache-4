25|$|Gordon's attack {{started at}} 4:15a.m. Lead parties of sharpshooters and {{engineers}} masquerading as deserting soldiers {{headed out to}} overwhelm Union pickets and to remove obstructions that would delay the infantry advance. They were followed by three groups of 100 men assigned to storm the Union works and stream back into the Union rear area. Brig. Gen. Napoleon B. McLaughlen rode to Fort Haskell, just {{to the south of}} Battery XII, which he found to be ready to defend itself. As he moved north, he ordered Battery XII to open fire on Battery XI and a reserve infantry regiment briefly re-captured Battery XI. Assuming that he had sealed the only breach in the line, McLaughlen rode into Fort Stedman and began giving orders to the men. He <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> they were Confederates and they realized he was a Union general, capturing him.|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of April 12, Norris didn't dare take the two ARVN {{soldiers}} who had faltered the night before. He was prepared to go alone when Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet volunteered to go with him. They worked their way slowly upriver until they came upon an abandoned, destroyed village. They found clothing and an abandoned sampan, which they used to disguise themselves as fishermen. They rowed quietly up river, {{but even in the}} pitch dark and dense fog they could see large numbers of North Vietnamese soldiers and tanks on the shoreline. Stopping to check his map at one point, Norris <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> two NVA soldiers were sitting about [...] away. Fortunately, they were asleep. Traveling upriver in the sampam, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves under the Cam Lo bridge. They had passed Hambleton’s position more than 30 minutes ago. Turning around, they worked their way south before putting ashore and began to search for Hambleton. They finally found him sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious and extremely weakened, having eaten only four small ears of corn in 12 days and having lost [...] since his plane was shot down. He weighed only [...] Sunrise was coming, and although Norris thought it best to wait until dark to return downriver, Hambleton needed to be evacuated immediately. Despite the risk, they hid Hambleton {{in the bottom of the}} sampan, covered him with bamboo, and started downriver.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1850–1851, while {{he was working on}} Opera and Drama, Wagner {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a comic opera based on a {{well-known}} folk-tale, Vor einem, der auszug, das Fürchten zu lernen (The Boy Who Set Out to Learn Fear), which he had come across in Grimms' Fairy Tales. [...] "Imagine my surprise," [...] he later wrote to his friend the violinist Theodor Uhlig, [...] "when I <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this youth was none other than young Siegfried!" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> his neck was oddly {{leathery}} and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert Russcol writes: [...] "Soon he was {{intrigued}} {{with the new}} sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another." [...] Ussachevsky said later: [...] "I <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the tape recorder could be treated {{as an instrument of}} sound transformation." [...] On Thursday, May 8, 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition, and Underwater Valse. In an interview, he stated: [...] "I presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in New York together with other compositions I had written for conventional instruments." ...|$|E

2500|$|Murakami {{began to}} write fiction when he was 29. [...] "Before that", he said, [...] "I didn't write anything. I {{was just one of}} those {{ordinary}} people. I was running a jazz club, and I didn't create anything at all." [...] He was inspired to write his first novel, Hear the Wind Sing (1979), while watching a baseball game. In 1978, Murakami was in Jingu Stadium watching a game between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp when Dave Hilton, an American, came to bat. According to an oft-repeated story, in the instant that Hilton hit a double, Murakami <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he could write a novel. He went home and began writing that night. Murakami worked on Hear the Wind Sing for ten months in very brief stretches after working days at the bar. He completed the novel and sent it to the only literary contest that would accept a work of that length, winning first prize.|$|E
2500|$|Java (November 27, 1966) – Two tube-like Muppets (which were {{designed}} by Frank Oz) dance to the Al Hirt song [...] "Java." [...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage {{just in time for the}} climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!).|$|E
2500|$|Between 1962 and 1964, Garcia {{sang and}} {{performed}} mainly bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. One {{of the bands}} Garcia performed with was the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, a bluegrass act. The group consisted of Jerry Garcia on guitar, banjo, vocals, and harmonica, Marshall Leicester on banjo, guitar, and vocals, and Dick Arnold on fiddle and vocals. Soon after this, Garcia, Weir, Ron [...] "Pigpen" [...] McKernan, and several of their friends formed a jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Around this time, the psychedelic LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: [...] "Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it {{for it to be}} shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved".|$|E

2500|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in big close-up, and said [...] "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!" [...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalist's description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance.... I for one <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the end of the silent drama is in sight".|$|E
2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time— maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it." ...|$|E
