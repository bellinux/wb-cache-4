50|$|On {{some larger}} TV screen sizes, the scanned lines were not fat {{enough to give}} 100% {{coverage}} of the CRT. The result was a lined picture with darkness between each horizontal scanned line, reducing picture brightness and contrast. Larger screen sets often used a <b>spot</b> <b>wobble</b> oscillator, that slightly elongated the scanning spot vertically at high frequency to avoid this line separation effect without reducing horizontal sharpness. <b>Spot</b> <b>wobble</b> was also utilised when making telerecordings of 405-line programmes.|$|E
60|$|I told Steve he was brutal {{with the}} animal, {{and we had}} some words—the first we’d ever had. He threw the whip down {{in the snow and}} walked away mad. I picked it up and went to it. That <b>Spot</b> trembled and <b>wobbled</b> and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the first bite of it he howled like a lost soul. Next he lay down in the snow. I started the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while I threw the whip into him. He rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four legs waving in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a sausage machine. Steve came back and laughed at me, and I apologized for what I’d said.|$|R
60|$|At any rate, Spot wouldn't work. We paid {{a hundred}} and ten dollars for him {{from the bottom of}} our sack, and he wouldn't work. He wouldn't even tighten the traces. Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all. Not an ounce on the traces. He just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly. Steve touched him with the whip. He yelped, but not an ounce. Steve touched him again, a bit harder, and he howled--the regular long wolf howl. Then Steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the tent. I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some words--the first we'd ever had.
