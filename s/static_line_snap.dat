50|$|Instructor-assisted {{deployment}} (IAD) is {{a parachute}} deployment program most adequately similar to <b>static</b> <b>line.</b> The main {{difference is that}} instead of being deployed by a <b>static</b> <b>line,</b> the student's jumpmaster (who is in the plane with them) deploys the student's parachute by throwing the pilot chute downward and clear of the door as the student exits.|$|R

5000|$|For {{training}} {{students in}} civilian operations, modifications to existing <b>static</b> <b>line</b> equipment {{may be made}} to simplify operations. One such modification is to attach the deployment bag to the parachute instead of the <b>static</b> <b>line,</b> which also requires some modification to allow the <b>static</b> <b>line</b> to detach, typically a Velcro fastener. This leaves much less material [...] "in the wind" [...] behind the plane after the jumper has left. This isn't a problem for larger cargo aircraft used in military jumping, but presents a major issue for smaller aircraft used in civilian operations. This modification also results in a somewhat slower opening, which softens the opening shock {{at the cost of}} altitude, a minor concern for jumpers exiting at 2800 ft.|$|R

5000|$|The T-10 Parachute is {{a series}} of static line-deployed parachutes used by the United States armed forces for combat mass-assault {{airborne}} operations and training. The T-10 parachute was introduced in the early 1950s. In 1976, the B model introduced the anti-inversion net; in 1986, the C model was introduced, which changed the pocket band free length from 4" [...] to 7Â½". The T-10D, adopted in 2000, includes the detachable pack tray, which in itself includes the 15' universal <b>static</b> <b>line</b> and 5' extension <b>static</b> <b>line.</b> The T-10D is currently being replaced by the T-11 parachute system. In 2006, all T-10C parachutes were revised by adding one <b>static</b> <b>line</b> stow bar to each side of the pack tray; the material for the T-10C was also changed to the Army's Foliage Green #504.|$|R

50|$|A <b>static</b> <b>line</b> is a cord {{attached}} {{at one end}} to {{the aircraft}} and at the other end {{to the top of the}} jumper's 'D-Bag' (Deployment Bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the <b>static</b> <b>line</b> to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The <b>static</b> <b>line</b> and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of <b>static</b> <b>line</b> progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism.|$|R
