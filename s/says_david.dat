25|$|The void which {{cuts through}} the entire height of the building, and this was {{intentionally}} done by the architect to visually connect {{the upper and lower}} spaces. This longitudinal void opens to a rooftop skylight, bringing in natural daylight into the atrium below. The typical dependence of artificial lighting for a building of this size would typically account for more than 13% of its electricity use. However, with the installation of this void, a great portion of that cost is reduced. This spatial device was intended as a sustainable element of the design, as seen in many of Foster’s projects, it is an effective solution to reducing electricity consumption which is vital to a structure of this scale. The most important aspect that this vertical void contributes to the building is that is creates a distinctive social space for its users. Norman Foster has been experimenting and studying with the reconfiguration of spaces and the natural lighting conditions to redefine institutions. This void creates a vast, open, daylight space for the students to gather and relax in between classes. Also, the 23 research laboratories and teaching laboratories are intentionally planned and organized in such a manner where they are fully integrated into other programs- service spaces for faculty members, students and administrators. These programs are connected by bridges which cross the void at the upper floors. As for the pods which are suspended {{in the middle of the}} atrium, these mysterious pods were intentionally designed to give the illusion of defying gravity due to their size and weight. One architectural detail that most be noted, the bottom of the glass-clad cube of the larger volume was specifically designed to line up with the cornices of its adjacent historic buildings. Furthermore, the bottom of the new building will be transparent so that the older buildings will be visible through the lobby, <b>says</b> <b>David</b> Nelson of Foster and Partners.|$|E

2500|$|One {{astronomer}} has speculated {{the warming}} {{may be a}} result of eruptive activity, but it is more likely Pluto's temperature is heavily influenced by its elliptical orbit.

[...] "This warming trend on Pluto could easily last for another 13 years," [...] <b>says</b> <b>David</b> J. Tholen. It has also been suggested that a darkening of surface ice may also be the cause, but additional data and modeling is needed.

[...] Freeman's research was thorough, and the story is told from Washington's own viewpoint. Freeman wrote, [...] "the great big thing stamped across that man is character." [...] By character, <b>says</b> <b>David</b> Hackett Fischer [...] "Freeman meant integrity, self-discipline, courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance, decency, and respect for others."

David Hackett Fischer's long, intense, microscopic study of the December 1775 campaign Washington's Crossing (2004) likewise won a Pulitzer Prize in 2005.

2500|$|In mid-1436 Stafford, {{accompanied}} by Gloucester, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Earls of Huntingdon, [...] Warwick, Devon, and Ormond, returned to France again with {{an army of}} nearly 8,000 men. Although the expedition's purpose was to end the siege of Calais, {{by the time the}} English arrived, the French besiegers had withdrawn, [...] leaving behind a quantity of cannon for the English to seize. Peace talks in France occupied Stafford throughout 1439. In 1442 he was appointed Captain of Calais and of the tower of Risbanke, and was indented to serve for the next decade. Before he arrived in Calais – in September 1442 – the garrison had revolted, seizing the Staple's wool in lieu of their unpaid wages. Stafford received a pledge from the council that if such a situation arose again during his tenure, he would not be held responsible. In light of the secrecy that cloaked Stafford's appointment in 1442, <b>says</b> <b>David</b> Grummitt, it is even possible that the revolt had actually been staged by his servants to ensure that Stafford [...] "had entry on favourable terms" [...] to Calais. Stafford had, after all, emphasised the need to restore order there in his original application for the position. He also received permission to export gold and jewels (up to £5,000-worth every time he returned there) for his use in France, even though the export of bullion was illegal at the time. He appears to have served the full term of his appointment as Calais captain, as he left office in 1451.|$|E

'The hypocrite,' says Job, 'shall not come before him.' 'The upright,' <b>says</b> <b>David,</b> 'shall not dwell in thy presence' (Job 13:16; Psa 140:13).

Hence the afflicted is called a fool, because his folly brings his affliction upon him. 'Fools,' <b>says</b> <b>David,</b> 'because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted' (Psa 107:17).

Well, Nathan is sent to preach a preaching to him, and that in common, and that in special: in common, by a parable; in special, by a particular application of it to him. While Nathan only preached in common, or in general, David was fish-whole,[3] and stood as right in his own eyes {{as if he had been}} as innocent and as harmless as any man alive. But God had a love for David; and therefore commands his servant Nathan to go home, not only to David's ears, but to David's conscience. Well, David now must fall. Says Nathan, 'Thou art the man'; <b>says</b> <b>David,</b> 'I have sinned,' and then his heart was broken, and his spirit made contrite; as this psalm and our text doth show (2 Sam 12:1-13).|$|E
60|$|He then is {{the poor}} man, that knows his spiritual want, and also knows he cannot supply or help himself.

I have sacrifices, <b>says</b> <b>David,</b> but thou dosts not desire them, therefore my poverty remains (Psa 51:16). Lead is not gold, lead is not current money with the merchants. There is none has spiritual gold to sell but Christ (Rev 3:18). What can a man do to procure Christ, or procure faith, or love? Yea, had he never {{so much of his}} own carnal excellencies, no, not one penny of it will go for pay in that market where grace is to be hand.
