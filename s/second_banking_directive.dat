In April 1992, the European Commission proposed a directive on deposit protection schemes that used a modified home-country approach for branches of banks from other member states and involved a limited amount of harmonisation.

When the new branch organization is implemented, EU directives specify that the home country is responsible for supervision, regulation as well as deposit insurance. Supervisors in all involved countries are challenged by this prospect and they are negotiating to obtain an acceptable division of responsibilities. We argue that the Nordea case offers an opportunity to implement the EU's vision and to develop institutional foundations for substantial market discipline in banking.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the U.

This paper analyzes the cost and profit efficiency of European financial conglomerates and universal banks. We find that conglomerates are more revenue efficient than their specialized competitors and {{that the degree of}} both cost and profit efficiency is higher in universal banks than in non-universal banks. These results indicate that the current trend towards further de-specialization may lead to a more efficient banking system. An investigation of the equity betas under varying business cycle conditions supports the hypothesis of superior monitoring capabilities on the part of universal banks.

40|$|From the Introduction]. Economic {{deregulation}} in many industrialised countries {{during the}} 1980 s, the liberalisation of capital movements within the European Union (EU) in 1990, {{and the establishment}} of the single market for financial services have radically transformed the regulatory framework of European financial markets.

Its implementation started in 1993 with the application of the <b>second</b> <b>banking</b> <b>directive.</b> 1 In this context, monetary union is often seen as the accomplishment of the process of European financial integration. The elimination of exchange risk should indeed boost cross-border competition. The nature and speed of integration differ between wholesale and retail financial markets.

40|$|Supervisor: F. SnyderDefence date: 6 March 1992 First made {{available}} online on 10 September 2013. This research is an interdisciplinary {{approach to the}} EEC banking harmonization process. The methodology employed consists in focusing the subject from the legal, economic and political Science perspectives. Therefore, the underlying purpose of the research is to study the legal outcomes within their context. The research is subdivided in several parts. The first part is a legal approach to both the first and <b>second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directives</b> as the cornerstones of the EEC banking harmonization process. The detailed analysis of both Directives from an EEC legal perspective is a condition precedent for the understanding of how is being shaped the Community Financial Policy. The Second Part is a political science approach {{to the role of}} interest within the EEC decision making process. More specifically, it is an attempt to show how banks can influence legislators for the achievement of their objectives. An additional study to this second part, is constituted by the analysis of the Community policies in consumer protection. This sector provides us with comparative information for an estimation of the importance of "interest” within the shaping of regulatory policies within the EEC. A socioeconomic approach to credit institutions strategies 1 for the controlling of financial markets is the subject of the third part. Through the study of the United States current "deregulatory" trends, we show the interrelationship between the world financial markets. A second stage of this part connects the European context with the other representative world financial markets. Thus, similar behaviours can be remarked, which leads the author to the conclusion that neither national governments, nor the European Institutions are currently capable to regulate financial markets without a previous “consensus" with the financial institutions. The fourth part of the research consists in a critical approach to the institutional behaviour of the Community as regards policy-making for the achievement of an integrated financial market by 1992. This analysis shows that credit institutions, whose profits are greatly affected by public policy, have an extraordinary capacity to innovate and adapt, notably as a way of lawfully avoiding the effects of "public Controls”. Each of the four parts of the research used the same methodology. First, there is an introduction to establish the guidelines of the research approach to the subject. Secondly, there is a detailed analysis of the main issues constituting the field of the study. Thirdly, we draw some conclusions from the research...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{countries}} have experienced significant deregulation affecting the banking industry, a process culminated in 1993 with {{the implementation of}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> Coordination <b>Directive.</b> Prior to 1993, cross-border expansions were heavily constrained. Under the current regime, in contrast, banks from EU countries are allowed to branch freely into other EU countries. By removing substantial barriers to entry, the new legislation aimed at generating significant improvements in the competitive conditions of financial markets. However, concurrently to the process of deregulation, European banking industries have also experienced a significant process of consolidation and increase in market concentration. Exploiting such significant innovations affecting the banking industries of EU countries, this paper explores the effect of changes in banking market structure on the market structure of non-financial industries. It asks whether bank competition promotes the formation of industries constituted by a few, large firms, or rather, whether it facilitates the continuous entry of new firms, thus maintaining unconcentrated market structures across industries. Theoretical arguments could be made to support either hypothetical scenario. Empirical evidence is derived from a panel of manufacturing industries in 29 OECD countries, both EU and non-EU members, adopting a methodology that allows controlling for other determinants of industry market structure common across industries, across countries or related to time passing. The evidence suggests that the overall process of enhanced competition in EU banking markets has lead to less concentrated markets in nonfinancial sectors...|$|R

40|$|On {{the first}} of January 1993, the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directive</b> (1989) of the European Union {{and a number of}} the other EU Directives (1) related to the {{financial}} service industry were implemented.

The single passport and mutual recognition have cleared the road for cross-border banking, while the introduction of the single currency on {{the first of}} January 1999 took away one of the last obstacles for a competitive and integrated banking market. The general belief among bankers and academics is that competition has significantly increased in this changing European banking environment. Indeed, the numerous cases of recent mergers and acquisitions in the financial world would indicate that bankers and insurers are trying to reshape their businesses into more profitable and lean (cost efficient) institutions in order to face national and global competitive pressures. Traditional income streams such as interest margins have dried up, whereas new sources of revenues such as brokerage services, investment banking products, risk management and portfolio management have become more and more important. Besides major changes in the regulatory environment, the banking industry will be further modernised by the implementation of new computer technologies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} cost {{efficiency}} of 1974 credit institutions across 15 European countries over the five-year period following {{the implementation of}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directive</b> in 1993. The Recursive Thick Frontier Approach is employed to estimate a Augmented Cobb-Douglas cost frontier that allows banks of different types, in different periods, and belonging to different size categories, to operate at different costs per unit of assets. As size economies are exhausted at a balance sheet total of EUR 600 million, we do not find major economic gains from economies of scale for the overall European banking industry. However, the saving bank sector may reduce average costs with roughly 6 % by choosing an optimal size for its institutions. No impact of technological progress on the average costs of the full sample of X-efficient banks could be detected but managerial efficient saving banks reduced average costs with 9 % during our sample period. The most important reason for inefficiencies in the European banking is managerial inability to control costs. Although in some countries such as the UK and The Netherlands cost reductions were rapidly achieved, the average level of X-inefficiency of European banks still exceeded 16 % in 1997.

This thesis deals with mergers and acquisitions that were undertaken by the largest European banks between 1985 and 1992. On the basis of an empirical survey among executives from 61 banks and a survey of financial news sources, the study finds that the number of merger events increased significantly in 1988 and peaked in 1989. The same sources indicate that on the macro level the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directive</b> of 1988, which prescribed the integration of Europe's financial markets by the end of 1992, was the main reason for the merger trend. On the level of the individual firm, the thesis finds that significantly often, European banks in the past merged because of the following five reasons: (1) to achieve economies of scale, (2) to diversify into new geographic markets, (3) to achieve a sufficient size, (4) to reduce overlaps, or (5) to implement a change of strategy. A survey of the academic literature in the third part of this thesis tries to evaluate some of those motivations. Regarding economies of scale and efficient bank size, {{there seems to be no}} consensus among academics. While existence of economies of scale for large banks was mostlythe negated in earlier studies, several recent articles suggest a reevaluation of that opinion. The thesis concludes with an analysis of some factors that are commonly believed to be success factors in bank mergers. Several sources suggest that management skills are a crucial factor which can make the difference between the success or failure of a merger...|$|E

40|$|The <b>second</b> European <b>banking</b> <b>directive</b> of 1989 allows {{national}} banking {{markets to}} become more concentrated over the last decennia and allows banks {{to do more than}} just lending. These conditions form the perfect basis to investigate the effect of bank characteristics on firms' external financing and growth. Additionally, we assess the impact of the current financial crisis. The aim of the first two chapters is to examine the relationship between more concentrated banking markets and external finance behavior of firms. The first paper examines firm capital structure. Results show that more concentrated banking markets are associated with less external capital which suggest that banks use their market power. In the second paper we investigate loan characteristics such as size, maturity and spread of syndicated loans. In the syndicated loan market, more concentrated banking markets lead to lower loan spreads. However, during the financial crisis we find that more concentrated banking markets cause an increase in loan spreads which aggravates the effect of the financial crisis. In the third chapter, we examine the relationship between banks as shareholder and the performance of firms in which banks own shares. Banks are expected to be more able to control management, because they can lend to firms as well as being a shareholder. Nevertheless, we find bank ownership to reduce firm value. This result contrasts sharply with the hypothesis that banks are good monitors. It suggests that banks should focus on their core activities. Finally, we investigate the impact of bank regulation on the liquidity provisioning of banks to firms. Liquidity provisioning is one of the primary reasons for banks to exist. Moreover, the banking sector is one of the most regulated industries in the world, where bank capital plays a prominent role. Our results show that stronger supervision of bank capital results in lower liquidity provisioning. Yet, during the financial crisis stronger supervision of bank capital stimulates liquidity provisioning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} examine whether or not wealth effects {{and changes in the}} {{systematic}} risk associated with the return structure of the Greek commercial chartered banks, investment firms and insurance companies resulted from the passage of the European Union <b>Banking</b> <b>Directives</b> over the period 1988 - 1997. Design/methodology/approach – Using monthly stock returns from the DataStream database for the period January 1988 to December 1997, the separate effects of each of the EU <b>Banking</b> <b>Directives</b> on Greek commercial chartered banks, investment firms and insurance companies are tested. The “seemingly unrelated regression” methodology is utilized to test three portfolios consisting of an equally weighted banking, investment and insurance index made up of major Greek banks, investment firms and insurance companies respectively. The Greek Market Index serves as a proxy for the market portfolio. All the aforementioned indices were converted to returns using the log difference method. Findings – Empirical results indicate that the systematic risk dramatically increased for Greek insurance and investment firms and moderately increased for Greek commercial chartered banks through the tabling of the Free Capital Movement Directive in the Greek Parliament. After controlling for systematic risk, the results suggest that the passage of the Free Capital Movement Directive did not create wealth effects for the shareholders of commercial chartered banks, investment firms and insurance companies. Conversely, the results demonstrate that the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking,</b> Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives produced no wealth effects for the investment firms and insurance companies, but not for commercial chartered banks' shareholders. The whole wealth effect on the Greek financial sector was neutral. Originality/value – This article will be of value to academics, bankers, bank regulators, practitioners, and economic policy makers who are interested in the regulatory evolution of the EU banking industry. <b>Banking,</b> European <b>directives,</b> Financial risk, Greece, Risk management, Wealth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} Schure and Wagenvoort (1999) study, which {{considers}} {{economies of scale}} and efficiency in European banking, {{in a number of}} directions. Firstly, we introduce what we believe to be important improvements to estimating efficiency. Secondly, we examine more closely the characteristics of the banks on the cost frontier and draw comparisons between the characteristics of these banks and those of the relatively inefficient banks in our sample. In contrast with the results of Schure and Wagenvoort (1999), we find that both X-efficient savings banks and Xefficient commercial banks have cut their average cost, independent of input price movements or changes in the output mix, by about 5 percent each year during the five-year period following the implementation of the <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directive</b> of the European Union on the first of January 1993. In other words, we observe structural shifts in the cost frontier, possibly due to technological progress. X-inefficient banks became only slightly more inefficient than their efficient counterparts. Therefore, these banks also experienced substantial reductions in average cost. However, these reductions are mainly explained by lower interest expenditures because of lower real interest rates rather than structural changes. Additionally to the results of Schure and Wagenvoort (1999), an examination of the output mix of efficient and inefficient banks reveals that the efficient banks {{are likely to be more}} involved in more "commercial" (or fee-based) activities since their ratio of commission revenue to total operating income is higher. The profitability of savings banks appears strongly determined by their cost efficiency which supports the efficient structure hypothesis. The average profitability of efficient commercial banks seems mainly driven by other factors, such as possibly output prices, rather than cost considerations.

40|$|From the Introduction] This study {{provides}} new {{evidence on the}} emergence of a single eurozone retail banking market with particular reference to consumer credit. Given the heterogeneous nature of consumer credit products in the eurozone, the authors reject the earlier proposition of the Cecchini study, which equates banking market integration with identical interest rates throughout the eurozone. The present study advocates the use of the co-integration methodology, which allows us to investigate integration in the presence of country-specific credit rates. The empirical results indicate only very limited evidence of an integrated retail banking market prior to 1 January 1999, pointing to the limited effectiveness of the single market cum <b>Second</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Directive</b> in particular in integrating consumer credit markets. The relationship of national lending markets with the remaining eurozone lending markets, however, exhibits strong signs of structural changes that have come along with the introduction of the single currency. Regarding this period under monetary union, the results provide a first picture of an emerging uniform eurozone banking market. This tendency is more pronounced for the corporate lending market, while consumer lending markets are still more fragmented. The study identifies three possible driving forces of this integration process: cross-border borrowing and lending (arbitrage), a competitive national and international retail banking environment, and a smooth and uniform passthrough of interest rate changes onto lending rates. While the extent of cross-border retail banking is still very limited and interest rate pass-through is working most efficiently and uniformly in the more competitive corporate lending market, the authors conclude that the single currency has the potential to “complete” the single market in a very special sense. It is not so much cross-border arbitrage that has so far produced the “statistical signs” of an uniform retail banking market, but a smooth and uniform passthrough of interest rate changes induced by the single monetary policy. The lack of evidence of integration in consumer credit so far therefore also points to the relevance of competition policy for creating a uniform consumer credit market in the eurozone...|$|E
