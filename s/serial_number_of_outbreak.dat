30|$|Yet another methodological {{advantage}} is {{the measurement of}} the burden of disease. Our study tested a suppressive, or long term treatment, yet, unlike most clinical studies of ACV, VACV, and FCV, it measured the effect on the duration <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> not the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> If we define the burden of genital herpes as the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days with <b>outbreaks,</b> then the burden of genital herpes equals the average duration <b>of</b> an <b>outbreak</b> times the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> Since we could not find clinical studies of suppressive treatments that measured the effect on duration <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> and clinical studies of episodic treatments that measured the effect on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> it seems that no previous studies measured the effect of ACV, VACV, and FCV on the burden of the disease. Our paper reports the effect of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the duration <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> Polansky et al. [24] reports the effect of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> By multiplying the results in both papers, one can calculate, for the first time, the effect of a treatment on the burden of genital herpes.|$|R
