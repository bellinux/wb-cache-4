40|$|Section 6. 1 Diagnostic {{parameters}} and Table 2 – Diagnostic page codes for enclosure <b>service</b> <b>devices</b> of the SES specification define page codes 01 h– 0 Fh as reserved for SES pages. In addition, page codes 80 h–FFh {{are defined as}} vendor-specific pages for the non-enclosure <b>services</b> <b>devices</b> supporting access to an enclosure services process. This means that vendorspecific pages cannot be defined for the enclosure <b>services</b> <b>device.</b> While the String In and String Out pages do provide a form of vendor specific SES page, mutual exclusion between multiple initiators becomes a problem. A String Out page needs to be defined to select the vendor-specific information to be presented in the String In page; this is a two step process that provides the opportunity for one application client to interfere with another application client. Dedicated vendor-specific pages for the SES device will work much better. Suggested Changes Dedicate sixteen page codes from 10 h– 1 Fh for use by enclosure <b>services</b> <b>devices</b> as vendorspecific. Also, move all the SES-specific page names to an annex in SPC- 3 rather than list them in section 8. SES defines its page ranges.

The frequency band is HF, 26.9650 MHz to 27.4050 MHz (40 channels), power output is 4 watts for AM and FM and 12 watts PEP for SSB.

40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} network comprises {{a variety}} of distributed <b>service</b> <b>devices.</b> Today Web <b>services</b> technology enables the heterogeneous devices to provide their own services and {{interact with each other}} via well-defined Internet protocol. Nevertheless, <b>service</b> <b>devices</b> in ubiquitous environments require more event-driven, autonomous interaction beyond rather passive service-oriented architecture of the present time. This paper presents an ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rule description language in an attempt to support capability for autonomous interactions among service-oriented devices in ubiquitous computing network. Specifically, the proposed WS-ECA is an XML-based ECA rule description language for web service-enabled devices. The rules are embedded in distributed devices which invoke appropriate services in the network if the rules are triggered by some internal or external events. The presented ECA-based device coordination approach is expected to facilitate seamless inter-operation among the web service-enabled devices in the emerging ubiquitous computing environment...|$|R

50|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the volume of available <b>service,</b> <b>device</b> and sensor data has led to new, real-time market segments which augment the traditional monitoring, business intelligence and data warehousing domains. The Internet of Things promises to bring {{hundreds of billions of}} connected devices to the Internet, all streaming out data that need to be processed in aggregate in real-time in order to power smart services that can react and respond to their environment through these sensors. Stored data analytics systems where one continually updates the data store with newly arriving data and re-traverse the stored data in order to perform analysis on the data do not scale up to the very large volumes of data emitted in the Internet of Things. They are not designed for issuing queries or analyses for each of millions of records per second. This is where technologies like SQLstream come in, that process the data incrementally and continually, without first storing the data. Such an approach is called Stream Processing. All of this information was released in public press releases.|$|E
