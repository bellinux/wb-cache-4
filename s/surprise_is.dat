25|$|This {{is because}} – under ergodic {{assumptions}} – the long-term average of <b>surprise</b> <b>is</b> entropy. This bound resists a natural tendency to disorder – {{of the sort}} associated with the second law of thermodynamics and the fluctuation theorem.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} for me {{to give you an idea}} of the surprise and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail.

25|$|However, {{free energy}} {{is also an}} upper bound on the self-information (or surprise) of outcomes, where the {{long-term}} average of <b>surprise</b> <b>is</b> entropy.

25|$|<b>Surprise</b> <b>is</b> a big {{element in}} bowling, and bowlers will often shun common {{tactical}} approaches {{in the hope}} of simply confusing the batsman into playing the wrong shot. For example, bowling a yorker at a new batsman who will likely be expecting bouncers or at least standard line and length balls has been the cause of many batsmen losing their wicket first ball.|$|E

25|$|In Mortal Kombat X, {{prior to}} his comic book prequel events, {{as well as his}} {{encounters}} with Kenshi to assist in his revival as a human and restore the Shirai Ryu as the clan's Grandmaster 25 years ago, Scorpion still served Quan Chi. He was first seen in Johnny Cage's chapter of the game's story, allied with a now fleshed revenant Sub-Zero, killing most of the Special Force soldiers, except the high rank leaders Johnny, Sonya and Kenshi, who manage to survive their assassination attempts thanks to Johnny's effort on defeating him and Sub-Zero. In story mode it is revealed that Scorpion's soul was restored to the living (along with Sub-Zero and Jax) by Raiden, who combined Quan Chi's magic with his own. Now Hanzo Hasashi once again, he reforms the Shirai Ryu clan and trains Kenshi's son, Takeda, in his fighting style. Hanzo made amends with Sub-Zero as Sub-Zero revealed that Quan Chi was responsible for the murder of Hanzo's family and clan. When the Special Forces capture Quan Chi, Hanzo and the Shirai Ryu subdue them, with Hanzo singlehandedly defeating Johnny Cage and Kenshi. Fueled by revenge, he was oblivious to Quan Chi's true plan, and ignored the Special Forces' hopes to return the other revenants to life. Freeing Quan Chi from imprisonment, Hanzo challenged Quan Chi to a final battle, with Hanzo emerging victorious. Concurrently, D'Vorah appeared after having betrayed Kotal Kahn and ended the Outworld Civil War, taking Shinnok's amulet from the now-dead Mileena. As Hanzo prepared to decapitate Quan Chi, D'Vorah throws the amulet to Quan Chi, who recites a spell to release Shinnok from the amulet. Immediately after the spell's conclusion, Quan Chi is killed, avenging Hanzo's family. However, Shinnok is returned to the physical world instantly, and in Scorpion's <b>surprise,</b> <b>is</b> immediately blasted away and knocked out by Shinnok. He is not seen again {{for the remainder of the}} story, leaving his fate, as well as many other characters, unknown.|$|E
