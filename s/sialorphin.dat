40|$|<b>Sialorphin</b> is an exocrine and {{endocrine}} signaling mediator, {{which has}} been identified by a genomic approach. It is synthesized predominantly in the submandibular gland and prostate of adult rats in response to androgen steroids and is released locally and systemically in response to stress. We now demonstrate that the cell surface molecule to which <b>sialorphin</b> binds in vivo in the rat kidney is the membrane-anchored neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin; NEP, EC 3. 4. 24. 11). NEP {{plays an important role}} in nervous and peripheral tissues, as it turns off several peptide-signaling events at the cell surface. We show that <b>sialorphin</b> prevents spinal and renal NEP from breaking down its two physiologically relevant substrates, substance P and Met-enkephalin in vitro. <b>Sialorphin</b> inhibited the breakdown of substance P with an IC 50 of 0. 4 – 1 μM and behaved as a competitive inhibitor. In vivo, i. v. <b>sialorphin</b> elicited potent antinociceptive responses in two behavioral rat models of injury-induced acute and tonic pain, the pin-pain test and formalin test. The analgesia induced by 100 – 200 μg/kg doses of <b>sialorphin</b> required the activation of μ- and δ-opioid receptors, consistent with the involvement of endogenous opioid receptors in enkephalinergic transmission. We conclude that <b>sialorphin</b> protects endogenous enkephalins released after nociceptive stimuli by inhibiting NEP in vivo. <b>Sialorphin</b> is a natural systemically active regulator of NEP activity. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that it is a physiological modulator of pain perception after injury and might be the progenitor of a new class of therapeutic molecules...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>sialorphin</b> (Gln-His-Asn-Pro-Arg) and its analog (Glp-His-Asn-Pro-Arg) were {{analyzed}} {{in terms of}} metal binding ability. Both peptides were synthesized using the solid-phase method. The application of number analytical methods: potentiometry, spectroscopy (UV-Vis, CD, NMR) and mass spectrometry allowed for a detailed characterization of the coordination abilities of presented peptides. The analysis of the obtained results has shown that both peptides are able to form a series of complexes. However due {{to the presence of}} free N-terminal amino group the <b>sialorphin</b> is more effective in metal ion binding. Nevertheless, in basic conditions both peptides involve the amide nitrogen belonging to the side chain of Asn 3 moiety and form 4 N complex with square planar structure. This unusual ability has been confirmed by the results obtained from the NMR studies...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian zinc ectopeptidases play {{important}} roles in turning off neural and hormonal peptide signals at the cell surface, notably those processing sensory information. We report here {{the discovery of a}} previously uncharacterized physiological inhibitor of enkephalin-inactivating zinc ectopeptidases in humans, which we have named Opiorphin. It is a QRFSR peptide that inhibits two enkephalin-catabolizing ectoenzymes, human neutral ecto-endopeptidase, hNEP (EC 3. 4. 24. 11), and human ecto-aminopeptidase, hAP-N (EC 3. 4. 11. 2). Opiorphin displays potent analgesic activity in chemical and mechanical pain models by activating endogenous opioid-dependent transmission. Its function is closely related to the rat <b>sialorphin</b> peptide, which is an inhibitor of pain perception and acts by potentiating endogenous μ- and δ-opioid receptor-dependent enkephalinergic pathways. Here we demonstrate the functional specificity in vivo of human Opiorphin. The pain-suppressive potency of Opiorphin is as effective as morphine in the behavioral rat model of acute mechanical pain, the pin-pain test. Thus, our discovery of Opiorphin is extremely exciting from a physiological point of view in the context of endogenous opioidergic pathways, notably in modulating mood-related states and pain sensation. Furthermore, because of its in vivo properties, Opiorphin may have therapeutic implications...|$|E
