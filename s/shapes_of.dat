5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> bright light are similar to the irregular light <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E

It has one of its axes of symmetry parallel to the coordinate axes on a half-integer line. Its width, approximately 1.545, is the root of a degree-6 polynomial with integer coefficients.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud. The sizes and <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> fall streaks {{are determined by the}} wind shear.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry.

5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E
