NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the <b>share</b> <b>value.</b> In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{field of}} CSR has {{developed}} from charity into an integration of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> {{into the business}} model. In developing countries there are enormous needs for better housing. This therefore could be an area where companies {{might be able to}} create <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> It is however unclear how <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> would look like in the building supply network and to what extent this already exists. Purpose: The purpose is to detect future areas of research by identifying opportunities for <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> in the building material supply chain. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is viewed as a possible example of synergy for quality and sustainability research and development. Methodology: A literature review is carried out searching for “shared value” and “Porter”. The findings are combined with stakeholder theory, the process view and customer focus. Additionally the sustainability reports of the 15 largest cement and building material companies in the world were studied with the purpose of identifying examples of the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> concept. Working with <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is visualised with an example using the process of building material supply in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Findings: Findings indicate that the concept of <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is widely spread, but that its application in the cement and building material supply industry still is limited. The concept seems to have a good potential in identifying and creating value for both business and other stakeholders. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> can be seen as enlarged business focus from shareholders to stakeholders. Practical implications: The results provide both ideas for further research and indicate how companies within the building material network could work with <b>shared</b> <b>value.</b> Originality/value: The paper more clearly links <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> to stakeholder focus...|$|R

25|$|As eco-socialists {{disagree}} with the elite theories of capitalism, which tend to label a specific class or social group as conspirators who construct a system that satisfies their greed and personal desires, Kovel suggests that the capitalist system itself is self-perpetuating, fuelled by extra-human or impersonal forces. He uses the Bhopal Union-Carbide industrial disaster as an example. Many anti-corporation observers would blame the avarice of those {{at the top of}} many multi-national corporations. Conversely, Kovel traces systemic impulses. Union Carbide were experiencing a decrease in sales that led to falling profits, which, due to stock market conditions, translated into a drop in share values. The depreciation of <b>share</b> <b>value</b> made many shareholders sell their stock, weakening the company and leading to cost-cutting measures that eroded the safety procedures and mechanisms at the Bhopal site. Though this did not, in Kovel's mind, make Bhopal inevitable, it illustrates the effect market forces can have on increasing the likelihood of ecological and social problems.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1890s Oslo had three private tram companies, of which two, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, {{operated}} each their network of street trams.

The two dominant parties too each their stand: the Conservative Party wished to retain the private operations, while the Liberal Party supported a municipalization of the operations. The issue was split: Oslo Municipality taking over the existing two companies and establishing a new company to operate new lines. The municipality had in 1896 been offered to purchase KSS for its nominal <b>share</b> <b>value</b> plus interest in a move initiated by the tram company itself. Its main concern was its concession would expire in 1905 and that the municipality would then have the right expropriate it.

30|$|Unlike CSR, which assume {{businesses}} to consider social responsibility as supplementary, the <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> approach assumes that social responsibility {{is the center}} of every business performance. <b>Shared</b> <b>value</b> is not about personal values, nor about “sharing” the value already created by firms as is assumed by CSR. Instead, <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> is about expanding the total pool of economic and social value (Porter and Kramer, 2011).

2500|$|While {{derivative}} claims mean suing in the company's name, {{a minority}} shareholder can sue {{in her own}} name in four ways. The first is to claim a [...] "personal right" [...] under the constitution or the general law is breached. If a shareholder brings a personal action to vindicate a personal right (such {{as the right to}} not be misled by company circulars) the principle against double recovery dictates that one cannot sue for damages if the loss an individual shareholder suffers is merely the same as will be reflected in the reduction of the <b>share</b> <b>value.</b> For losses reflective of the company's, only a derivative claim may be brought. The second is to show that a company's articles were amended in an objectively unjustifiably and directly discriminatory fashion. This residual protection for minorities was developed by the Court of Appeal in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd, where Sir Nathaniel Lindley MR held that shareholders may amend a constitution by the required majority so long as it is [...] "bona fide {{for the benefit of the}} company as a whole." [...] This constraint is not heavy, as it can mean that a constitutional amendment, while applying in a formally equal way to all shareholders, has a negative and disparate impact on only one shareholder. This was so in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd, where the articles were changed to remove all shareholders' pre-emption rights, but only one shareholder (the claimant, Mr Greenhalgh, who lost) was interested in preventing share sales to outside parties. This slim set of protections for minority shareholders was, until 1985, complemented only by a third, and drastic right of a shareholder, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(g), to show it is [...] "just and equitable" [...] for a company to be liquidated. In Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd, Lord Wilberforce held that a court would use its discretion to wind up a company if three criteria were fulfilled: that the company was a small [...] "quasi-partnership" [...] founded on mutual confidence of the corporators, that shareholders participate in the business, and there are restrictions in the constitution on free transfer of shares. Given these features, it may be just and equitable to wind up a company if the court sees an agreement just short of a contract, or some other [...] "equitable consideration", that one party has not fulfilled. So where Mr Ebrahmi, a minority shareholder, had been removed from the board, and the other two directors paid all company profits out as director salaries, rather than dividends to exclude him, the House of Lords regarded it as equitable to liquidate the company and distribute his share of the sale proceeds to Mr Ebrahimi.|$|E

This was {{recognised in the}} United Kingdom's National Ecosystem Assessment, which noted that appreciation of the full value of ecosystem services requires recognition of <b>values</b> that are <b>shared.</b> By operationalising the <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> concept, {{it is argued that}} the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being can be represented more holistically. This paper considers current understanding of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> and develops a new metanarrative of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> beyond the aggregated utilities of individuals. This metanarrative seeks to conceptualise how values can be held both individually and communally, and what this means for identifying their scale and means of enumeration. The paper poses a new reading of the idea of <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> that reconciles the elicitation of pre-formed individual values with the formation and expression of <b>shared</b> social <b>values.</b> The implication is that <b>shared</b> <b>values</b> need to be conceived as normative constructs that are derived through social processes of value formation and expression. <b>Shared</b> <b>values</b> thus do not necessarily exist a priori; they can be deliberated through formal and informal processes through which individuals can separate their own preferences from a broader metanarrative about what values ought to be shared...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue in}} this thesis {{that the concept of}} <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> {{creation}} introduced by Porter and Kramer (2011) contain weaknesses when it comes to providing guidance for how industries can achieve <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation. An analytical framework which adapts the concept into an industry context is therefore developed {{in this thesis}}, where four aspects, namely innovation, long-term orientation, cooperation and stakeholder trust, are found to be crucial. Furthermore, the authorities are argued to have a particularly important role in facilitating <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in industries through the implementation of regulatory frameworks. The analytical framework is furthermore applied to the Norwegian aquaculture industry in order to investigate how the industry can become more corporate sustainable. The Norwegian aquaculture industry is currently experiencing severe sustainability challenges that need to be overcome if the industry is to realize growth, in which <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation emerges as an important measure. Two research questions associated with how <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation can be realized in the Norwegian aquaculture industry are answered in the thesis. The first research question identifies the current barriers to <b>shared</b> <b>value</b> creation in the industry, while the second research question determines how governmental policies can help the industry to overcome these barriers. The research questions are answered through a qualitative case study of the development licenses, in which 12 semi-structured interviews with different industry stakeholders are conducted. Several barriers are found to prevent the Norwegian aquaculture industry from creating <b>shared</b> <b>value,</b> and the development licenses are further found to overcome some of these barriers. However, a substantial amount of barriers are still seen to be present after the implementation of the development license policy.
