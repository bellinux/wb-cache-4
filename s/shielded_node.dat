50|$|The Markov {{blanket of}} a node {{contains}} all {{the variables that}} <b>shield</b> the <b>node</b> {{from the rest of}} the network. This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behavior of that node. The term was coined by Judea Pearl in 1988.|$|R

Assuming a skewed degree distribution, we give a local uniform caching and search algorithm based on bond percolation, which automatically <b>shields</b> low connectivity <b>nodes</b> from traffic and reduces total traffic to scale sub-linearly with network size. For power-law networks with exponent ≈ 2, total traffic scales as O(N 1 / 2 log 2 N) {{as opposed to}} O(N log N) for broadcast schemes. 1...|$|R

System contains 2 sensor-actuator nodes, and 1 controller node connected to Ethernet network through Ethernet <b>Shield</b> board. Sensor-actuator <b>node</b> with DHT 11 sensor works for taking environment informations such as temperature, air humidity, and light intensity, runs actuation {{in the form}} of emulating LED lights; and communicates with controller node which will process data using serial wire as a communication tool between nodes. Monitoring datas and user control interface is provided by controller node which can be accessed online in web browser. The system ability for monitoring environment in greenhouse and online access of environmental data generates controllable and automatic monitoring and management of plants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks {{continue}} to be a major problem on the Internet. While many defense mechanisms have been created, they all have significant deployment issues. This paper introduces a novel method that overcomes these issues, allowing a small number of deployed DoS defenses to act as secure on-demand <b>shields</b> for any <b>node</b> on the Internet. The proposed method is based on rerouting any packet addressed to a protected autonomous system (AS) through an intermediate filtering node—a shield. In this way, all potentially harmful traffic could be discarded before reaching the destination. The mechanisms for packet rerouting use existing routing techniques and do not require any kind of modification to the deployed protocols or routers. To make the proposed system feasible, from both deployment and usage points of view, traffic rerouting and outsourced filtering could be provided as an insurance-style on-demand service...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer Grids are {{collaborative}} distributed computing/data proc-essing systems, {{characterized by}} large scale, heterogeneity, lack of central con-trol, unreliable components and frequent dynamic changes in both topology and configuration. In such systems, {{it is desirable}} to maintain and make widely ac-cessible timely and up-to-date information about shared resources available to the active participants. Accordingly we introduce a scalable searching frame-work for locating and retrieving dataset replica information in random unstruc-tured peer-to-peer Grids built on the Internet, based on a widely known uniform caching and searching algorithm. Such algorithm is based on bond percolation, a mathematical phase transition model well suited for random walk searches in random power law networks, which automatically <b>shields</b> low connectivity <b>nodes</b> from traffic and reduces total traffic to scale sub-linearly with network size. The proposed schema is {{able to find the}} requested information reliably end efficiently, even if every node in the network starts with a unique different set of contents as a shared resources...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems very}} likely that {{missions}} with nano-satellites in professional scientific or commercial applications will not be single-satellite missions. Well structured formations or less structured swarms of nano-satellites {{will be able to}} perform tasks that cannot be done in the “traditional” way. The Dutch space-born radio telescope project OLFAR, the Orbiting Low Frequency Array, {{is a good example of}} a typical “swarm task”. The OLFAR radio telescope will be composed of an antenna array based on nano-satellites orbiting the moon to <b>shield</b> the receiving <b>nodes</b> from terrestrial interference. The array will receive frequencies in a band from around 30 kHz to 30 MHz. This frequency band is scientifically very interesting, since it will be able to detect signals originating from the yet unseen “Dark Ages” ranging from the Big Bang until around 400 million year after. Another science driver is the LF activity from (exo) planets. In this paper the design parameters for the satellites and the swarm will be given and status of the OLFAR project will be reported. Details will be given about the antenna system, the LF-receiver and the signals that are expecte...|$|R
40|$|Shielding {{critical}} links enhances network robustness {{and provides}} {{a new way of}} designing robust networks. We first consider shielding critical links to guarantee network connectivity after any failure under geographical and general failure models. We develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to obtain the minimum cost shielding to guarantee the connectivity of a single source-destination (SD) pair under a general failure model, and exploit geographical properties to decompose the shielding problem under a geographical failure model. We extend our MILP formulation to guarantee the connectivity of the entire network, and use Benders decomposition to significantly reduce the running time by exploiting its partial separable structure. We extend the algorithms to guarantee partial network connectivity, and observe that significantly less shielding is required, especially when the failure region is small. To mitigate the effect of random link failures on network connectivity, we consider increasing the effective min-cut of the network by shielding, where shielded links cannot be contained in effective cuts. For a single SD pair, we develop an efficient algorithm to increase the effective min-cut by one, and develop a MILP with a small number of constraints to increase the effective min-cut by an arbitrary value. Then we extend the MILP to obtain the optimal shielding to increase the effective min-cut for the entire network, which can be used to solve realistic size problems. Finally, we consider <b>shielding</b> critical <b>nodes</b> in random graphs. We demonstrate the importance of high degree nodes in random graphs constructed under the configuration model. The occupancy of higher degree nodes leads to a larger size of the giant component. Moreover, shielding a small fraction of nodes in power law random graphs guarantees the existence of a giant component if the exponent is less than three. by Jianan Zhang. Thesis: S.

40|$|Myocytes are {{electrically}} {{coupled by}} gap junctions, which {{are composed of}} low-resistance intercellular channels. The major cardiac gap junction protein is connexin 43 (Cx 43). The distribution of Cx 43 has been studied by immunofluorescence to visualize the electrical coupling between atrial tissue and sinoatrial node. From modeling studies, this coupling was inferred to be gradual in order to <b>shield</b> the sinoatrial <b>node</b> from the atrial hyperpolarizing influence. The actual Cx 43 labeling pattern did not show the expected gradient but instead a rather black and white staining in a striking pattern of strands of cells. We used an immunohistochemical marker (anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha SMA]) that specifically cross-reacts with guinea pig sinoatrial node cells together with Cx 43 antibody to stain previously electrophysiologically mapped sinoatrial nodes. We found that in the guinea pig sinoatrial node the impulse originates in an alpha SMA-positive, virtually Cx 43 -negative, region (primary pacemaker region). The impulse then travels obliquely upward to the crista terminalis through a region where layers of alpha SMA-positive cells alternate with layers of Cx 43 -positive SMA-negative cells. The layers of Cx 43 -positive cells appear to become broader and thicker {{in the direction of}} the crista terminalis, whereas the layers of alpha SMA-positive cells become thinner and narrower. Lateral contacts between Cx 43 - and alpha SMA-positive cells were very sparse and only detected where the Cx 43 -positive strands ended (the region where alpha SMA-positive cells fill the whole space between endocardium and epicardium, ie, the putative primary pacemaker region). From these results, we conclude that the primary pacemaker is shielded from the hyperpolarizing influence of the atrium by a gradient in coupling brought about by tissue geometric factors rather than by a gradient of gap junction densit...|$|R
