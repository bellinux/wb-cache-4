5|$|Supermarkets, {{convenience}} stores, and {{gas stations}} in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing {{more than two}} retail distribution licenses.

50|$|Simpsons-Sears began {{operating}} full-line (department) {{stores in}} 1953. Internally, {{these have been}} classified by size, volume {{and the extent of}} merchandise selection. In the early decades, classifications were based on a letter designation, mirroring founding American parent, Sears, Roebuck and Co.: 'A' <b>Stores</b> <b>were</b> large full-line <b>stores,</b> 'B' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> smaller full-lines, serving more-mid-sized markets, while 'D' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> early <b>stores</b> serving small markets, normally offering mostly hard-line and home departments, with a catalogue desk. the 'D' <b>stores</b> <b>were</b> phased out in the early 1960s. Small stores, denoted 'S.S.' and serving similar markets to the original 'D' <b>Stores,</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the 1980s.

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various <b>stores</b> <b>are</b> scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the <b>stores</b> <b>are</b> also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E
