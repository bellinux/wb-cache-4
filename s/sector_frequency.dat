40|$|This paper investigates {{transport}} providers' {{preferences for}} alternative loading bays and pricing policies. It estimates {{the importance of}} loading bays, the probability of finding them free and offers strategically relevant information to policy makers. The results underline the relevance of both preference heterogeneity and non-linear attribute effects. Three classes of agents are detected with substantially different preferences also characterized by non-linear sensitivity to attribute level variations. The specific freight <b>sector,</b> <b>frequency</b> of accesses and number of employees are all relevant covariates explaining different preferences for alternative transport providers' categories. The implications of the results obtained are illustrated by simulating alternative policy scenarios. In conclusion, the paper underlines the need for rigorous policy analysis if the correct policy outcomes are to be estimated with an adequate level of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{pre-existing}} reduction technique {{suitable for}} the analysis of mistuned bladed disk dynamics, the Component Mistuning Model technique (CMM), originally developed exclusively for the use of blade frequency mistuning pattern, is improved in order to allow for the introduction of a <b>sector</b> <b>frequency</b> mistuning pattern. If either mistuning is not confined to the blades (i. e. blades-to-disk interface mistuning), or the blades cannot be removed from the bladed disk (i. e. integral bladed disks), sector mistuning rather than blade mistuning is a more suitable choice to perturb the tuned system. The new version of the original technique is referred as CMM Upgrade (CMMU). After a theory review of the original technique, the modifications leading to the CMMU are described. Finally the proposed CMMU technique is validated in terms of both modal parameters estimation and forced response calculation, by means of a dummy bladed disk developed at Politecnico di Torino...|$|E
40|$|Clonal {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to describe the cellular parameters of leaf development in American Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense). Sectors (clones) induced before leaf initiation indicate that the leaf primordium arises from ~ 100 cells on the flank of the shoot meristem. An analysis of <b>sector</b> <b>frequency</b> during the period of leaf expansion suggests that the rate of cell division is fairly uniform throughout the length of the leaf, but is lower at the margin of the lamina than in intercalary regions. The shapes of marginal sectors indicate that the orientation of cell division (as defined by the orientation of the new cell wall) in this region is more often parallel to the margin than perpendicular to it, although the degree of polarization varies {{along the length of the}} margin. There is a slight gradient in the duration of cell division along the length of of the lamina late in development, with cell division ceasing progressively from the lamina tip to the base over two cell cycles. The parameters of cell division in cotton are therefore similar to those described for tobacco with the notable exception of the behavior of cells at the leaf margin...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) {{system in which}} each sector is allocated a fixed set of frequency bands. Due to spatial variation {{in the nature of}} interference, a voice call originating in a sector may have an acceptable signal to noise ratio only on a subset of the <b>sector's</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Given a Poisson traffic arrival distribution, we derive estimates of the sector blocking probability. In particular, we present lower bounds that are independent of the specific call allocation algorithm, and also examine specific call assignment algorithms such as Repacking, Least Busy and Optimal Random Routing. We develop a simple heuristic that allows us to obtain fast and accurate sector blocking probability estimates. The latter serve as crucial inputs for the design and optimization of capacity and coverage in TDMA networks. 1.

40|$|Dry maize seeds, of {{a genetic}} stock {{heterozygous}} for the yellow-green locus (Yg^ Λ ^) ι were irradiated with fission neutron doses up to 2700 rads and with 250 kVp X-rays to 40 000 rads. The frequency of yellow-green (yg) sectors in seedling leaves 4 and 5 {{is largely a}} measure of the frequency of breakage (or incomplete exchange) and loss of the part of the short arm of chromosome I X carrying Yj>. Plots of dose versus yj* <b>sector</b> <b>frequency</b> per leaf show a linear increase with neutrons which reaches a maximum (leaf 4 = S. 5, leaf 5 = 2. 5) followed by a rapid decline; and a curvilinear increase with X-rays reaching a higher maximum (leaf 4 = 8. 5, leaf 5 = 3. 6) followed by a decrease. The observed rise and subsequent fall of numbers of yg_ mutations can be accounted for by a model in which the decline of the curves is due to cell killing which may also be due to chromosome breakage and deletion. The interpretation is based on the principles of the dual action theory, which explains radiobiological action in terms of microdosimetry. One of the observations accounted for is the higher maximum mutation rate for X-rays as compared to neutrons. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{primordia}} of angiosperm {{leaves are}} derived from {{a large number of}} cells sequestered approximately one plastochron before the visible outgrowth from the meristem surface. Over 100 cells are sequestered into the primordium early in development of the cotton leaf. The cell lineage patterns in the lamina of different shaped leaves of the cotton plant are shown to be similar. The rate of cell division is uniform throughout the lamina late in development and cell division ceases {{at the base of the}} leaf soon after it ceases in the leaf tip. <b>Sector</b> <b>frequency</b> differences at the margin and in submarginal regions provide no evidence for the existence of a marginal meristem. ^ Morphometric studies indicate that the Okra mutation of cotton exerts a morphogenetic effect early in leaf development. To investigate the nature of the interactions with other tissues in the primordium, genetic mosaics comprised of tissue containing the Okra (L 2 o) leaf shape mutation and wild-type tissue were made. The presence of the mutation in different layers of the meristem results in distinctive phenotypes. Periclinal mosaics containing the mutation in the L 1 -derived layer results in a partially Okra phenotype. No periclinal mosaics were obtained containing mutant tissue in the sub epidermal region (L 2) in an otherwise wild type leaf, but sectorial mosaics indicate that the presence of the mutation in this layer also induces the Okra phenotype. Periclinal mosaics containing the mutation in only the middle mesophyll of the leaf (L 3 layer) produce a dramatic alteration in pattern in that the lobes increase in length (a characteristic of the Okra mutation) but does not alter the width of the lamina. The absence of puckered and ripped tissue in the mosaics due to differential growth of the constituent mutant and wild-type tissue suggests that the Okra mutation acts early in development and that factors exist which can accommodate for the alterations caused by the differential growth of the components of the mosaic. These results illustrate ways in which the meristematic layers interact and how this interaction may be regulated during morphogenesis in higher plants. ...|$|E

He distinguished three forms of subjective stroboscopy which he called alpha, beta, and gamma: Alpha stroboscopy occurs at 8-12 cycles per second; the wheel appears to become stationary, although [...] "some sectors spokes {{look as though they}} are performing a hurdle race over the standing ones" [...] (p. 48). Beta stroboscopy occurs at 30-35 cycles per second: [...] "The distinctness of the pattern has all but disappeared.

Gamma stroboscopy occurs at 40-100 cycles per second: [...] "The disk appears almost uniform except that at all <b>sector</b> <b>frequencies</b> a standing grayish pattern is seen ... in a quivery sort of standstill" [...] (pp. 49-50). Schouten interpreted beta stroboscopy, reversed rotation, as consistent with there being Reichardt detectors in the human visual system for encoding motion. Because the spoked wheel patterns he used (radial gratings) are regular, they can strongly stimulate detectors for the true rotation, but also weakly stimulate detectors for the reverse rotation.|$|R

A collection of unique p 1 gene alleles was used, which carry Ac insertions at different sites in and near the p 1 locus, outside of the direct repeats, within the direct repeat sequences, and between the direct repeats, in both orientations. Recombination was scored by the numbers of colorless pericarp <b>sectors</b> (somatic <b>frequency)</b> and heritable mutations (germinal frequency).

Methods A split-mouth study design was used for 24 orthodontic patients, allocated randomly to 2 subgroups with differing frequencies of Duraphat varnish (Colgate-Palmolive, New York, NY) application. Repeated measures of the degree of demineralization were taken on the vestibular surfaces of 12 teeth (6 varnished and 6 unvarnished controls). Measurements were taken at 4 sites using a DIAGNOdent Pen 2190 laser (KaVo, Biberach an der Riss, Germany) and then subjected to statistical analysis. Results Generalized linear model and coefficient model analysis showed differences in the degrees of demineralization between treated and untreated teeth, but this was not statistically significant in terms of time point, frequency of application, or specific tooth site. However, when we analyzed the position of the teeth, the varnished anterior teeth showed a statistically significant reduction in demineralization compared with their unvarnished counterparts.
