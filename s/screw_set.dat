5000|$|This {{long and}} widely used engine {{arrangement}} was adjusted by turning a <b>screw</b> <b>set</b> {{in the end}} of the rocker that pressed {{on the end of the}} pushrod. This adjustment was made by rotating the engine until the cam was at its lowest point, giving the widest gap, then adjusting the rocker until this gap was at the correct spacing, as measured with the use of a feeler gauge.|$|E
50|$|This process {{functions}} like a cutter suction dredger, but {{the cutting tool}} is a rotating Archimedean <b>screw</b> <b>set</b> {{at right angles to}} the suction pipe. The first widely used auger dredges were designed in the 1980s by Mud Cat Dredges, which was run by National Car Rental, but is now a Division of Ellicott Dredges. In 1996, IMS Dredges introduced a self-propelled version of the auger dredge that allows the system to propel itself without the use of anchors or cables. During the 1980s and 1990s auger dredges were primarily used for sludge removal applications from waste water treatment plants. Today, auger dredges are used for a wider variety of applications including river maintenance and sand mining.|$|E

50|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screw</b> collars {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the <b>set</b> <b>screw.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> causes damage to the shaft - a flare-up of shaft material - which makes the collar harder to adjust or remove. It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> locations to eliminate this problem.|$|R
50|$|It is a <b>screw</b> <b>set</b> {{into the}} {{breechblock}} {{that has a}} section of thread along its axis removed. The screw is mated with a partially threaded hole {{at the rear of}} the weapon's chamber: threadless channels in the breechblock screw line up with threadless channels in the breech, and vice versa. The screw can thus be smoothly inserted all the way into the gun, after which as little as one-sixth of a turn can engage the two sets of threads securely, sealing the breech. Interrupted screws are occasionally seen in loose gunpowder rifles, as this mechanism was historically one of the few practical ways to achieve a gas-proof seal with a breech-loading firearm that does not employ cartridges. An earlier method was the use of a wedge to block the rear of the gun.|$|E
5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the <b>screw.</b> <b>Set</b> screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{conflict}} {{of interest in the}} treatment of intracapsular femoral neck fractures and the outcomes. The aim of this study was evaluation the treatment outcomes of closed and open reduction and internal fixation with screw in 18 - 50 -year-old patients. Materials and Methods: This clinical randomized study was conducted in Ayatollah Kashani Center in Isfahan from Nov 2010 to Nov 2011. In 42 patients selected in a randomized manner, fractures were reduced by closed reduction or open if necessary and C-ARM was controlled in AP and lateral plans. Movement range and femur pain severity were evaluated according to Visual analogue Scale (VAS) score at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Data were analyzed by SPSS 18. Chi-square, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, mean, and mean deviation were used. Results: Forty-two patients with femoral neck fracture were treated by open [31 patients (73. 8 %) ] or closed reduction [11 patients (26. 2 %) ] and also osteosynthesis. Their mean age was 47. 3 ± 9. 8 years; 29 of them were males and 13 were females. Twelve patients had bad range of motion (ROM) (28. 6 %), 16 had intermediate ROM (38 %), and 14 had good ROM (33. 4 %). After 6 months, 12 patients (28. 6 %) had bad ROM, 10 (23. 8 %) had intermediate ROM, and 20 (47. 6 %) had good ROM. There were 11 cases of non-union (35. 5 %) in the open reduction group and 4 in the closed group. Conclusion: This study showed that femoral neck fracture is associated with several complications, especially if open reduction was necessary. So, the surgical method and necessary equipments such as radiolucent bed, C-ARM machine, and implant cannulated <b>screw</b> <b>set</b> should be considered...|$|E
50|$|Most {{household}} {{door handles}} use a simple mechanism with a screw-style axle (called a spindle) that {{has at least}} one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed {{on each side of the}} door to which the handles are attached. Some handles are attached on both sides by screwing or sliding them directly onto the spindle, and then securing one or more retaining <b>screws</b> (<b>set</b> <b>screws)</b> through the knob perpendicular to the flat of the spindle. Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the <b>set</b> <b>screw,</b> which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of <b>set</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

5000|$|For longer life, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{are usually}} made {{of alloy steel}} and case hardened. Hardened <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> often leave a plastic deformation, {{in the form of}} a {{circular}} or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the <b>screw</b> <b>sets</b> against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially [...] "making its own detent" [...] on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis-assembly if a bearing or other tightly toleranced part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem.|$|R

50|$|A <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used {{to secure}} an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|R

5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T.

This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> product line.

40|$|In this study, the {{reinforcement}} by screws for {{the wood}} {{perpendicular to the}} grain subjected to a rotational moment has been studied. For the estimation of rotational stiffness and yield moment, the reinforcement effect by the screws which varies depending on their position under the bearing plate was evaluated by taking the internal displacement distribution of the wood into account. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to investigate the internal displacement distri-bution of the wood. Then an appropriate function was found out to meet well with various internal displacement distri-butions under the bearing plate. The equations, which can estimate rotational stiffness and yield moment of the bearing performance of the wood reinforced by screws, were derived from the shear resistance mechanism between the screw and wood by considering their relative displacement distribution. Then rotational tests were carried out with the wood reinforced by the <b>screws,</b> <b>setting</b> <b>screw</b> thread at the various positions. Agreements between prediction and experimental results were very well. It was found that the screw reinforcement was effective, provided screw length should be longer for the wood height...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{depth gauge}} has been {{designed}} to ensure, easily and quickly, the proper length of screws in bone surgery. The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end.
