5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides.

5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> was moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{building}} is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the Beinecke Library, containing the King's Library with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton. The new facility, costing Â£26 million, has a capacity for seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers, which are retrieved by robots, from the 162.7 miles of temperature and humidity-controlled <b>storage</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Digital Devil Saga was principally {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, {{who had worked}} on multiple previous Megami Tensei titles. Some tracks from the first game were composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> of the CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. For the sound compression, Meguro used ATRAC3 compression software. Using the software, Meguro was able to fit in high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he needed to make some compromises on tracks.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital <b>storage</b> <b>space,</b> weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E

5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{three years}} after the first Quaker {{settlers}} arrived in the area, a meeting house was constructed {{on the site of the}} present-day Friends meeting house for US$1,000. Quakers continued to flow into the area through the 1860s and in 1874 the current Friends meeting house was constructed and it has seen little change since it was built. Some minor alterations have taken place, including the addition of a concrete porch to the entryway and a shed on the east (rear) facade. The shed was added around 1910 to serve as a <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> and a privy. The building became a social, political, and religious hub for the area Quakers and the site was visited by Friends from other meeting houses around the state. The building is no longer owned by a religious institution, though there are occasional services held there.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's <b>storage</b> <b>space</b> into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
