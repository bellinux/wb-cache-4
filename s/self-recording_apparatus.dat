40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{possibility}} of using the technic of thermal derivatography for structure and main constituent analysisof biologic concretions, with special ref-erence to renal tract calculi. I) UVALâ€™S EXAMINATION by thermal gravimetry of nearly 1000 chemical precipitates (1) had suggested to one of us the employment of thermal methods in the analysis of concretions of biologic origin. Indeed, use of the thermogravimetric technic was made in conjunction with infrared spectrophotometry (2) and X-ray crystallography (3) in investiga-tions concerning tile formation mechanism of renal tract and gall-bladder calculi. The present work was designed to test tile idea of applying thermal derivatography, a conibined gravimetric and differential thermoanalytic method (4, 5), to renal tract calculus analysis. Methods and Materials The instrument employed in this study was an MOM OD- 102 derivato-graph (MOM, Budapest). The derivatograph combines in a single <b>self-recording</b> <b>apparatus</b> a derivative thermobalance and a differential thermoanalytic unit. A detailed account on the principle, construction, and operation of the instrument has been reported (4). Tile curve which marks the weight changes of the substance heated is the thermogravimetric curve, TG in Fig. 1. The derivative of this curve, a measure of weight changes with respect to time, is the DTG curve, whereas the curve which records heat energy or enthalpy changes during pyrolysis is the DTA or differential thermoanalytic curve.
