25|$|Rather than {{continuing}} the Amiens battle {{past the point}} of initial success, as had been done <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E
25|$|McQueen's next change {{occurred}} {{in that same}} year, when Lindley Evans was appointed as music teacher. McQueen believed that the teachers appointed to his school should not only have great ability in their chosen field, but also have imagination {{and be prepared to}} be innovators. McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he could lift the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing. The school won it <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> fact, that the shield became the permanent property of the school.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Caledonia" [...] {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in Morrison's life and career. Biographer Ritchie Yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> his career that he [...] "seems to be obsessed with the word". In his 2009 biography, Erik Hage found [...] "Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term Caledonia (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain)". As well as being his daughter Shana's middle name, it is the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, his parents' record store in Fairfax, California in the 1970s, and he also recorded a cover of the song [...] "Caldonia" [...] (with the name spelled [...] "Caledonia") in 1974. Morrison used [...] "Caledonia" [...] in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, [...] "Listen to the Lion" [...] with the lyrics, [...] "And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia". As late as 2008, Morrison used [...] "Caledonia" [...] as a mantra in the live performance of the song, [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] recorded at the two Hollywood Bowl concerts.|$|E

500|$|In the quarter-finals Lee {{defeated}} O'Sullivan 5–4 in a {{match that}} lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that {{enabled him to}} claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long pot in the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, [...] "Everyone knows I've been in front <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the past and tossed it away so I was having nightmares out there". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four. After the match Maguire {{he said he had}} [...] "starting to think about winning it now".|$|E
2500|$|For [...] "Wonder Woman," [...] Amuro asked Ai and Tsuchiya to {{collaborate}} with her, as she {{wanted to create a}} strong song with a chorus of female vocalists.

2500|$|The 1985 Florida Gators {{entered the}} contest on a roll: coming off an {{emotional}} {{win over the}} Auburn Tigers, undefeated, and ranked No. 1 in the nation {{for the first time}} in school history. [...] This would not be a repeat of the 1984 game, however. [...] As they had done <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the past, the Bulldogs spoiled Florida's season, defeating the Gators 24–3 with freshmen running backs Keith Henderson and Tim Worley both rushing for over 100 yards.|$|E

50|$|There is {{no proof}} that this event {{actually}} transpired {{but the fact that}} West has chosen to tell it <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> is <b>in</b> itself significant. Firstly, there is the idea of failure at baseball, the national pastime, which would indicate failure as an American. Secondly, the specific image of the persecuted human fleeing from his tormentors is an all too familiar archetype of pogroms and persecutions. This image would later figure as a key symbol in West's final novel The Day of the Locust. The general notion of a society looking for a scapegoat, and finding one {{in the form of a}} hapless fool, would echo in both Miss Lonelyhearts and A Cool Million.|$|R

60|$|A blank, dead quiet {{settled down}} over the bleachers and stands. Something fearful threatened. What might not come to pass, even {{at the last moment}} of this nerve-racking game? There was a runner on first and a runner on second. That was bad. Exceedingly bad was it that these runners were on base with nobody out. Worst of all was the fact that Kane was up. Kane, the best bunter, the fastest man to first, the hardest hitter in the league! That he would fail to advance those two runners was {{scarcely}} worth consideration. Once advanced, a fly to the outfield, a scratch, anything almost, would tie the score. So this was the climax presaged <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> earlier <b>in</b> the game.

40|$|Many male animals wield {{ornaments}} or {{weapons of}} exaggerated proportions.
