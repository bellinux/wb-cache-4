In this paper, the thermosetting polyimide (PI) nano-fibers based nonwoven separators have been developed by electrospining technique and followed by thermal imidization and mechanical pressing with improved thermal stability and considerable mechanical strength. The high concentration of tortuous nanopores structure and intrinsic chemical configuration lead to good ionic transport and improved electrolyte wettability. The electrochemical characterization at high temperature of 120 degrees C demonstrates that the LiBOB/PC soaked polyimide nonwovens is an excellent electrolyte system for high temperature operation owing to possessing high oxidative potential, excellent lithium deposition-stripping performance and considerable ionic conductivity. The cells using LiBOB/PC soaked polyimide nonwovens as separator still exhibit stable charge-discharge profiles with quantitative coulumbic efficiency and satisfactory cydability at 120 degrees C. The superior electrochemical performance at high temperature could endow these polyimide nonwovens promising alternative to PP separators for high power or high temperature application with superior <b>safety</b> <b>characteristic.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

According to international standards, {{one of the reasons}} for this <b>safety</b> <b>characteristic</b> of GESs is that medium-voltage and low-voltage grounding systems form a quasi-equipotential area. Typical examples of GESs are in city centers due to the high number of interconnected grounding systems in the area.

In this paper, a model based on the Maxwell's subareas method (MaSM) is used to evaluate how buried metallic parts, which are not intentionally connected to ground grids, modify the electric potential on the soil surface. First, the MaSM model is validated with experimental measurements on a simple electrode configuration.
