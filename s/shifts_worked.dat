40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{study the}} {{association}} of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and lifestyle behaviors. Methods: Workers participating in the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study (2008 and 2009) (N = 5951) reported night and <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> weight and height. Groups included stable night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from day work to night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> to day work, and no night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in 2008 and 2009. Regression analyses were used to study association changes in night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and changes in lifestyle behaviors. Results: A larger weight change was seen in normal-weight workers changing from day to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> ([beta] = 0. 93 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 to 1. 85) compared with stable no shift workers. No further associations of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change were observed, neither in normal-weight, overweight, and obese workers. Conclusions: Despite the fact that starting night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is associated with some unhealthy lifestyle habits, {{this study did not}} confirm a positive association of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change over 1 year, except for normal-weight workers moving from day to <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} find out the work load of matrons under <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in a special nursing home for the elderly (SNH), six healthy female matrons volunteered to {{participate}} in the present study. For each subject, care working time, heart rate, walking steps, estimated energy expenditure and working time in different postures were determined during day <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (540 min) and night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (960 min). Although the time on duty, working and recess were significantly longer in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> than day <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> the percentages of working and recess time to duty time were nearly the same regardless of <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The longest care <b>work</b> in each <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was individual care of residents in the SNH. The maximum, minimum and mean heart rate and percentages to estimated maximal heart rate were similar in each <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Although total walking steps in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> were significantly larger than those in day <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> steps per hour did not differ between them. The estimated total energy expenditure (kcal) was significantly higher in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> than in day shift work; however, the work intensity (kcal/kg/min) was significantly higher in day <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The longest length and larger percentage of working time were observed in standing posture in each <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> These findings suggest that physical activity and energy expenditure of matrons under either <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in the SNH seem to be high. Further studies are needed to clarify the work load of matrons engaged in SNH to formulate countermeasures...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> is a {{major feature}} of modern work practices. It {{involves}} individuals working at times considered unconventional for most workers, such as at night. Although the community often benefits from such <b>work</b> practices, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> can be hazardous, for both the workers and the community. The thesis reviews the main problems of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> especially when involving night work. These are: an increased risk for accidents and errors; increased sleepiness and fatigue due to difficulties sleeping; increased health problems; and disruption to family and social life. Strategies to limit the risk associated with these hazards are also reviewed, and include using knowledge of circadian principles to plan shift schedules, sleeping schedules and meal times; planned napping; consideration of the work environment; and newer techniques such as using bright lights and melatonin. While this information is known to the research community, it has not filtered down to many <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> workplaces and thus has had little if any positive effect on actual <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> practices. For a change in <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> practices to occur, the research knowledge must become available to every <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> workplace, as must some incentive or motivation to ensure that workplaces make the necessary changes. The Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws provide such a framework. Considering <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> as an OHS hazard would ensure that all <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> workplaces identified the hazards of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> conducted a risk assessment to identify the risk associated with the hazards, and then implemented the appropriate strategies, from the hierarchy of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> hazard control measures, for both employers and employees, to fulfil their duty of care to minimise the risks. Considering <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> as an OHS issue would ensure that the research information was used as intended - to improve the safety, performance, {{and quality of life}} of all shift workers.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and chronic disease is mediated by an increase in obesity. However, investigations of the relationship between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity reveal mixed findings. Using a recently developed exposure assessment tool, this study examined the association between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity among Canadian women from two studies: a cohort of university alumni, and a population-based study. Self-administered questionnaire data were used from healthy, currently employed females in a population-based study, the Ontario Women's Diet and Health case-control study (n = 1611 controls), and from a subset of a of university alumni from the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle, and Health (n = 1097) cohort study. Overweight was defined as BMI≥ 25 to < 30, and obesity as BMI≥ 30. Reported occupation was converted to occupational codes and linked to a probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> value derived from Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics data. Regular evenings, nights, or rotating <b>work</b> comprised <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Polytomous logistic regression estimated the association between probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> categorized as near nil, low, medium, and high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> on overweight and obesity, controlling for detected confounders. In the population-based sample, high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with obesity (reference = near nil probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> OR: 1. 88, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 3. 51, p = 0. 047). In the alumni cohort, no significant association was detected between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and overweight or obesity. As these analyses found a positive association between high probability of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure and obesity in a population-based sample, but not in an alumni cohort, it is suggested that the relationship between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity is complex, and may be particularly susceptible to occupational and education-related factors within a given population...|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office as Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, Sir Norman ordered a review of <b>shifts</b> <b>worked</b> by {{officers}} claiming they did not provide the best service {{to the public as}} they included four rest days when officers were not at work.A new shift pattern consisting of two distinct patterns referred to as VSA 1 and VSA 2 (variable shift arrangement) was produced and commenced in March 2008. Response officers worked VSA 1 and neighbourhood policing teams worked VSA 2. Interestingly, the VSA 2 still included four rest days for officers. Officers posted to Communications Division were allowed to continue working the more popular previous shift pattern, FSDR (Force Standard Duty Rosta) as Communications Division had been able to successfully argue that VSA was not fit for purpose for their requirements. The VSA 1 proved deeply unpopular with many officers claiming that they were more tired than they had been working the previous shift pattern. A report leaked from the Police Federation to local media suggested that there had been an increase of 16,000 hours of sickness between April and August 2008, a 3.4% increase on the previous year.After pressure by the police federation a further review was taken and VSA 1 was re-designed and commenced in April 2009.

40|$|This review summarises the {{literature}} on <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> {{and its relation to}} insufficient sleep, chronic diseases, and accidents. It is based on 38 meta-analyses and 24 systematic reviews, with additional narrative reviews and articles used for outlining possible mechanisms by which <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> may cause accidents and adverse health. Evidence shows that the effect of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> on sleep mainly concerns acute sleep loss in connection with night shifts and early morning shifts. A link also exists between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and accidents, type 2 diabetes (relative risk range 1. 09 - 1. 40), weight gain, coronary heart disease (relative risk 1. 23), stroke (relative risk 1. 05), and cancer (relative risk range 1. 01 - 1. 32), although the original studies showed mixed results.

Using longitudinal data from the National Survey of Families and Households, models are tested that assess the direct impact of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> on marital quality, and the effect of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> on marital quality intervening through marital interaction, job satisfaction, social isolation, and depression. Theoretically these models are testing the assumption that entering into a <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> situation will negatively impact marital quality by creating more social isolation, increased depression, lower job satisfaction, and less marital interaction. ^ The results of this study indicate changing work schedules over time has a significant, albeit small direct effect on marital quality. The results of the intervening model suggest <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> has little impact on those variables thought to interact with <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> to impact marital quality. Most significantly, results from both the direct and intervening models suggest that the presence and age of children has a significant interactive effect on the relationship between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and marital quality.

40|$|Introduction: While {{some studies}} have {{suggested}} associations between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity, few have been population-based or considered multiple shift schedules. Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is warranted. Methods: Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on <b>work</b> history (including <b>shift</b> <b>work),</b> height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data. Results: We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 34; 95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1. 05 – 1. 73) and obese (OR = 1. 57; 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 2. 21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Conclusion: Both the positive association between rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> {{in this study are}} consistent with previous findings.

40|$|Research question: To {{determine}} the incidence {{and level of}} work-related stress and burnout in midwives and contributing and protective demographic factors that may influence those levels. Participants and method: All registered midwives (152) working in two public hospital maternity units within the same health service district in NSW completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey and a demographic survey including care model, shift work, lifestyle data and exercise level. Findings: There was {{a response rate of}} 36. 8 % with 56 (56 / 152) midwives completing the surveys. Almost two thirds (60. 7 %) of midwives in this sample experienced moderate to high levels of emotional exhaustion, a third (30. 3 %) scoring low personal accomplishment and a third (30. 3 %) experiencing depersonalization related to burnout. Significant differences were found among groups of midwives according to years in the profession, <b>shifts</b> <b>worked,</b> how many women with multiple psychosocial issues were included in the midwife's workload and the midwife's uptake of physical exercise. Those midwives who had spent longer in the profession and exercised scored low burnout levels. Conclusion: The impact of years in the profession, <b>shifts</b> <b>worked,</b> how many women with multiple psychosocial issues were included in their workload and the midwife's level of exercise significantly affected how these midwives dealt with burnout and provided care for women.

40|$|Background. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> is {{associated}} with sleep and health problems. Tolerance to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is reported to decrease with age. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> tolerance {{should be considered in}} different <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between age, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure, <b>shift</b> type, and morningness and sleep/health problems in oil rig shift workers. Material and methods. A total of 199 workers participated. They worked either two weeks of 12 -h day shifts (n = 96) or two weeks of swing shifts (n = 103) (one week of 12 -h night shifts followed by one week of 12 -h day shifts), followed by four weeks off work. The workers filled out questionnaires on demographics, work, sleep, and health. Results. We found no significant associations between age or years of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure and any of the sleep, sleepiness, or health parameters. There was a significant association between shift type and sleep duration, showing that swing shift workers had longer sleep duration than day shift workers. In addition, we found a significant association between the interaction age*, shift type, and sleep duration, where sleep duration was negatively associated with age for the swing shift workers and positively associated with age for the day shift workers. There were significant associations between morningness and sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and insomnia. Conclusions. Older workers may tolerate <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> well. Age, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> exposure time, and shift type seemed not to affect <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> tolerance in this population.

40|$|Background: Environmental factors play a {{prominent}} role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aetiology. <b>Shift</b> <b>work</b> has previously been associated with increased RA risk in females. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential association, including a dose-response association, between permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and day-oriented <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and risk of developing anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) -positive and ACPA-negative RA. Methods: The present report is based on a population-based, case-control study with incident cases of RA (1951 cases and 2225 controls matched by age, gender and residential area). Using logistic regression, occurrence of RA among subjects who have been exposed to different kinds of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was compared with that among those who have never been exposed by calculating the OR with a 95 % CI. Results: Rotating <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and day-oriented <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> increased the risk of developing ACPA-positive RA (OR 1. 3, 95 %[*]CI 1. 0 to 1. 7 and OR 1. 3, 95 %[*]CI 1. 0 to 1. 6), but not ACPA-negative RA. Permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> appeared to be a protective factor both against ACPA-positive RA (OR 0. 7, 95 %[*]CI 0. 6 to 0. 9) and ACPA-negative RA (OR 0. 8, 95 %[*]CI 0. 6 to 1. 0). For both subsets of RA, significant trends showed a lower risk of developing RA with increasing duration of permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (p value for trend 0. 002 vs 0. 04). Conclusions: Sleep restriction as a consequence of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is associated with several biological effects among which changes in melatonin production may be involved.

In total, 26, 382 workers from Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort were included in this study. Information on <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> history was gathered through questionnaires and metabolic traits were measured. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for long-term <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> related with MetS and each component, respectively. Further stratification analysis was performed to detect the differences on MetS between female and male shift workers. Long-term <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with MetS without adjusting for any confounders. Compared with the group of non-shift work, the multivariate-adjusted ORs (95 %CI) of MetS associated with 1 - 10, 11 - 20, and ≥ 20 y of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> were 1. 05 (0. 95 - 1. 16), 1. 14 (1. 03 - 1. 26), 1. 16 (1. 01 - 1. 31), respectively. In female workers, we found a dose-response relationship that every 10 years increase in <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with a 10 % (95 % CI: 1 %- 20 %) elevated OR of MetS, while no significant dose-response trend was found among male workers. Furthermore, <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> duration was significantly associated with ORs of high blood pressure (1. 07, 1. 01 - 1. 13), long waist circumference (1. 10, 1. 01 - 1. 20) and high glucose levels (1. 09, 1. 04 - 1. 15). No significant association was observed between <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> and low HDL cholesterol) and raised triglyceride levels. Long-term <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was associated with metabolic syndrome and the association might differ by gender in retired workers. Applicable intervention strategies are needed for prevention of metabolic disorders for shift workers...|$|R
