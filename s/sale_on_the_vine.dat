Late harvest is usually an {{indication}} of a sweet dessert wine, such as late harvest Riesling. Late harvest grapes are often more similar to raisins, but have been naturally dehydrated while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vine.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ethephon}} and abscisic acid (ABA) application on ripening-related genes of pre-harvest ‘Kohi’ kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) were studied {{to clarify the}} possibility of <b>the</b> fruit ripening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vine.</b> <b>The</b> fruits were treated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vine</b> at mature stage with 250 [*]µL⋅L− 1 ethephon or 100 [*]µmol⋅L− 1 ABA, and the expression levels of chlorophyll synthase (AcCLS), chlorophyllase 1 (AcCLH 1), polygalacturonase (AcPG), expansin (AcEXP), β-amylase (Acβ-AM), sucrose synthase (AcSUSY), MADS-box SEPALLATA 4 /RIPENING INHIBITOR-like (AcSEP 4 /RIN) and FRUITFUL-like (AcTDR 4 /FUL) genes were analyzed. The expression levels of AcPG, AcEXP, Acβ-AM, and AcSUSY increased in the ethephon-treated fruit, but those of AcCLH 1 at 6 and 9 days after treatment and AcCLS decreased. Moreover, the expression levels of AcSEP 4 /RIN and AcTDR 4 /FUL, the latter of which is associated with ethylene biosynthesis, {{were higher in the}} ethephon-treated fruit. The expression level of each gene in ABA-treated fruit was not significantly {{different from that of the}} untreated control. The results suggest that ethephon application increases the expression levels of AcPG, AcEXP, Acβ-AM, AcSUSY, AcSEP 4 /RIN, and AcTDR 4 /FUL in ‘Kohi’ kiwifruit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>vine...</b>|$|R
