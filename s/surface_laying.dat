40|$|A {{recumbent}} cow is {{the clinical}} {{picture of a}} hypocalcaemia in the peripartal period. Hypocalcaemia is still the predominat disease (> 80 %) for cows becoming recumbent in this time period (Gelfert et al. 2005). The subtypes of recumbency due to hypocalcaemia, which are described in German articles, {{should be considered as}} autonomous diseases. Parturient paresis can be found more and more in younger cows, however, it is rarely found in heifers. The management of the farmes determines the clinical stage of hypocalcaemia in which the cows are detected (Gelfert et al. 2005). The better the management the higher is the ratio (up to 20 %) of cows suffering from hypocalcaemia and still being able to stand. The clinical picture depends from the size of the drop of calcium concentrations in blood. Recumbent cows with a reduced temperature of the body <b>surface,</b> <b>laying</b> in lateral position or having a disturbed sensorium have significantly lower calcium concentrations (Gelfert et al. 2005). Parallel to the calcium concentrations there is a drop of phosphorus concentrations, so that the majority of cows with parturient paresis show a combined hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia (Gelfert et al. 2005). The latter {{is the result of the}} hypocalcaemia (Gelfert et al. 2006 b). For the therapy of the parturient paresis, it is not important whether there is a combined hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia or a sole hypocalcaemia. A single intravenous infusion of a calcium solution results in a high success rate. The use of an additional drug beside the organic calcium solution did not influence the success rate after first treatment, the overall rate of healed animals and the number of treatments needed. (Gelfert et al. 2006 b). The success of treatment is influenced by other diseases like myopathy of ketosis/hepatosis which occur in combination with the hypocalcaemia. (Gelfert et al. 2007 a). In the case that a second treatment is needed, is is important to look for signs of myopathy or ketosis/hepatosis by additional clinical or serological examinations. According the results of these investigations, the therapy and addtional measurement has to be realigned. Increased serum activities of CK and AST at the time of the first treatment provide hints about myopathy; however, they do not provide additional information to improve the prognosis at that time (Gelfert et al. 2007 a). For a successful treatment it is crucial that the farmer take care of the sick animal. In case of myopathy, a box with plenteous bedding and a relocation of the cow several times a day are important. In recumbent cows, showing only a lack of phosphorus as deficiency in major elements, the reason of recumbency can be found elsewhere (myopathy, hepatosis, ketosis, severe mastitis, nerval disorders) (Gelfert et al. 2006 b). To prevent parturient paresis, cows are fed anionic salts (AS) in combination with total mix rations for the last three weeks before parturition. Several conditions must be fulfilled for a successful use of AS. Complications mainly occur due to faults in feding management. The result is an unjustified rejection of AS as method in the prevention of hypocalcaemia. The following conditions must be fulfilled when AS are used: The resulting Dietary Cation-Anion-Difference (DCAD) must be low. According the present results sufficient effects on acid-base-balance (ABB) and calcium metabolism can be expected if DCAD is below + 150 mEq/kg dry matter (DM) (Gelfert et al. 2007 b). These results are in contrast to the current doctrine, saying that DCAD must be below 0 mEq/kg DM. On the other hand, these results open up new possibilities in the use of AS in feed with high concentrations of potassium. This should be investigated in future studies. Regardless the initial DCAD in the feed ratio, the maximum dosis of AS is 3000 mEq/day. A higher dosis results in clinical acidosis and a severe reduction of feed intake. The tolerance of cows towards AS has a big individual variance, so that single cows might be able to consume much higher dosis (up to 6000 mEq/kg) without any impact on feed intake (Gelfert et al. 2006 d). The use of AS does not influence significantly the pH in rumen fluid and the productions of short-chain fatty acids (Gelfert et al. 2009 a). There are no differences between chloride and sulfate salts in the impact of ruminal pH. The impact of the various AS on ABB differs. CaCl 2 has the greatest impact on ABS in blood and urine and MgSO 4 has the weakest impact. When using AS for the prevention of hypocalcaemia, the salts with the greatest effect are preferred. After minimising the concentration of potassium as much as possible, CaCl 2 is the first choice because of its strong acidifying effects. The maximum concentration of chloride (8 g/kg DM) in the diet must be met. CaSO 4 is the second choice because it has the smallest side effects on feed intake and can be added up to the maximum permissible quantities of sulfate (4 g/kg DM) (Gelfert AS should be fed for a period of 2 or 3 weeks to guarantee the activation of the calcium metabolism. A longer feeding time may induce severe metabolic acidosis and hypocalcaemia (Gelfert et al. 2006 c). The total dosis of AS should be fed in several small portions during the day. As the feeding management demands the total amount of AS can be fed once daily. In this case, feeding AS once daily confined the risk of an interrupted effect of the anionic salts on the acid–base status as well as calcium metabolism after 12 h if other salts instead of calcium chloride are used (Gelfert et al. 2009 d). Feeding AS in combination with an energy-deficient diet causes severe non-compensated metabolic acidosis (Gelfert et al. 2008 a). When AS are used the dietary calcium concentration should be between 9 g and 12 g/kg DM (Gelfert und Staufenbiel 2008). The use of AS is not possible in diets low in calcium. Simultaneous application of AS and rumen buffer results in a loss of effectivity of AS. Neither an adequate acidification of blood nor an activation of calcium metabolism occurred. In feed ration for cows in the last weeks of pregnancy, rumen buffer are not allowed, if AS are given for prevention of parturient paresis. (Gelfert et al. 2006 a) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{hydrothermal}} synthesis {{of a single}} layer of zeolite Beta crystals on a molybdenum substrate for microreactor applications has been developed. Before the hydrothermal synthesis, {{the surface of the}} substrate was modified by an etching procedure that increases the roughness at the nanoscale level without completely eliminating the <b>surface</b> <b>lay</b> structure. Then, thin films of Al 2 O 3 (170 nm) and TiO 2 (50 nm) were successively deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the substrate. The internal Al 2 O 3 film protects the Mo substrate from oxidation up to 550 °C in an oxidative environment. The high wettability of the external TiO 2 film after UV irradiation increases zeolite nucleation on its surface. The role of the metal precursor (TiCl 4 vs TiI 4), deposition temperature (300 vs 500 °C), and film thickness (50 vs 100 nm) was investigated to obtain titania films with the slowest decay in the superhydrophilic behavior after UV irradiation. Zeolite Beta coatings with a Si/Al ratio of 23 were grown at 140 °C for 48 h. After ion exchange with a 10 - 4 M cobalt acetate solution, the activity of the coatings was determined in the ammoxidation of ethylene to acetonitrile in a microstructured reactor. A maximum reaction rate of 220 µmol C 2 H 3 N g- 1 s- 1 was obtained at 500 °C, with 42 % carbon selectivity to acetonitrile...|$|R
