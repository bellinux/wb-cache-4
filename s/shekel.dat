5|$|The Tyrian <b>shekel</b> weighed four Athenian drachmas, about 14grams, {{more than}} earlier 11-gram Israeli shekels, but was {{regarded}} as the equivalent for religious duties at that time. Because Roman coinage was only 80% silver, the purer (94% or more) Tyrian shekels were required to pay the temple tax in Jerusalem. The money changers referenced in the New Testament Gospels (Matt. 21:12 and parallels) exchanged Tyrian shekels for common Roman currency.|$|E
5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million <b>shekel.</b> The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{references}} to the purchase are ostensively contradictory about the purchase price; it is 50 <b>shekels</b> of silver according to , and 600 <b>shekels</b> of gold according to [...] However, this contradiction is only on the surface. The 50 <b>shekels</b> was the initial price to purchase the two oxen and the threshing floor, but the later price of 600 <b>shekels</b> was paid to purchase the property of Mount Moriah {{in addition to the}} oxen and threshing floor contained within and earlier purchased.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary {{religious}} authorities {{believe that}} the <b>Shekel</b> HaKodesh (Holy <b>Shekel)</b> of the Temple was larger and of purer silver content than the standard <b>Shekel</b> used for trade in ancient Israel. Halakha requires that the coins used have a requisite total amount of actual silver. There are varying opinions as to the correct amount of silver, they fall in between 100grams and 117grams. Coins which do not contain the requisite amount of silver do not result in a valid redemption.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, {{the system}} was reformed, perhaps under the {{influence}} of Egypt, so that a mina was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the <b>shekel</b> remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard mina was reduced. Moses mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of silver; thus each <b>shekel</b> coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical <b>shekel</b> was initially worth about 3⅓ denarii, but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.|$|E

25|$|There were, however, {{different}} versions of the talent/kikkar in use; a royal and a common version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light royal talent was often represented {{in the form of a}} duck, while the heavy royal talent often took the form of a lion. The mina for the heavy royal talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23lbs), while that for the heavy common talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17lbs); accordingly, the heavy common <b>shekel</b> would be about 15.87 grams (0.56oz). According to Josephus, it was the heavy common talent, and its mina and <b>shekel,</b> that was the normal measure of weight in Syria and Judea; Josephus also mentions an additional unit – the bekah – which was exactly half a <b>shekel.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the Israelite system, {{the ratio}} of the giru to the <b>shekel</b> was altered, and the talent, mina, and giru, later went by the names kikkar (ככר), litra, and gerah (גרה), respectively; litra is a loan word from Latin - libra, meaning pound.|$|E

25|$|The old temple {{built by}} Zerubbabel was {{replaced}} by a magnificent edifice. An agreement was made between Herod and the Jewish religious authorities: the sacrificial rituals, called offerings, were to be continued unabated for the entire time of construction, and the Temple itself would be constructed by the priests.

In 2013, Rabbinical court in Israel ordered a mother, Elinor Daniel, to circumcise her son or pay a fine of 500 Israeli <b>Shekel</b> for every day that the child is not circumcised.
