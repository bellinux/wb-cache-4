25|$|Bennett {{returned}} to <b>state</b> <b>duty</b> and helped New South Wales complete their second Shield title in three seasons. He scored 22 and took 3/39 {{in the first}} innings of an innings win over Queensland. Bennett then played a match-winning role against Victoria. After making 19 of his state's 310, he took 3/47 to secure a 67-run first innings lead. Defending a target of 269 in the second innings, Bennett took 6/57 to secure a close-run 25-run win.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} match of the 196869 season, Mallett took 2/30 and 3/80 in South Australia's match against the touring West Indies. He was {{selected}} for the First Test in Brisbane, but was attacked by the Caribbean tourists, taking a total of 1/88, his only wicket being Kanhai, and conceding almost five runs per over as Australia lost by 125 runs. After the defeat, Mallett was dropped. Returning to <b>state</b> <b>duty,</b> Mallett took 2/30 and 6/69 in the next match against New South Wales, helping {{to set up a}} three-wicket win. Two games later, he took 4/41 and 7/57, orchestrating an innings victory over Queensland. These efforts were not enough to win a recall to the Test team, and Mallett ended the season with 39 wickets at 23.15 as South Australia won the Sheffield Shield. He also scored 110 runs at 15.71 with a top-score of 24.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of the 23rd Cavalry Division's 56th Cavalry Brigade, and was commanded by Colonel Louis S. Davidson, the former executive officer of the 56th Brigade. Each summer from 1929 to 1939, the 124th conducted training at Camp Wolters. The regiment's designated mobilization training station was Fort Bliss. Between September and October 1929, the regiment was called up for <b>state</b> <b>duty</b> to enforce martial law during the breaking up of the organized crime organization in Borger. In May 1930, it was called up to restore order after the Sherman race riot. Between September 1931 and December 1932, the regiment was called up to enforce order and prevent illegal oil production in the East Texas Oil Field. On 29 November 1934, regimental executive officer Colonel Calvin B. Garwood took command of the regiment after Davidson was promoted to command the 56th Brigade. Between 1935 and 1939, the 124th was awarded the National Guard Association's Pershing Trophy for cavalry marksmanship.|$|E

Waugh ended the Sheffield Shield as the top-scorer, with 967 runs at 80.85, prompting the ABC to select him as its Player of the Year.

2500|$|The Oyo Mesi {{were seven}} {{principal}} councilors of the state. They constituted the Electoral Council and possessed legislative powers, similar to today's United States Congress. Led by the Bashorun, acting as prime minister, and ran by the Agbaakin, Samu, Alapini, Laguna, Akiniku and Ashipa. They represented {{the voice of}} the nation and had the chief responsibility of protecting the interests of the empire. The Alaafin was required to take counsel with them whenever any important matter affecting the state occurs. Each man had a <b>state</b> <b>duty</b> to perform at court every morning and afternoon. [...] Each mesi had a deputy whom they would send to the Alaafin if his absence was unavoidable. The Oyo Mesi developed as a check on the Alaafin's power, preventing the Alaafin from being an autocrat; the Oyo Mesi compelled many Afaafin to commit suicide during the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

[...] On September 4, Elizabeth Eckford was the only student to enter the school due to lack of communication. It is commonly mistaken that she was taking this stand on her own but rather it was because she was the only student who didn't have a phone so nobody could contact her to let her know the integration wasn't happening until the next day.|$|E
60|$|As an {{illustration}} of how a state monopoly may become a <b>state</b> <b>duty,</b> let us suppose that no gold existed in Australia, but {{that it had been}} found in immense quantities by one of our ships in some small and barren island. In this case it would plainly become the duty of the state to keep and work the mines for the public benefit, since by doing so, the gain would be fairly divided among the whole population by decrease of taxation; whereas by leaving it open to free trade while merely keeping the government of the island; we should certainly produce enormous evils during the first struggle for the precious metal, and should ultimately subside into the monopoly of some wealthy individual or great company, whose enormous revenue would not equally benefit the community. The nutmegs of Banda and the tin of Banca are to some extent parallel cases to this supposititious one, and I believe the Dutch Government will act most unwisely if they give up their monopoly.|$|E

6000|$|In Massachusetts {{they are}} again hardly honest. [...] "It is the right," [...] says the constitution, [...] "as {{well as the}} duty of all men in society {{publicly}} and at stated seasons to worship the supreme Being, the Great Creator and Preserver of the universe." [...] And then {{it goes on to}} say that every man may do so in what form he pleases; but further down it declares that [...] "every denomination of Christians, demeaning themselves peaceably and as good subjects of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law." [...] But what about those who are not Christians? In New Hampshire it is exactly the same. It is enacted that [...] "every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and reason." [...] And that [...] "every denomination of Christians, demeaning themselves quietly and as good citizens of the State, shall be equally under the protection of the law." [...] From all which it is, I think, manifest that the men who framed these documents, desirous above all things of cutting themselves and their people loose from every kind of trammel, still felt the necessity of enforcing religion--of making it, to a certain extent, a matter of <b>State</b> <b>duty.</b> In the first constitution of North Carolina it is enjoined [...] "that no person who shall deny the being of God, or the truth of the Protestant religion, shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit." [...] But this was altered in the year 1836, and the words [...] "Christian religion" [...] were substituted for [...] "Protestant religion." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, my Lords, we do contend, that, if any subject, {{under any}} name, or of any description, be {{not engaged in}} public, open rebellion, but {{continues}} to acknowledge the authority of his sovereign, and, if tributary, to pay tribute conformably to agreement, such a subject, in case of being suspected of having formed traitorous designs, ought to be treated in a manner totally different from that which was adopted by Mr. Hastings. If the Rajah of Benares had formed a secret conspiracy, Mr. Hastings had a <b>state</b> <b>duty</b> and a judicial duty to perform. He was bound, as Governor, knowing of such a conspiracy, {{to provide for the}} public safety; and as a judge, he was bound to convene a criminal court, and to lay before it a detailed accusation of the offence. He was bound to proceed publicly and legally against the accused, and to convict him of his crime, previous to his inflicting, or forming any intention of inflicting, punishment. I say, my Lords, that Mr. Hastings, as a magistrate, was bound to proceed against the Rajah either by English law, by Mahometan law, or by the Gentoo law; and that, by all or any of these laws, he was bound to make the accused acquainted with the crime alleged, to hear his answer to the charge, and to produce evidence against him, in an open, clear, and judicial manner. And here, my Lords, we have again to remark, that the Mahometan law is a great discriminator of persons, and that it prescribes the mode of proceeding against those who are accused of any delinquency requiring punishment, with a reference to the distinction and rank which the accused held in society. The proceedings are exceedingly sober, regular, and respectful, even to criminals charged with the highest crimes; and every magistrate is required to exercise his office in the prescribed manner. In the Hedaya, after declaring and discussing the propriety of the Kâzi's sitting openly in the execution of his office, it is added, that there is no impropriety in the Kâzi sitting in his own house to pass judgment, but it is requisite that he give orders for a free access to the people. It then proceeds thus:--"It is requisite that such people sit along with the Kâzi as were used to sit with him, prior to his appointment to the office; because, if he were to sit alone in his house, he would thereby give rise to suspicion."[98] ...|$|E
