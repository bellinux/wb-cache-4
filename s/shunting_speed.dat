50|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{aspiration}} for a capacity of 11,000 goods wagons per day, Maschen was equipped from the beginning with the most modern shunting technology available in the 1970s. The composition of incoming goods trains was transmitted to Maschen before they arrived, so that the hitherto usual practice of handing over the trains in the reception sidings could be done away with. Using the data, train-splitting lists were created, these formed the working basis for the sequence control unit (Ablaufsteuerrechner or ASR). The ASR controls the shunters on the hump yards by radio, giving them the <b>shunting</b> <b>speeds,</b> setting the points for the rolling goods wagons and regulating their speed with retarders, 26 bar-type (Balkengleisbremsen) and 112 rubber retarders being available. 112 wagon transporters (Beidrückanlagen) move the loose wagons onwards within the sidings.|$|R
50|$|On Monday 12 December 1988, {{just outside}} Clapham Junction railway station a crowded train from Basingstoke was <b>shunted</b> at <b>speed</b> from behind by a {{following}} train from Bournemouth, a third train from London on the adjacent line {{collided with the}} wreckage, a fourth train stopped in time. thirty-five people were killed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are simple}} yellow light shunt signals on signal posts which authorize {{movements}} {{to the next}} obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow <b>speed</b> <b>shunt</b> signal indication and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see Hines Hill train collision) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow <b>speed</b> <b>shunt</b> signal, not meant for mainline operations.|$|R
25|$|A diesel–mechanical {{locomotive}} uses {{a mechanical}} transmission {{in a fashion}} similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low <b>speed</b> <b>shunting</b> (switching) locomotives, lightweight multiple units and self-propelled railcars.|$|R
50|$|Ahrens {{retired after}} 1970, taking pride in never {{crashing}} in a race. He {{had suffered a}} high <b>speed</b> <b>shunt</b> in April 1970 while testing a long tail Porsche on a wet Ehra-Lessien, with the car disintegrating badly- the car went under the Armco barrier and broke in half (as they were known to do), leaving Ahrens strapped in the back.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{industrial}} {{shunting locomotive}} design was originated by Neilson and Company of Hyde Park Works, Springburn, Glasgow, {{who built the}} first examples of the type, mainly for industrial customers, in the 1870s. One such, built in 1876, is {{in the collection of}} the Scottish Railway Preservation Society at Bo'ness. The locomotives were designed to operate at low <b>speed,</b> <b>shunting</b> heavy loads, on tight radius sidings and points.|$|R
50|$|The line {{closed in}} 1960 {{as a result}} of declining freight revenues. Another factor was the J15 {{locomotives}} were life expired (steam had largely disappeared from East Anglia by this time) and the route availability of the line was such that only low <b>speed</b> <b>shunting</b> locomotives would be able to realistically operate the line. The time that these locomotives would take to get to Snape would have affected the timetable on the East Suffolk Line so the service was withdrawn instead.|$|R
25|$|In {{areas where}} speeds are lower {{and there are}} a number of routes which can be taken, {{alphanumeric}} (also called theatre-style) route indicators are used to display a number or a letter (e.g. a platform number or line designation) to denote the route the train is to take. They may be located above or beside the relevant signal. When a route is set and the signal is cleared, the relevant letter or number is shown. On <b>shunting</b> signals, where <b>speeds</b> are much lower, a miniature version of the alphanumeric route indicator is used.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on the implementation of switching and sweeping pi-ezoelectric patch vibration absorbers to control the flexural response of a thin rectangular pan-el. The panel is equipped with five piezoelectric patches, which are connected to time-varying RLC-shunts. The inductive and resistive elements of the shunts are varied according to two laws. In the first one, they are iteratively commuted over a given set of values to cyclically control the resonant response of target flexural modes of the panel. In the second one, they are uniformly varied within specific ranges {{in such a way}} as to periodically control the reso-nant response of all flexural modes of the panel resonating in a given frequency band. The shunts include also a negative-capacitive active component, which is used to compensate the capacitive effect of the piezoelectric patches and thus to increase the control effectiveness of the <b>shunts.</b> The <b>speed</b> of the switching events or periodic sweeps are selected {{in such a way as}} the piezoelectric patch vibration absorbers can effectively control the response of the panel. The study shows that both switching and sweeping operation modes reduce the resonance peaks of either the targeted modes or the modes resonating in the target frequency band by values comprised between 3 and 15 dB...|$|R
5000|$|The Bipolars {{operated}} on the Coast Division from 1919 to 1953, {{for most of}} that period without any serious rebuilding. In 1939 they were renumbered E1-E5. In 1953 all five of the EP-2s, which were 35 years old and worn out from heavy wartime service, were heavily rebuilt by the Milwaukee Road {{at a cost of}} about $40,000 per locomotive. The rebuild included additional traction motor <b>shunts</b> for increased <b>speed,</b> roller bearings, multiple unit capability, flash boilers, and streamlining. The E5, rebuilt in the Tacoma Shops as the prototype, performed as advertised, but went over budget, so the Milwaukee Shops were tasked with rebuilding the other four Bipolars. Unfortunately the Milwaukee Shop forces, unaccustomed to working on electric locomotives, did a [...] "poor job" [...] in the opinion of Electrification Department Head Laurence Wylie. (Wylie's successor, T. B. Kirk, stated that he saw a group of disconnected wires in a newly rebuilt EP-2 bundled together and tagged with a written message, [...] "We don't know where these go".) Afterwards the Bipolars were prone to electrical fires and failures, despite repeated attempts by Tacoma Shops to correct them.|$|R
40|$|Unmanned air {{vehicles}} (UAVs) and micro air vehicles (MAVs) constitute unique application platforms for vibration-based energy harvesting. Generating usable {{electrical energy}} during their mission has the important practical value of providing an additional energy source to run small electronic components. Electrical energy can be harvested from aeroelastic vibrations of lifting surfaces of UAVs and MAVs as {{they tend to}} have relatively flexible wings compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, an electromechanically coupled finite element model is combined with an unsteady aerodynamic model to develop a piezoaeroelastic model for airflow excitation of cantilevered plates representing wing-like structures. The electrical power output and the displacement of the wing tip are investigated for several airflow speeds and two different electrode configurations (continuous and segmented). Cancelation of electrical output occurs for typical coupled bending-torsion aeroelastic modes of a cantilevered generator wing when continuous electrodes are used. Torsional motions of the coupled modes become relatively significant when segmented electrodes are used, improving the broadband performance and altering the flutter speed. Although the focus is placed on the electrical power that can be harvested for a given airflow <b>speed,</b> <b>shunt</b> damping effect of piezoelectric power generation is also investigated for both electrode configurations.

40|$|There seems {{little doubt}} that from the {{earliest}} evolutionary beginnings, inhibition has been a fundamental feature of neuronal circuits - even the simplest life forms sense and interact with their environment, orienting or approaching positive stimuli while avoiding aversive stimuli. This requires internal signals that both drive and suppress behavior. Traditional descriptions of inhibition sometimes limit its role to the suppression of action potential generation. This view fails to capture the vast breadth of inhibitory function now known to exist in neural circuits. A modern perspective on inhibitory signaling comprises a multitude of mechanisms. For example, inhibition can act via a <b>shunting</b> mechanism to <b>speed</b> the membrane time constant and reduce synaptic integration time. It can act via G-protein coupled receptors to initiate second messenger cascades that influence synaptic strength. Inhibition contributes to rhythm generation and can even activate ion channels that mediate inward currents to drive action potential generation. Inhibition also appears {{to play a role}} in shaping the properties of neural circuitry over longer time scales. Experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in developing and mature neural circuits underlies behavioral memory and has been intensively studied over the past decade. At excitatory synapses, adjustments of synaptic efficacy are regulated predominantly by changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. There is, however, increasing evidence for inhibitory modulation of target neuron excitability playing key roles in experience-dependent plasticity. One reason for our limited knowledge about plasticity at inhibitory synapses is that in most circuits, neurons receive convergent inputs from disparate sources. This problem can be overcome by investigating inhibitory circuits in a system with well-defined inhibitory nuclei and projections, each with a known computational function. Compared to other sensory systems, the auditory system has evolved a large number of subthalamic nuclei each devoted to processing distinct features of sound stimuli. This information once extracted is then re-assembled to form the percept the acoustic world around us. The well-understood function of many of these auditory nuclei has enhanced our understanding of inhibition's role in shaping their responses from easily distinguished inhibitory inputs. In particular, neurons devoted to processing the location of sound sources receive a complement of discrete inputs for which in vivo activity and function are well understood. Investigation of these areas has led to significant advances in understanding the development, physiology, and mechanistic underpinnings of inhibition that apply broadly to neuroscience. In this series of papers, we provide an authoritative resource for those interested in exploring the variety of inhibitory circuits and their function in auditory processing. We present original research and focused reviews touching on development, plasticity, anatomy, and evolution of inhibitory circuitry. We hope our readers will find these papers valuable and inspirational to their own research endeavors...|$|R
