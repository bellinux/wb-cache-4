Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India.

5|$|Koenig {{first became}} {{involved}} with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if {{he was interested in}} writing for the animated show.

5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E

The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be good}} to start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members would have to do something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E

Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was obligatory, or {{because she had been}} taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes {{to err on the side}} of caution in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E

25|$|Perpetrators Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson {{were arrested}} {{shortly after the}} attack and charged with first degree murder {{following}} Shepard's death. Significant media coverage {{was given to the}} killing and what role Shepard's sexual orientation played as a motive in the commission of the crime. The prosecutor argued that McKinney's murder of Shepard was premeditated and driven by greed. McKinney's defense counsel countered that he had only intended to rob Shepard, but had killed him in a rage when Shepard made a sexual advance towards him. McKinney's girlfriend told police that he had been motivated by anti-gay sentiment, but later recanted her statement, saying that she had lied because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would help him. Both McKinney and Henderson were convicted of the murder and each sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.|$|E
25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, {{it was revealed that}} Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E
25|$|In December 1915 Sewall joined Henry Ford {{and others}} on Ford's Peace Ship, an {{unofficial}} peace expedition aboard the Oscar II in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the war in Europe and bring the American troops home by year's end. Sewall was one of sixty delegates on the trip, which left Hoboken, New Jersey, bound for Norway, on December 4. Sewall hoped the effort would gain public attention to the cause for peace and strengthen the peace movement's resolve, but it received a mixed reaction from the press. After traveling through Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands, the group concluded their trip and departed for the United States in January 1916. Although some argued the trip served a useful purpose by bringing together idealists and journalists to help popularize the peace movement, others considered it a failure. Sewell was more optimistic; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> helped advance the hope for lasting peace. Following her return to the United States, Sewell toured the public lecture circuit, but soon disappeared from public life, possibly for health reasons (she was seventy-two) or was embarrassed by the trip's outcome, and turned to other pursuits.|$|E

500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent {{particularly}} praised Smith, {{stating that}} he [...] "excels in his acting, managing to be reassuring and threatening, hilarious and sinister all {{within the same}} few scenes".

Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern thought that there were [...] "points of logic" [...] which might be questioned, but they were [...] "minor points to wrestle with in a largely polished production". Keith Phipps, reviewing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B and called it a [...] "pretty good follow-up".|$|E
