The current problem is the high cost of such machines on the market hence most SMEs in a developing economy cannot afford them. Through careful analysis of current machines, use of alternative cheaper materials and use of more energy efficient drive mechanisms, it was possible {{to come up with a}} low cost and efficient solution. Research on the paper slitting and rewinding industry was conducted on the internet, published scholarly articles and industrial visits to local companies in the same business. The implementation of this design has major positive benefits to the development of the economy...|$|E

5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log <b>slitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>rewind</b> <b>slitting.</b> In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For <b>rewind</b> slitting the <b>machine</b> used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, <b>and</b> then the <b>rewind</b> may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the <b>slit</b> width <b>and</b> the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|R
40|$|All {{converting}} lines <b>and</b> slitter <b>rewinding</b> operations {{require an}} unwinding system. Typically the unwinding {{system is the}} Rodney Dangerfield on a line or slitter rewinder. The <b>slitting</b> system <b>and</b> the winding system are considered with great importance but the unwinding system does not get the respect it deserves. Although often considered a simple function, {{the selection of a}} proper unwinding system is extremely important to the overall productivity of the converting or <b>slitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>rewinding</b> operation. This paper is a Practical Guide for selecting the right unwind and related equipment to best match the unwinding system’s Cost verses Efficiency to ensure the maximum performance and productivity from a converting line and/or slitter rewinder. Design Criteria- The first thing that must be established is the basic design criteria. This basic design criteria will help select the design of unwind best suited for the application. The variation of these parameters dictate the flexibility required, and therefore the complexity and cost of the system. The following must be determined: 1. Materials to be processed: Types- composites, extensible, non-extensible Basis weight range Thickness range for each material and basis weight 2. Roll diameters and weights 3. Speed of operation 4. Tension- Tensile strength of materials 5. Core materials and sizes: Length variations Inside diameter and tolerances Outside diameters 6. Roll delivery systems The old rule “jack of all trades and master of none ” applies to the unwind operation so be realistic when specifying the required range for best value and performance of the unwinding system. Frame Construction – A major factor in an unwinds cost is the material and construction of the framing. The frame construction for unwind stands on typical converting lines and slitter rewinders can range from machine mounted plate steel for lower speed and light weight roll...|$|R

5000|$|When {{the term}} [...] "slitter rewinder" [...] or [...] "slitting machine" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the machine, the three parts are referred to as the unwind, the <b>slitting</b> section <b>and</b> the <b>rewind.</b> Slitter rewinders are normally used to slit plastic films, paper and metal foils. The unwind stage holds the roll stably and allows it to spin; it is either braked or driven to maintain accurate tension in the material. Some machines have a driven unwind which reduces the effect of inertia when starting to unwind heavy rolls or when the material is very tension-sensitive.|$|R

Surakarta: Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, Juli 2007. PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa {{is one of}} {{the company}} in a {{metallizing}} industry. The most often material handling equipment using by production division is handlifter. It can be seen at frequency usage of highest material handling appliance for the handlifter. The prime situation from material handling problems, early from less fluent of material intake in floor and in rewindingslitting machine. This matter because of handlifter cannot conducting of material intake which is in form of coil at location in floor <b>and</b> in <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine</b> directly. Other problem at the of conducting of material intake that is in <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine,</b> operator have to use appliance assist. At material intake in floor also there are additional constraint, besides operator have to use the appliance assist, the operator also have to push material to part of lifter. The aim of this research is to overcome constraint that occured in process of material intake using assist previous handling material, so that process material handling can more productive [...] The method is being used in is anthropometry approach. Anthropometry approach is needed to to determine material handling appliance dimension. This research also assess productivity from material handling appliance, use result from material handling simulation model. Simulation model meant as information from material handling condition after conducted redesigning. This research is conducted at material handling operator in PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa counted 6 people. The result of this research indicate that redesigning material handling appliance assist by using anthropometry approach can reduce processing time become 48. 873, 6 second. Besides that also make improve an productivity index value, that is for the index of material productivity occured improvement equal to 22...|$|R
