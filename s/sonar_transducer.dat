5000|$|Sonar {{systems are}} {{generally}} used underwater for range finding and detection. Active sonar emits an acoustic signal, or pulse of sound, into the water.

But passive sonar cannot measure the range of an object unless it is {{used in conjunction with}} other passive listening devices. Multiple passive sonar devices must be used for triangulation of a sound source. No matter whether active sonar or passive sonar, the information included in the reflected signal can not be used without technical signal processing.

25|$|Active sonar is {{also used}} to measure {{distance}} through water between two <b>sonar</b> <b>transducers</b> or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|R
