25|$|Jews from Upper Nazareth, {{including}} apparently many Russian-speakers, attacked Arabs {{and their}} homes and businesses in Nazareth {{on the eve of}} Yom Kippur. Police, informed of the intention to attack Arabs, beefed up their forces and deployed them on the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> between the two communities. When hundreds of Jewish youths from Nazareth Illit came down to throw stones and vandalize Arab properties, however, the police did not impede them. The Arab residents emerged from their homes to defend them, and reciprocal stone throwing clashes ensued. Police dispersed the riots with tear gas and live ammunition. Two Arabs who had attempted to rein in their own communities from getting near the Jewish youths and police, Omar Akawi and Wissam Yazbek, were shot dead, the latter by a gunshot wound to the head, fired by a policeman from behind him. The shooters were never identified.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pillow is an {{interactive}} pattern-design system for creating plush toys. The user imports a 3 D surface model {{into the system}} and specifies the segmentation boundaries interactively by drawing <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> on the model surface. Based on this segmentation, the system generates a 2 D pattern by flattening each outlined region, and then visualizes {{the shape of the}} resulting plush toy by applying a simple physics simulation. If the result is not satisfactory, the user can make different <b>seam</b> <b>lines.</b> This closed-loop framework allows users to experiment with various seam patterns before actually working on real fabric to obtain the best-looking result. The system also estimates total sewing time based on the total length of the <b>seam</b> <b>lines.</b> We implemented the system to produce plush toys and a balloon. ...|$|R

50|$|Image {{blending}} involves {{executing the}} adjustments figured {{out in the}} calibration stage, combined with remapping of the images to an output projection. Colors are adjusted between images to compensate for exposure differences. If applicable, high dynamic range merging is done along with motion compensation and deghosting. Images are blended together and <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> adjustment is done to minimize the visibility of seams between images.|$|E

50|$|Nylon {{stockings}} {{became increasingly}} popular {{on the black}} market, and sold for up to $20 per pair. Women who could not {{get their hands on}} nylons resorted to lotions, creams, stick cakes and painting <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> down their legs to give the illusion of nylons. Because nylon stockings were so widely sought-after, they also became the target of crime. In Louisiana, one household was robbed of 18 pairs of nylons. Similarly, robbery was ruled out as the motive of a murder in Chicago because the nylons were untouched.|$|R

50|$|Vinyl siding is also {{considered}} one of the more unattractive siding choices by many. Although some newer styles eliminate this complaint, more widespread varieties often have visible <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> between panels and generally do not have the quality appearance of wood, brick, or masonry. The fading and cracking of older types of plastic siding compound this issue. In many areas of newer housing development, particularly in North America, entire neighbourhoods are often built with all houses clad in vinyl siding, given an unappealing uniformity. Some cities now campaign for house developers to incorporate varied types of siding during construction.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to bonding surfaces together, hot-melt glue {{can be used}} to fill gaps, but the properties that allow gap-filling (high viscosity, high toughness, and so on) keep it from forming an adhesive film as thin and smooth as is possible with other adhesives. (For example, a wood joint properly made with hide glue may be invisible, marked only by a difference in grain at the <b>seam</b> <b>line.)</b> Bonds must be made quickly before the glue has time to harden. Usually it must be applied accurately with the glue gun, as it can not easily be spread, but it is always possible at any time to melt and spread the glue with a heat gun or a household clothes iron, which helps when bonding larger areas.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} of El'ad {{started in the}} late 1990s, following a government decision in 1990 to build a series of settlements along the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> with the West Bank under then-housing minister Ariel Sharon, and provide immediate housing for 50,000 residents. The town was built from scratch as a planned community according to urban planning paradigms not unlike Modi'in and nearby Shoham. While those towns were designed to suit a mixed population of non-religious and religious Jews, El'ad was originally planned to suit a mixed population of Modern Orthodox/Religious Zionist Jews and ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews, offering {{a solution to the}} acute shortage of affordable housing for Haredi families. The majority of the population are Haredi Jews. Accordingly, El'ad is built in a way that suits their religious lifestyle, with a larger selection of housing options offering larger than average apartments to accommodate religious families, who tend to have more children than the average national population. Another characteristic is easy access and short walking distances to local education institutions to avoid the need for school transportation costs.|$|E
50|$|Shaped facings are cut {{to match}} the outside shape of the piece to provide a neat finish, and are often cut from the same pattern pieces. Shaped facings are {{typically}} made of the same fabric as the garment, but may also be made of lighter-weight fabric or in a contrasting color as a design element. Extended facings are extensions of the garment fabric, folded back and usually stabilized. Bias facings are strips of lightweight fabric cut on the true bias (US) or cross-grain (UK), and shaped rather than cut {{to match the}} edge {{to which they are}} applied.After sewing the structural seam of a facing, it must also be under-stitched to prevent it rolling to the outside. Under-stitching is done close to the <b>seam</b> <b>line,</b> attaching the facing to the seam allowance. A facing can also be used decoratively by applying it from the inside, allowing it to be turned to the outside as a contrasting piece. An all-in-one facing is used to finish the armhole and neckline of a garment together, all at once. Interfacing, grading and clipping the seams are all terms closely associated with facing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — TwinFaces, a new {{technique}} for the automatic generation of facial textures is presented in this paper. Multiple views from the individual, taken under moderately controlled illumination conditions, are combined to create the seamless texture using a wavelet-based technique. Since the method relies {{on a set of}} particular feature points of the MPEG- 4 Facial and Body Animation (FBA) standard, it can be easily integrated with applications using the same standard. A post-processing technique for pictures taken outdoors has been also integrated into TwinFaces to compensate for non-uniform illumination conditions. The wavelet-based approach has shown to be more flexible than previous approaches to remove the artificial <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> produced by the blending of the different views involved in the texture generation.

The presented algorithm is based on the identification induced by the correlation and the direction of tie points. Tie points were selected from two geometrically distored spatial ortho-images. And the identification of selected tie points were represented by FOM. Additionally, four factors were taken into account for weights of the directed graph. These five factors were adjusted finely to work equally on selecting <b>seam</b> <b>line.</b> Then, the Dijkstra algorithm was executed repeatedly after each line adjustment.

40|$|A {{sub-block}} {{algorithm is}} usually {{applied in the}} super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of images because of limitations in computer memory. However, the sub-block SR images can hardly achieve a seamless image mosaicking because of the uneven distribution of brightness and contrast among these sub-blocks. An effectively improved weighted Wallis dodging algorithm is proposed, aiming at the characteristic that SR reconstructed images are gray images with {{the same size and}} overlapping region. This algorithm can achieve consistency of image brightness and contrast. Meanwhile, a weighted adjustment sequence is presented to avoid the spatial propagation and accumulation of errors and the loss of image information caused by excessive computation. A <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> elimination method can share the partial dislocation in the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> to the entire overlapping region with a smooth transition effect. Subsequently, the improved method is employed to remove the uneven illumination for 900 SR reconstructed images of ZY- 3. Then, the overlapping image mosaic method is adopted to accomplish a seamless image mosaic based on the optimal <b>seam</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
