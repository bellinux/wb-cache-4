40|$|The notch {{sensitivity}} of aliphatic polyketone (PK) terpolymers {{was investigated in}} this article. The notch-tip radius was varied between {{the size of an}} actual propagating crack tip of 1 - 2 m and the largest notch tip of 1000 m radius. The larger notch-tip radii (1000 - 15 m) were milled into the polymer. The smallest notch-tip radii of 2 and 15 microns were made with a novel technique with the aid of an Eximer laser. The fracture behavior of the PK-terpolymer was found to be sensitive toward changes in notch-tip radius. The fracture energy decreased strongly with decreasing notch-tip radius even when fractured ductile. <b>Sharper</b> <b>notches</b> were not as effectively blunted as were larger notches in the ductile region. The brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (Tbd) was increased with decreasing notch-tip radius for the larger notches (1000 - 100 m). For <b>sharper</b> <b>notches</b> (2 and 15 m) the Tbd decreased again. This behavior could be explained by the decreasing amount of elastic energy release with <b>sharper</b> <b>notches.</b> The energy release proved to be very important for this material. A mixed-mode fracture behavior was found to occur with larger notches because of the elastic energy present in the sample before fracture. The {{notch sensitivity}} was reduced considerably by the addition of a 10 % core-shell rubber phase. For the blend material the notch-tip radius had almost no influence on the Tbd.
