40|$|Studies of the {{metabolism}} {{and distribution of}} lung surfactant are aided by use of radiolabeled surfactant or surfactant components. These studies have often made use of [3 H]- or [14 C]phosphatidylcholine. Analysis of the lung content of surfactant containing these beta-emitting labels usually requires tissue digestion, use of <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluids,</b> and significant correction for quenching of photon production. Because use of a gamma-emitting isotope would obviate these requirements, we have investigated the use of 3 -(trifluoromethyl) - 3 -(m-[125 I]iodophenyl) diazirine ([125 I]TID), a lipophilic photoactivatable compound, to radiolabel pulmonary surfactant. Our results indicate that, during photoactivation, products of [125 I]TID are produced that result in radiolabeling of both the lipid and protein components of extracted porcine surfactant. Separation of radiolabeled surfactant from hydrophobic nonlabelling photolysis products was accomplished by gel chromatography. Exposure of surfactant (34 mumol/ml) to [125 I]TID under labeling conditions resulted in incorporation of 45. 3 +/- 5. 1 % of the radiolabel. Incorporation of radiolabel in the various phospholipids of lung surfactant was approximately equivalent. Lipophilic surfactant apoproteins were also radiolabeled.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of ³H and 14 C in research has generated a large volume of waste mixed with scintillation liquid, requiring an effective control and appropriate storage of liquid radioactive waste. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of three commercially available scintillation liquids, Optiphase HiSafe 3, Ultima-Gold AB (biodegradable) and Insta-Gel-XF (non-biodegradable), in terms of [14 C]-glucose and [³H]-thymidine counting efficiency. We also analyzed {{the effect of the}} relative amount of water (1. 6 to 50 %), radioisotope concentration (0. 1 to 100 nCi/ml), pH (2 to 10) and color of the solutions (samples containing 0. 1 to 1. 0 mg/ml of Trypan blue) on the counting efficiency in the presence of these scintillation liquids. There were few significant differences in the efficiency of 14 C and ³H counting obtained with biodegradable or non-biodegradable scintillation liquids. However, there was an 83 and 94 % reduction in the efficiency of 14 C and ³H counting, respectively, in samples colored with 1 mg/ml Trypan blue, but not with 0. 1 mg/ml, independent of the scintillation liquid used. Considering the low cost of biodegradable scintillation cocktails and their efficacy, these results show that traditional hazardous <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluids</b> may be replaced with the new safe biodegradable fluids without impairment of ³H and 14 C counting efficiency. The use of biodegradable scintillation cocktails minimizes both human and environmental exposure to hazardous solvents.

After passing through a mixer, the mixture was passed through a hol-low-tube flow cell mounted in a liquid scintillation spec-trometer. Because the added spacer acts like a contin-uous series of pistons, it unifies flow rate at center and walls of the conduit and so decreases sample carry-over. This system was applied to measurement of radio-activity in the effluent of a high-speed amino acid ana-lyzer, in which some amino acids emerge at 30 -s inter-vals.

In this study, the development of C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation in soil co-contaminated with aged or freshly added Al or Fe amendment was assessed. C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation was assessed using respirometry; respirometers incorporated a Teflon-lined screw-capped CO 2 trap containing 1 -M NaOH within a glass scintillation vial. The production of (CO 2) -C- 14 was assessed {{by the addition of}} Ultima Gold liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> to the CO 2 traps and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. Enumeration of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria was achieved by counting the colony forming unit count using the spread plate method. This investigation considered the effects of Al and Fe (50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg) on C- 14 -phenanthrene biodegradation in soil over 63 -day contact time. Fresh Al amendments at lower concentrations (50 and 100 mg/kg) stimulated phenanthrene catabolism (p < 0. 05) at t = 21 and 42 days which may reflect an 'Arndt-Schulz' effect, but phenanthrene catabolism was significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) in 500 mg/kg aged Al this could be due to Al toxicity to phenanthrene degraders. Phenanthrene mineralisation was stimulated in the highest Fe concentration (500 mg/kg) in aged and fresh Fe amendments at t = 21 days. This could be because Fe is an essential requirement for microbial growth. The impact of Al or Fe on the catabolism of C- 14 -phenanthrene was dependent on incubation time and Al was more toxic than Fe to soil PAH catabolic activity. This could be because Al is a non-essential microbial requirement. Bioremediation of soils co-contaminated with PAH and heavy metal is a complex problem; therefore, studies on the impact of metals on PAHs biodegradation highlight the risks and biodegradation potential in contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the pharmacokinetics of meta(tetrahydroxyphenyl) chlorin (mTHPC) on different tissues of interest in a hamster tumour model and to confirm our earlier animal studies on semi-quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The results obtained by three different evaluation methods were compared: in vivo spectrofluorometry, ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and chemical extraction of 14 C-labelled mTHPC. Following intracardiac injection of 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 mTHPC, groups of five tumour-bearing animals were used for in situ light-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Afterwards, the biopsies were taken and snap frozen for fluorescence microscopy. The presence of radioactivity in serum and tissues was determined after chemical digestion in <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> using a scintillation counter. For each analysed tissue, a good correlation was observed between the three evaluation methods. The highest fluorescence intensity and quantities of mTHPC were observed between 12 and 24 [*]h in liver, kidney, serum, vascular endothelium and advanced neoplasia. The majority of mTHPC was found at around 48 [*]h in smooth muscle and at 96 [*]h in healthy cheek pouch mucosa and early malignant lesions. The lowest level of mTHPC was noted in striated muscle at all times. No selectivity in dye localisation was observed between early squamous cell carcinoma and healthy mucosa. Soon after the injection, a significant selectivity was noted for advanced squamous cell carcinoma as compared to healthy cheek pouch mucosa or striated muscle. A significant difference in mTHPC localisation and quantity was also observed between striated and smooth muscle during the first 48 [*]h following the injection. Finally, this study demonstrated the usefulness of non-invasive in situ spectroscopic measurements to be performed systematically prior to photodynamic therapy as a real-time monitoring for each treated patient in order to individualise and adapt the light dosimetry and avoid over or under treatments...|$|E
40|$|In beta-scintillation detection, {{interference}} {{within the}} <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> decreases the apparent {{activity of the}} sam plc. Chemical interference with scintillation emission (chemi cal quench) and optical absorption of scintillation (optical quench) decrease the efficiency of counting. To measure the radioactivity in a liquid-scintillation experiment accurately, corrections must {{be made for the}} quenching present. A shift in the pulse-height spectrum of a beta-emitter causes a change in the integral counting efficiency of a liquid scintillation sample (I). By comparing the ratio of high and low-energy measurements with known amounts of quench, an index of counting efficiency can be made (2). Calibration curves obtained by this â€œchannelsratioâ€•method are independent of the quenching medium for â€˜Hand â€œC over most counting ranges (1, 3). Usually the counting efficiency is relatively constant within any set of experiments. However, variations among samples or the presence of colored pigments (such as carotene or bilirubin) may introduce substantial counting error. Thus, quench correction should be employed in every beta-scintillation experiment (2). We have found that the channel A/B ratios obtained from quench standards fall along a second-order polynomial curve described by the general formula ax 2 + bx + c = where x is the A/B ratio and y is the efficiency. Standard second-order polynomial regression may be carried out on channel A/B ratios found for standard samples, thus yield ing the coefficients for this polynomial. The A/B ratios for â€˜Hand â€œCstandards, using a Searle liquid-scintillation counter, are shown in Fig. I. These experimental values for A/B and efficiency are fitted by the corresponding poly nomial curves for â€˜Hand â€œC. The correlation coefficient is 0. 996 for tritium and 0. 997 for carbon-l 4. This suggests excellent agreement between the measured values and the polynomial expression. However, A/B ratios above 0. 9 and below 0. 1 are not well defined by this experiment and should not be substituted into the polynomial to calculate efficiency.

40|$|Resistance to {{antibiotics}} by microbial pathogens {{continues to}} be a major global health problem. Treatment of bacterial infections is becoming increasingly complex and expensive. Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, is affected by antibiotic resistance. In South Africa, the Western Province is the worst affected, with an increasing incidence of both multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. Both resistant forms of TB increase the length of treatment to almost 24 months and cost by as much as 1400 times that of regular anti-tubercular chemotherapy. A potential solution to this problem is the discovery of new drugs, which can be obtained from natural sources. Actinomycetes are good sources of these drugs, with over 45 % of current medicines derived from these bacteria. The actinobacterium Streptomyces polyantibioticus SPRT (SPRT) was locally isolated and first described by Le Roes (2006). It has been shown to produce bioactive molecules active against a range of bacteria, including compounds (drugs) that have anti-tubercular properties. One of the anti-tubercular molecules was identified as 2, 5 -diphenyloxazole (DPO). DPO is currently used as a component of <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> for its luminescent properties and is synthesised chemically in industry. SPRT is the only reported biological source of DPO, it is however not yet produced commercially via a biological route. The present study was performed to inform future process development of DPO production from SPRT. An investigation into the growth and production of antimicrobial compounds from submerged cultures of SPRT in shake flasks, and scale-up of the process into a laboratory stirred tank bioreactor (STR) was done in the present study. The work focused on obtaining growth kinetics and suitable operating conditions for cultivation. Characterisation of the growth profile of SPRT and determination of the kinetic growth parameters was carried out. Additionally, the antimicrobial production phases, and factors influencing their production was investigated. It was determined that the most reliable method of measuring biomass concentration was by dry cell gravimetric measurement of whole shake flasks following vacuum filtration, as it best suited the non-homogenous filamentous nature of SPRT...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a known {{stimulator}} of glucose transport. IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP 1) is {{a protein}} that regulates {{the actions of}} IGF-I by binding to IGF-I which alters it's ability to bind to the IGF-I receptor. Diet and exercise may influence this system. While IGFBP 1 levels increase with fasting or prolonged exercise, feeding will reverse this elevation. The intent {{of this study was}} to determine if an in vivo manipulation of IGFBP 1 affects in vitro glucose transport in the rat soleus. Sixteen male Spaque Dawley rats were fasted for 12 hours. Half of the animals were then allowed a two hour ad libitum refeeding period. Animals were anesthetized and had their soleus muscles removed. Muscles were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Treatments involved an incubation in either 4 or 8 mM glucose in either the presence or absence of IGF-I (75 ng x ml"'). Final incubation for all treatment groups included [3 H]- 3 -O-methylglucose (437 µCi x mM-) for the measurement of glucose transport. Following incubation, muscles were weighed, homogenized in 1 ml of 10 % trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged to precipitate out protein. 100 µl of the supernatant was added to 3 ml of <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> and analyzed in a scintillation counter. Glucose transport was determined by 3 H activity. A statistical analysis of the various groups shows that there is no significant difference between fasted and refed animal for any specific treatment. However, when all the fasted and refed animals area grouped, glucose transport rate is significantly greater (p< 0. 05) in fasted (3. 59 ± 0. 44 µM x ml"' x hr) animals than in refed animals (2. 56 ± 0. 27 µM x ml"' x hr'). Additionally, muscles that were treated with IGF-I in 8 mM glucose demonstrated a greater rate of glucose transport (5. 12 ± 0. 68 µM x ml- 1 x hr') than all other treatments (2. 13 ± 0. 39 to 2. 90 ±. 33 µM x ml-' x hr'). This study showed that IGF-I is a stimulator of glucose transport in an 8 mM glucose media. Additionally, the results show that glucose transport is greater if the animals are fasted. The differences between fasted and refed animals demonstrated in this study supports the hypothesis that diet manipulated IGFBP 1 levels are able to alter the biological effects of IGF-I.

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{approach was}} used to engineer a range of nanostructured surfaces with specificities {{for a number of}} radioactive waste contaminants that are typical of low level legacy contamination at sites across the UK. Specifically, analytes 238 / 234 UO 22 +, 90 Sr 2 + and 137 Cs+. Because traditional mercury based electrochemical methods lacked the specificity to differentiate individual analytes from complex solutions, combining electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with receptor molecules of desired specificity {{was used to}} create sensors with specificity and sensitivity to these radionuclides and which could give responses in real time. For UO 22 +, combining the evolved uranyl sequestering ability of the surface layer protein (SLP) from the bacterial strain Bacillus sphaericus JG-A 12 allowed sub nanomolar levels of uranyl to be monitored in real time using the capacitative component of impedance at low frequency, whilst being largely selective against contaminant divalent cations. Whilst this approach, based on two tethering mechanisms for the SLP, has potential for fabrication of bespoke biosensors for other metal analytes, {{because of the lack of}} available metal binding proteins with appropriate cation specificity, alternative synthetic hosts were investigated as receptors. A number of macrocycles, including crown ethers and lariat ethers with specificity to either 90 Sr 2 + or 137 Cs+ were obtained commercially and chemically modified, or chemically synthesised, to permit surface tethering to sensor electrodes. Combining these tethered synthetic hosts with real time cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and microgravimetric interrogation methods revealed some interesting interfacial phenomena and gave insight into host interactions with the electrode surface. However, this approach did not yield devices that could be used to empirically quantify binding 90 Sr 2 + or 137 Cs+. Accordingly, an alternative approach of combining engineered surfaces that had high surface areas and metal ion specificity, with direct quantification of analyte by  or  counting of the captured radionuclide was investigated using  counting for 90 Sr 2 + and counting for 137 Cs+. This allowed differentiation and quantification of 90 Sr 2 + or 137 Cs+ ions from their non-radioactive isotopes which exist naturally and abundantly in the environment. Functionalised silanes allowed metal chelator functionality to be deposited onto bulk silica surfaces, polymeric nanofibres and silica nano – and micro- particles. Whilst the bulk surfaces and nanofibres were able to bind significant amounts of isotopes, at very low level analyte concentrations typical of contaminated ground water, reproducibility between batches was poor. However, the functionalised nanoparticles performed well, binding significant amounts of radionculide and exhibiting high saturation limits. They were also were able to bind low levels of radionculide in complex analyte solutions such as synthetic groundwater. Bifunctional chelators particles were also made which allowed simultaneous deposition of a solid scintillant. This allowed simultaneous binding and quantification of radioisotopes without the need of <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> for counting of -particles from 90 Sr 2 +...|$|E
40|$|Author: David R. Caprette ### Generation of a Light Curve To {{address the}} {{hypothesis}} concerning photosynthetic efficiency {{it is necessary}} to expose sun and shade leaves to a range of light intensities long enough for them to fix significant amounts of carbon. It is necessary to expose identical surface areas under favorable conditions which are identical for all leaves except for light intensity (the experimental variable). A means of measuring the rate of carbon fixation is also necessary, of course. Read over the recommended procedure for [carbon- 14 labeling of leaf disks]([URL] in which leaves are exposed to different light intensities in an atmosphere rich in the radioisotope carbon- 14. Under favorable conditions, all newly-fixed carbon will include a proportion of labeled (radioactive) carbon. By measuring the amount of radioactivity in each disk, one can determine the amount of carbon fixed by each leaf. After labeling the leaf disks, they must be extracted {{in order to make the}} new carbon compounds soluble. That way they can be assayed by liquid scintillation counting. Read over the [extraction procedure]([URL] and peruse the articles on [detection of radioactivity]([URL] ### Carbon- 14 Labeling of Leaf Disks **Objectives** This experiment will involve potentially hazardous substances and procedures. It is essential to be familiar with principles of laboratory safety before attempting this sort of procedure. Before working with radioisotopes, make sure you understand the basics of radioisotopes and their detection. Specific hazards will be pointed out at various points in the procedural outline. In order to generate a light curve, you will expose leaf disks to various levels of light in the presence of radioactively-labeled carbon dioxide (carbon- 14). Disks will be illuminated for 30 min., with some disks kept in the dark as controls. The rate at which a disk accumulates reduced carbon- 14 in its tissues is proportional to its rate of photosynthesis, provided the rate of metabolism is relatively low. Therefore, total radioactivity will be counted for each disk. You know the time period of light exposure, the amount of radioactivity added to each incubation chamber, and you can calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in each chamber. Therefore you can determine the rate of carbon fixation in molecules of carbon fixed per unit time. In the classroom you should work in pairs, however you will need data from the entire class to obtain significant results (replicate samples). Therefore you will have to organize and coordinate your work with other groups. You and your lab partner will be given a group number and a set of light levels. One or two other pairs will have the same group number. You and the other members of your group will share the same chambers for incubation of samples, and should start your incubations at the same time. **Chamber preparation** A 12 well cell culture dish (12 well cluster) makes an appropriate light exposure chamber. The lid is clear, and the interior is designed to maximum gas exchange among the wells. The inside edge of the lid can be lined with wax to make a gas tight seal, and prevent loss of label. Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) may be used as well. Using cell culture dishes, plan to place no more than one leaf disk in any well, and reserve a central well for the radioactive solution. The lid will have a hole in it over the well that will receive label. Label as many pieces of Whatman # 1 filter paper as you will have specimens of leaves. Wet the pieces with distilled water and place them in appropriate positions in the chamber(s) as instructed. The paper should be completely damp, but there should be no excess water in the dish. The purpose of the water is to provide a humid atmosphere to prevent dessication of the leaf disks, which can no longer replace water lost to transpiration. Prepare the chamber lid by lining the inside edge with wax, but don't seal it yet. Don't smear up the clear lid - that would interfere with the entry of light into the chamber. Use a paper punch and forceps to remove leaf disks from a single sun leaf, avoiding large veins (why?). Place one or more disks in the chamber(s) on the moist paper in appropriate positions. Your instructor will advise you as to how many duplicate disks to use per chamber. Repeat for a shade leaf. The disks should be placed with the cuticle (top surface) up. Try to keep the disk from flipping over prior to and during exposure to light. If a disk should flip over after sealing the lid, make a note of it. That may or may not make a difference. Seal the chamber(s). **Exposure to light and carbon- 14 ** Place your chamber(s) underneath the light source (turned off for now). Clear the immediate area of any books, pencils, or anything other than your chamber materials. Always use bench paper and keep unnecessary objects away from any radioisotope experiment in case of a spill. Once your dishes are prepared and in position you are ready for the radioacitve material. EXCEPTION: If natural sunlight is used, the chambers must be charged (label added) in a dim area, and then transported in the dark to the outside. Timing of exposure would then begin the moment they were exposed to light. One person should be designated to handle the dishes for your group, and must put on gloves and a lab coat. Steps that involve handling of radioactive chambers are to be carried out by that person only (under your supervision, of course). Obtain a syringe with 1 N citric acid. An instructor will add carbon- 14 labeled sodium bicarbonate to each chamber. Record the amount added and the specific activity, as you may need to quantify the amount of labeled carbon later. The solution is at a high pH which reduces, but does not completely inhibit, exchange of bicarbonate anion with atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Some radioactive carbon will be released into the atmosphere even before adding acid, so work efficiently. In an aqueous solution, NaHCO 3 reaches equilibrium with atmospheric CO 2. (1) Under normal conditions NaHCO 3 dissociates to [Na+] + [HCO 3 -], and H 2 O dissociates to [H+] + [OH-]. (2) [Na+] + [OH-] is, simply, ionized NaOH. (3) [H+] + [HCO 3 -] combine to form H 2 O + dissolved CO 2. (4) Dissolved CO 2 is exchanged with atmospheric CO 2 by diffusion. All of the dissociations are reversible, and are influenced by pH. Use the syringe to add about 5 drops of citric acid to the radioactive liquid, and immediately note the time. Immediately after the addition of acid, gently cover the opening with a bead of wax, being careful not to crack the lid. The acid favors the dissociation of the bicarbonate anion into water and carbon dioxide, thus shifting equation (3) to the right. This way, the radioactive carbon becomes a part of the atmospheric pool of CO 2. Expose the chamber(s) to light, and begin timing immediately. In the laboratory you can simply turn on a switch and expose them all simultaneously. Light intensity should be recorded using an appropriate meter as microeinsteins per m 2 per sec. The einstein is appropriate because it is defined as the energy of one mole of photons of light of 700 nanometers (nm) wavelength. **Terminating the exposure** After a specific illumination period interrupt the light exposure, putting all chambers under a dark cloth for 10 min. Incubation in the dark permits the mechanisms involved in the "dark" reactions to complete the process of light-dependent carbon fixation, while still in a labeled CO 2 atmosphore. Put on gloves and lab coat and add 10 drops of 5 N KOH to the radioactive liquid. NOTE: read over the [safety tip]([URL] in the leaf extraction protocol about strong bases. The strong base dramatically reduces the rate of exchange of dissolved CO 2 with bicarbonate anion. Working over bench paper, open each chamber and use forceps to put each disk into a scintillation vial, previously labeled with a very small numeral and initial near the top of the vial. Radioactivity in the vials will be estimated by scintillation counting, which requires the recording of flashes of light. Large marks on the vials would interfere with the detection of light. Each individual should now work with one or more vials, each containing a 'hot' leaf disk. Clean up the chambers. ### Extraction of C- 14 Labeled Leaf Tissue Plant tissues should be placed in a clear screw-capped tube, such as a scintillation counting vial. All extraction procedures should be carried out within the vial, both to prevent contamination of benches and equipment as well as to retain all of the carbon- 14 activity. Both the cap and the vial should be clearly labeled. Vials must be marked near the shoulder so as not to interfere with scintillation counting later. For comparison of samples, all samples must be of the same surface area, since surface area defines the amount of incident light during the exposure. Usually, disks must be punched out of larger size leaf fragments, so that only healthy tissue is assessed for carbon fixation rate. **Tissue preparation** Wearing gloves and working over a piece of bench paper, the leaf tissue should be minced into fine pieces with scissors. No piece should be larger than 0. 5 mm in any dimension. Mincing is best accomplished by keeping the scissor tips inside the vial and mincing the material in place. The scissor tips must be cleaned off with forceps and all pieces recovered, and the tips wiped off with a lab wiper between samples. All of the pieces must remain in the bottom of the vial for the count to be representative of the sample. With caps on but loose, the vials should be placed in a plastic beaker to prevent their falling over, and dried at 70 to 100 degrees C or under a heat lamp for 15 min. The reduced carbon, incorporated into sugar molecules, must be extracted from the leaf tissue tobe dissolved in counting fluid for the measurement of radioactivity. Drying the tissue facilitates the extraction. **Extraction with nitric acid** Open vials must be handled with extreme care, because when the pieces dry they accumulate static charge, and may 'jump' out of the vial when disturbed. After allowing the vials to cool, 30 microliters nitric acid should be added to each vial, and the vials capped securely. Nitric acid is nasty, and is very efficient at destroying clothing, so it should be pipetted in the fume hood with the window at the lowest comfortable working position, so there is always glass between the investigator and the acid. After placing the vials in a 70 degree (C) water bath, they should be removed at one minute intervals and votexed at high speed to expedite the extraction. Total extraction time is arbitrary, but five minutes is usually sufficient. **Safety tip - hazards of strong bases** You are probably well aware that strong acids are dangerous. The fact that they cause extreme skin irritation and sting if they get in your eyes is incentive enough to wear protective clothing and glasses. However strong bases, such as KOH or drain-cleaning solutions which are NaOH-based, are much more dangerous. They anesthetize nerve endings so that one does not feel the damage, even when the stuff gets in one's eyes. If you even think you might have come into contact with such solutions, rinse the affected area thoroughly. In the case of eye contamination, rinse with cold running water for a full 20 minutes. **Preparation for liquid scintillation counting** After allowing the vials to cool., 5 ml of <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> should be added (for 7 ml vials), using a repipet. After tightly capping the vials they should be vortexed thoroughly once more taken to the scintillation counter or vial rack, logged in and loaded up. Most counters continue to count samples while loading. Each vial may require as much as 10 minutes for an accurate count, so the raw data will be available the following day or later. **Safety tip - hazards of scintillation fluid** <b>Scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> is volatile and may be carcinogenic. Always use a fume hood when working with <b>scintillation</b> <b>fluid</b> or any organic solvent, and work behind the glass shield. The scintillation "cocktail", as it is called, is usually delivered by means of a repipet. The repipet should be calibrated to deliver 5 - 6 ml for a 7 ml vial, or about 15 ml for a 20 ml vial. Biodegradable scintillation cocktail is available. If the type and amount of isotope allows sink disposal under state regulations, the material can be flushed down the sink with plenty of tap water, with no harm to the environment. Since carbon- 14 is a naturally-occurring radioisotope and is not highly hazardous, this method of disposable should be acceptable...|$|E
