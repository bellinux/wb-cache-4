The analysis shows that sophisticated combinations of harmonised European rules along with sufficient scope for decentralised decisions of national regulators seem to be optimal. Especially interesting is that networks of regulatory authorities (as BEREC in telecommunications) can play an important role in regard to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of (de) centralisation. Whereas in regard to telecommunication a further shifting of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> to the EU level cannot be recommended, both in energy and railway markets it might still be necessary to strengthen the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> of the EU...|$|R

Our results show how three types of standardization work - calculative framing, engaging and valorizing - support the design, legitimation and monitoring processes whereby a standard acquires its <b>regulatory</b> <b>power.</b> Our findings reveal new facets in the dynamics of standardization by approaching standardization as a product of institutional work and in showing how unintended consequences of that work can be recaptured to strengthen the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> of the standard...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of mutual recognition is almost universally acclaimed for removing barriers to trade, for enabling regulatory competition, and for preserving scope for regulatory autonomy instead of {{embarking on a}} path to harmonisation and centralisation. By using economic theories of legal federalism and regulatory competition, this paper shows that mutual recognition leads {{to a number of}} inconsistencies, which question its suitability as a conflict of law rule that guarantees a stable allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> within a two-level system of regulations. Mutual recognition should be understood more as a dynamic principle, which triggers a reallocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> between different jurisdictional levels. It leads either back to the country of destination principle, to a free market for regulations, or to harmonisation. The European experience suggests that a regime of mutual recognition is primarily another path to convergence and harmonisation, instead of being an instrument that preserves decentralised <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> or even <b>regulatory</b> competition. The welfare gains from achieving market integration should be balanced against the welfare losses of an inefficient allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers.</b> Copyright 2008 The Authors.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of organizational variety in regulatory governance must recognize that, {{contrary to the}} classical agency model, regulatory functions are commonly diffused {{among a number of}} public and sometimes private bodies. A regimes approach assists in understanding the ways in which diffuse <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> is exercised and in identifying central issues for analysis. In this article, six parameters for classifying organizations in regulatory regimes are addressed: ownership, legal form, funding, functions, powers, and governance level. An exploration of these parameters is suggestive of novel approaches to questions of independence and accountability. With wide diffusion of <b>regulatory</b> <b>power,</b> interdependence is as much a hallmark of the regulatory state as the application of any strong independence doctrine. Accountability may be better conceived as consisting both of formal judicial and political mechanisms and of informal day-to-day ways in which those exercising <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> have to account to others co-located within the space of a particular regulatory regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{investment}} of a regulated firm affects the service/good provided on many dimensions. Should an integrated regulator {{take care of}} them all? Or is it better to have separate regulators responsible for them? We analyze the effect of the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> on the regulated firm's ex ante incentive to invest in a "cooperative" innovation. The effects of the innovation are not verifiable and the cost of investing is sunk, hence, there is a problem of hold-up. We find that when the innovation produces opposite effects the ex ante firm's incentive to invest is larger in the case of separation than in the case of integrated regulation. We also stress the risk of over-investment that the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> may induce. We maintain that along with classical incentive regulation-which mainly provides incentives for the firm to be efficient-the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> {{may play a role in}} providing an incentive for cooperative innovations.
