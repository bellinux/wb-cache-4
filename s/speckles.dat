5|$|The bird's {{head and}} upper body {{typically}} vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially {{on the forehead}} and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white <b>speckles</b> except on the remiges and rectrices (main wing feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown <b>speckles.</b> It {{has been found that}} at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the iris is blackish brown. The talons, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink to dark pinkish-grey and the talons are black.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} the modified <b>speckle</b> reducing anisotropic diffusion(SRAD) that uses wavelet decomposition for <b>speckle</b> reduction in medical ultrasound(US) images. As {{a first step}} of our approach, the coarse-to-fine classification is performed into each 2 D wavelet sub-band to determine homogenous speckle-related region. Next, SRAD is played on each wavelet sub-band that uses investigated <b>speckle</b> regions as scale <b>speckle</b> function. With <b>speckle</b> determination, homogenous region can be details calculated without manual selection or preliminary exponential decay function. Moreover, variety pattern of <b>speckle</b> is reduced by the proposed modified SRAD on multiscale wavelet. Relying on this progress, the proposed method can improve the image quality for both subjective visualization and auto-segmentation. Finally, we validate our method to compare with current <b>speckle</b> reduction filters using simulated <b>speckle</b> images and clinical image. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is effective in <b>speckle</b> reduction as well as edge preservation.

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray <b>speckles,</b> but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Down-looking {{synthetic}} aperture imaging ladar(SAIL) has overcome many difficulties in side-looking SAIL. However, it is inevitably {{impacted by the}} <b>speckle</b> effect. There is temporally varying <b>speckle</b> effect due to the angular deflecting of two coaxial polarization-orthogonal beams transmitted in the orthogonal direction of travel, and a spatial varying <b>speckle</b> effect in the travel direction. Under the coaxial heterodyne, phase variations caused by <b>speckle</b> effect are compensated, leaving the amplitude variations of <b>speckle</b> field.

The mean <b>speckle</b> size is computed through two approaches using both the two-dimensional and the one-dimensional normalized autocorrelation function in intensity.

25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black <b>speckles</b> on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a {{completely}} different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes {{as small as a}} single drop. This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} fairly deeply colored, {{usually in a}} single color, and have a hard porcelain-like gloss. Colors vary with species, ranging through green, purple, violet, turquoise, steel grey, {{chocolate}} and lemon-yellow. White is rare, but does occur. Though the eggs are bright and colorful when laid, over time they fade and become duller. For example, the egg of the red-winged tinamou dulls from purple to leaden. Most tinamou eggs are solid colored, without spots or specling; however, the eggs of Tinamotis species may exhibit small white <b>speckles.</b> The benefit of laying brightly colored eggs is unknown, but is not detrimental as most tinamou predators hunt at night.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well preserved Anchiornis specimen in the Beijing Museum of Natural History to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this Anchiornis when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of Sinosauropteryx), Anchiornis became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved). The study found that most of the body feathers of this Anchiornis specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly rufous with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous <b>speckles</b> among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of <b>speckles</b> on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season {{begins with the}} rains. The male sings from a high perch and also performs aerobatic manoeuvers with rising and falling before diving with song notes. The song is a squeaky series of calls: chiwee-chiwee-chiwi-chip-chip-chip (or yousee-yousee-yousee-which-which-which-which). The nest is a cup of grass placed between leaves that are sewn together with cobwebs and resembles the nest of a common tailorbird but tends to be placed closer to the ground. The typical clutch consists {{of three or four}} eggs. The eggs vary in colour and they include glossy blue, pinkish white, greenish-blue or even pure white.

40|$|It {{is known}} that a phase-perturbed object field from a fractal-like rough surface {{illuminated}} by a partially coherent beam generates <b>speckle</b> on the image plane. In this works, aberration effects on Gaussian <b>speckle</b> on the image plane in both perfectly and partially coherent systems are theoretically and experimentally investigated. Theory shows that the second order statistics of Gaussian laser <b>speckle</b> are independent of odd-functional aberrations, but they do affect Gaussian <b>speckle</b> contrast in a partially coherent system. Furthermore, it is theoretically derived that field statistics of Gaussian laser <b>speckle</b> generally become non-circular Gaussian due to aberrations, and an aberration effect is asymptotically ignorable for very weak or strong roughness. A brute force simulation method is introduced for non-Gaussian <b>speckle</b> in a partially coherent imaging system, where <b>speckle</b> irradiance is calculated from a quasi-monochromatic extended incoherent source.
