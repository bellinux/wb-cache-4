They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae.

40|$|Three-dimensional <b>spacer</b> fabrics {{are used}} for sports {{textiles}} and foundation garments such as bra cups and pads for swimwear. Very often these <b>spacer</b> fabrics are molded into a desirable shape in order to fit with consumers' body contour. Thermal-mechanical properties of the <b>spacer</b> fabric are greatly affecting the molding properties and shape conformity of the molded <b>spacer</b> product. In this study, five different <b>spacer</b> fabrics were molded to a desirable bra cup shape with 6 cm cup depth (equivalent to a size 38 B's bra). The optimal molding conditions including molding temperature and molding time for each <b>spacer</b> fabric were found. It was shown that not all <b>spacer</b> fabrics can be molded to a desired cup shape. The thermal-mechanical properties determined by TMA revealed that the optimal molding conditions and compressive strain of molded <b>spacer</b> fabrics {{are closely related to}} the material used as <b>spacer</b> yarn, the density of <b>spacer</b> yarn, and the elongation and recovery of the <b>spacer</b> fabric.

To know the effects, a grid <b>spacer</b> with or without MV was inserted in a vertical circular pipe of 16 -mm internal diameter. For three cases (i. e., no <b>spacer,</b> <b>spacer</b> without MV, and <b>spacer</b> with MV), the liquid film thickness, liquid entrainment fraction, and deposition rate were measured by the constant current method, single liquid film extraction method, and double liquid film extraction method, respectively. The MVs significantly promote the re-deposition of liquid droplets in the gas core flow into the liquid film on the channel walls. The deposition mass transfer coefficient is three times higher for the <b>spacer</b> with MV than for the <b>spacer</b> without MV, even for cases 0. 3 -m downstream from the <b>spacer.</b> The liquid film thickness becomes thicker upstream and downstream for the <b>spacer</b> with MV, compared with the thickness for the <b>spacer</b> without MV and for the case with no <b>spacer...</b>|$|R

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed <b>spacers</b> to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} now {{thought to have}} evolved from an Agaricus ancestor, and adapted for {{survival}} in dry habitats. These adaptations include: a cap that does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on turgor pressure achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a partial veil that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured. This form of growth is called secotioid development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like Battarrea phalloides, Podaxis pistillaris, and Montagnea arenaria. Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the partial large subunit of ribosomal DNA and of the internal transcribed <b>spacers</b> shows that A.deserticola {{is closely related to}} but distinct from A.aridicola. A separate analysis showed A.deserticola to be closely related to A.arvensis and A.abruptibulbus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spacer</b> is a {{three-dimensional}} knitted fabric {{consisting of two}} outer textile substrates which are joined together and kept apart by <b>spacer</b> yarns. <b>Spacer</b> fabrics are used for environmental reasons, {{which can be used}} in different product groups such as mobile textiles (car seat covers, dashboard cover), industrial textiles (composites), medical textiles (anti-decubitus blankets), sports textiles and foundation garments (bra cups, pads for swimwear). In this study, the characteristics of different <b>spacer</b> fabrics including low-stress mechanical properties, air permeability and thermal conductivity were investigated. Low-stress mechanical properties obtained by the KES-fabric evaluation system revealed that all tensile, bending and compression properties of <b>spacer</b> fabrics are greatly {{depending on the type of}} <b>spacer</b> fabric (warp knit or weft knit), the type of <b>spacer</b> yarn used (monofilament or multifilament), the yarn count of the <b>spacer</b> yarn, the stitch density and the <b>spacer</b> yarn configuration.

40|$|The present {{work has}} {{reported}} the compression properties of polyurethane-based warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> fabric composites (PWSF). In order {{to investigate the}} effect of structural parameters of fabric on the compression performance of composites, a series of warp-knitted <b>spacer</b> fabrics (WSF) with different structural parameters including <b>spacer</b> yarn inclination angle, thickness, fineness of <b>spacer</b> yarns, and outer layer structure have been involved. The produced composites have been characterized for compression properties. The energy-absorption performance during the compression process has been determined {{as a function of}} the efficiency and the compression stress obtained from compression tests. The results show that the composites based on <b>spacer</b> fabrics having smaller <b>spacer</b> yarns inclination angle, higher fabric thickness, finer <b>spacer</b> yarn, and larger mesh in outer layers perform better with respect to energy-absorption properties at lower stress level, whereas at higher stress level, the best energy-absorption abilities are obtained in case of <b>spacer</b> fabrics constructed of larger <b>spacer</b> yarn inclination angle, lower fabric thickness, coarser <b>spacer</b> yarn, and smaller mesh in surface layers...|$|R
40|$|Effects of ice-shedding-induced cable {{vibration}} on <b>spacer</b> dampers are {{studied by}} applying a dynamic model. The model {{is based on}} the authors' recent development, which is improved here by applying <b>spacer</b> properties obtained experimentally. The model simulates cable vibration and bundle rotation at mid-span, where the <b>spacer</b> is attached to the cables, as well as the <b>spacer</b> deformation and forces acting on the <b>spacer</b> during the vibration of twin, triple and quad conductor bundles. Ice accumulation on a <b>spacer</b> may change the latter's elastic and damping properties, whose influence on the vibration is considered in the model together with the effect of varying cable properties. Simulation results show how the risk of bundle collapse and the load on the <b>spacer</b> is reduced when the number of subconductors in the bundle is increased. The model also predicts that the most important property which can reduce forces acting on the <b>spacer</b> during vibration is <b>spacer</b> damping, whereas the bundle rotation is affected to the greatest extent by cable damping...|$|R

A collapse on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations near Elephant & Castle station filled the tunnel with soil.

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow <b>spacers.</b> The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
25|$|Multiple CRISPRs contain many <b>spacers</b> to {{the same}} phage. The {{mechanism}} that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of E. coli.

This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired <b>spacers</b> that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.

Also this calculation shows that in nonferromagnetic <b>spacer</b> the induced magnetization can undergo many complete rotations depending on distance to the boundaries with the MOLs. Moreover, absolute value of induced magnetization nonmonotonously decays with distance from the interfaces inside the <b>spacer.</b> It is shown that the character of the decay of absolute value magnetization from the interfaces into the interior of the <b>spacer</b> is influenced by magnetic field...|$|R
