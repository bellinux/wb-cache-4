5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to extradite Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him as he saw fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch when confronted by powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy of these states to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E
5|$|After {{military}} service, Jarrell {{moved to}} Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It was in Chicago where Jarrell {{would have his}} first museum experiences. Growing in up Georgia, African Americans {{were not allowed to}} visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and her ideas about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.|$|E

6000|$|Second, Thy {{fears that}} Christ will not receive thee may be also a {{consequent}} of thy earnest and <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> after thy salvation by him. For this I observe, that <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> have, are attended with strong fears of missing. What man most sets his heart upon, {{and what his}} desires are most after, he ofttimes most fears he shall not obtain. So the man, the ruler of the synagogue, had a great desire that his daughter should live; and that desire was attended with fear, that she should not. Wherefore, Christ saith unto him, [...] "Be not afraid" [...] (Mark 5:36).|$|R
