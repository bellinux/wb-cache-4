50|$|The story {{follows a}} sentient war machine, Chalcedony, {{which is the}} lone {{survivor}} of a previous and highly apocalyptic war that has reduced the human population virtually to cavemen and hunter gatherers. As Chalcedony combs the beach looking <b>for</b> <b>trinkets</b> it can make into memorials for its fallen comrades, she develops a friendship with an orphaned boy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But he was {{an extravagant}} fellow,' said Mr. Annesley: 'he called me in at his bouleversement for advice, as I have the {{reputation}} of a good economist. I {{do not know how}} it is, though I see these things perpetually happen; but why men, and men of small fortunes, should commit such follies, really exceeds my comprehension. Ten thousand pounds <b>for</b> <b>trinkets,</b> and nearly as much for old furniture!' ...|$|R
60|$|The rapids and the Tachun River passed, it {{was almost}} a {{straight}} sail northwest to the ruins of old Fort Selkirk. But little could be seen of the former fort, the Indians having overturned the very foundations in their search <b>for</b> <b>trinkets</b> and articles of value. They encamped at the spot over-night and were joined on the following morning by two other parties who had crossed Chilkoot Pass two days after themselves.|$|R
50|$|A jewelry box, {{also known}} as a casket, is a {{receptacle}} <b>for</b> <b>trinkets,</b> not only jewels. It may take a very modest form, covered in leather and lined with satin, or it may reach the monumental proportions of the jewel cabinets which were made for Marie Antoinette, one of which is at Windsor Castle, and another at the Palace of Versailles; the work of Schwerdfeger as cabinetmaker, Degault as miniature-painter, and Thomire as chaser.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} visits to Tasmania by European explorers, the Nuenonne, {{normally}} in parties of about eight men, were often very welcoming, greeting explorers {{from the shore}} with friendly shouts and exchanging food and water <b>for</b> <b>trinkets.</b> At first they thought the Europeans were spirits who arrived {{on the backs of}} great birds, believing the European ship's sails looked like Seagull wings. However, tension grew quickly amongst the Nuenonne as they realised the British detachment was intending to stay.|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{after this}} {{a number of}} canoes came off to the ship, and the natives, {{to the number of}} fifty, came on board without fear, saying that they had heard such an account of the {{kindness}} of the sailors from the three boys, that they had come to trade with them. And they did trade with them, {{to such an extent that}} they parted with everything they had, even stripping off their clothes, and offering them in exchange <b>for</b> <b>trinkets</b> of little value! ...|$|R
60|$|Beaver-skins at {{this time}} were worth 25 shillings a piece in the markets of civilised lands, and in the Snake country, through which our friends were travelling, {{thousands}} of them were to be had from the Indians <b>for</b> <b>trinkets</b> and baubles that were scarce worth a farthing. A beaver-skin could be procured from the Indians for a brass finger ring or a penny looking-glass. Horses were also so numerous that one could be procured for an axe or a knife.|$|R
60|$|It is true, Bury Fair, like Bartholomew Fair, is a {{fair for}} diversion, more than for trade; {{and it may be}} a fair for toys and <b>for</b> <b>trinkets,</b> which the ladies may think fit to lay out some of their money in, as they see occasion. But to judge from thence that the knights' daughters of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Suffolk--that is to say, for it cannot be {{understood}} any otherwise, the daughters of all the gentry of the three counties--come hither to be picked up, is a way of speaking I never before heard any author have the assurance to make use of in print.|$|R
50|$|The young German {{officer who}} becomes {{friends with the}} children. He first spots Framboise in the market in Les Laveuses {{stealing}} an orange, but doesn't call her on it. Later he's intrigued by her character, and the kids trade information about {{the people in the}} village with him <b>for</b> <b>trinkets</b> and magazines. He is an ambivalent character, pursuing his own interests, indifferent to Nazi ideology, unafraid of the negative consequences of his actions. He is a skilled manipulator of people and is not averse to using children to achieve his ends, but he is also kind to Framboise and understands her better than anyone else.|$|R

50|$|Whaling ships plied the Pacific {{along the}} coast of Peru and Japan as early as 1818. Hawaii sat {{directly}} between the two. Lahaina and Honolulu became the main Pacific ports for the north Pacific whaling fleet. Since Lahaina had no real harbor, ships anchored in the Lahaina Roads off Maui's southwest coast for shore leave. By 1824 more than 100 ships visited Lahaina a year. As Hawaii's capital, it quickly drew enterprising immigrants who opened taverns, brothels, inns, and shops. Hawaiians paddled out to the ships to trade fresh fruit and produce <b>for</b> <b>trinket</b> trade goods such a beads, mirrors, metal implements, and cloth. At its height in the 1850s more than 400 whaling ships a year visited Lahaina.|$|R
