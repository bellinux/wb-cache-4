2500|$|Berners-Lee {{considered}} HTML an <b>SGML</b> <b>application.</b> The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formally {{defined it}} as such with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification: [...] by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document Type Definition to define the grammar. Many of the HTML text elements {{are found in the}} 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from those used by typesetters to manually format documents. Steven DeRose argues that HTML's use of descriptive markup (and influence of SGML in particular) was {{a major factor in the}} success of the Web, because of the flexibility and extensibility that it enabled. HTML became the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser, and is quite likely the most used markup language in the world today.|$|E

50|$|While HTML was {{developed}} partially independently and {{in parallel with}} SGML, its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, intended {{it to be an}} application of SGML. The design of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) was therefore inspired by SGML tagging, but, since no clear expansion and parsing guidelines were established, most actual HTML documents are not valid SGML documents. Later, HTML was reformulated (version 2.0) to be more of an <b>SGML</b> <b>application,</b> however, the HTML markup language has many legacy- and exception- handling features that differ from SGML's requirements. HTML 4 is an <b>SGML</b> <b>application</b> that fully conforms to ISO 8879 - SGML.|$|E
5000|$|Document markup {{languages}} defined using SGML {{are called}} [...] "applications" [...] by the standard; many pre-XML <b>SGML</b> <b>applications</b> were proprietary {{property of the}} organizations which developed them, and thus unavailable in the World Wide Web. The following list is of pre-XML <b>SGML</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|R
40|$|In most {{specific}} <b>SGML</b> <b>applications,</b> DTDs aren’t {{enough to}} express what the designer had in mind. SGML {{is very good}} for structure specification. But, sometimes this structure is very loose, gives too much freedom to the user creating a margin for errors. The solution is constraining that structure according to the final document type purposes. This way the user (who writes the documents according to that DTD) will not have full control of his data; he will be enforced to obey certain domain range limitations or certain information relationships. In this paper we will discuss the way we can do or {{can not do this}} inside <b>SGML</b> <b>applications</b> (<b>SGML</b> capacity to host constraints). We will discuss ways of associating a constraint language to the SGML model. Furthermore we will try to define the scope of that language. In the end, {{what we are trying to}} do is to add a new semantic validation process to the SGML authoring and processing model. We will present also several case studies where the absence of semantic validation could be quite tragic. Concluding this paper we will present a simple solution that implements the discussed constraint language and puts it to work with existing <b>SGML</b> <b>applications</b> (our case studies). ...|$|R

5000|$|Although its syntax {{closely resembles}} that of SGML, HTML5 has {{abandoned}} any attempt to be an <b>SGML</b> <b>application</b> and has explicitly defined its own [...] "html" [...] serialization, {{in addition to an}} alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.|$|E
5000|$|Initially code-named [...] "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element {{types and}} attributes, {{but at the}} same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup {{features}} by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets.

5000|$|SGMLguid was {{an early}} <b>SGML</b> <b>application</b> used at CERN that was the {{original}} inspiration of HTML. Because SGMLguid files were commonly named with [...]sgml as a file extension, it has sometimes been confused with SGML itself, which is why SGML has sometimes been incorrectly cited as the predecessor of HTML, while, in fact, SGMLguid and HTML are both SGML applications.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{more and}} more {{companies}} are evolving into world wide operating enterprises embedded in interdependent networks of communication, information exchange and product manufacturing. An up-to-date enterprise is spread over several sites with distributed subsidiaries for administration, product launches and manufacturing. At the same time internationalization is combined with a strong need for efficient information exchange in an open system environment. Information mangagment and dissemination is becoming a key issue to success in every phase of the product life cycle. Any solution must take all these developments into account. With SGML-based documents and tools a flexible approach can be made towards open system independent document mangagement with re-usable portions of information. In this paper different aspects are described: the steps required {{to set up an}} SGML-based application are introduced, ideas and the benefits af Literate Programming to <b>SGML</b> <b>applications</b> are explained, database functionality in distributed environments is presented, and document exchange and hypermedia documents are considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{methods for}} constructing a static model that completely and precisely describes DTDs with exceptions. A software tool {{has been written}} to implement the methods and to demonstrate some practical applications. Examples are shown of how the tool is used for DTD authoring, and some useful extensions of the tool are described. For one example DTD, {{the output of the}} tool is converted into a regular expression grammar. Preliminary studies indicate that general case algorithms can be developed for this conversion. This would allow existing theory for the context free languages to be used in developing <b>SGML</b> <b>applications.</b> Statistical results are shown from running the software tool on a number of industry and government DTDs and for three successive versions of HTML. The results illustrate that the complexity of DTDs in practice is approaching, or has exceeded, manageable limits with existing tools. The formal model and its applications are needed for SGML and continued development of these methods may impact the evolution of HTML, XML, and related web publishing standards. Some specific projects are proposed, where continued development of the model can result in more powerful tools and new kinds of <b>applications</b> for <b>SGML.</b> Introductio...|$|R
5000|$|The charter for the {{recently}} revived World Wide Web Consortium HTML Working Group says, [...] "the Group will {{not assume that}} an SGML parser is used for 'classic HTML'". Although HTML syntax closely resembles SGML syntax with the default reference concrete syntax, HTML5 abandons any attempt to define HTML as an <b>SGML</b> <b>application,</b> explicitly defining its own parsing rules, which more closely match existing implementations and documents. It does, however, define an alternative XHTML serialization, which conforms to XML and therefore to SGML as well.|$|E
50|$|DocBook {{originally}} {{started out}} as an <b>SGML</b> <b>application,</b> but an equivalent XML application was developed and has now replaced the SGML one for most uses. (Starting with version 4 of the SGML DTD, the XML DTD continued with this version numbering scheme.) Initially, a key group of software companies used DocBook since their representatives were involved in its initial design. Eventually, however, DocBook {{was adopted by the}} open source community where it has become a standard for creating documentation for many projects, including FreeBSD, KDE, GNOME desktop documentation, the GTK+ API references, the Linux kernel documentation, and the work of the Linux Documentation Project.|$|E

Windows and Unix versions followed in 1991. Author/Editor 3.0 was summarized as [...] "a very pure structure editor which validates the document all the time. Invalid documents can also be edited if the parser is turned off. The main window is a QUASIWYG representation of text, a structure view and a context view are also available. The structure view shows tags indented, the context view shows paths in the same way. An element list is used to pick up an element to insert. The representation on screen is done with a style editor, which generates style files. The program has many DTD with it, but new DTD's are imported by the RulesBuilder, which converts a DTD to a structure definition required by Author/Editor. There is an English thesaurus and a dictionary for spell checking." ...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{has moved}} rapidly toward {{electronic}} production, management, {{and dissemination of}} scientific and technical information. The World-Wide Web (WWW) has become a primary means of information dissemination. Electronic commerce (EC) is becoming the preferred means of procurement. DOE, like other government agencies, depends on and encourages the use of international standards in data communications. Like most government agencies, DOE has expressed a preference for openly developed standards over proprietary designs promoted as ``standards&#x 27;&#x 27; by vendors. In particular, there is a preference for standards developed by {{organizations such as the}} International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) that use open, public processes to develop their standards. Among the most widely adopted international standards is the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, ISO 8879 : 1986, FIPS 152), to which DOE long ago made a commitment. Besides the official commitment, which has resulted in several specialized projects, DOE makes heavy use of coding derived from SGML: Most documents on the WWW are coded in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is an <b>application</b> of <b>SGML.</b> The World-Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C), with the backing of major software houses like Adobe, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, Oracle, and Sun, is promoting XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a class of <b>SGML</b> <b>applications,</b> {{for the future of the}} WWW and the basis for EC. In support of DOE&#x 27;s use of these standards, the authors has served since 1985 as Chairman of the international committee responsible for SGML and related standards, ISO/IEC JTC 1 /SC 34 (SC 34) and its predecessor organizations. During his June 2000 trip, he chaired the spring 2000 meeting of SC 34 in Paris, France. He also attended a major conference on the use of SGML and XML and led a meeting of the International SGML/XML Users&#x 27; Group (ISUG). In addition to the widespread use of the WWW among DOE&#x 27;s plants and facilities in Oak Ridge and among DOE sites across the nation, there are several SGML-based projects at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. The local project team developed an SGML-based publications system that has been used for several major reports at the Y- 12 Plant and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). SGML is a component of the Weapons Records Archiving and Preservation (WRAP) project at the Y- 12 Plant and is the format for catalog metadata chosen for weapons records by the Nuclear Weapons Information Group (NWIG). The Ferret system for automated classification analysis will use XML to structure its knowledge base.

40|$|XML is an SGML-based {{language}} {{designed for}} the interchange of documents with more flexible and powerful features than those provided by HTML.

On the other hand, XML is not restricted to a fixed DTD as HTML is: users can choose from the set of available DTDs the one that is best suited for their applications, or develop new ones for fully satisfying their requirements. Although XML is initially a meta-language intended for publishing on the Web, there are many other applications of XML. Some of them are being widely used, some others are under investigation and some others still need be to be conceived.
