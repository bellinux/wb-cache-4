[...] -The flutter {{problems}} of high-speed aircraft are considered generally and specific consideration is then {{given to the}} new problems introduced {{by the use of}} new wing plan forms. The theoretical and experimental results on the coupled ('classical') <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flutter</b> of swept (including, 'barbed ' and cranked forms) and delta wings is reviewed and presented to show the effect and importance of the body freedoms of the aircraft on the critical flutter speed and frequency. A criterion is proposed for deciding the 'dangerous type ' of fundamental normal mode to be considered in flutter calculations. The danger here is that the fundamental normal mode can combine with the body freedoms and give rise to a form of flutter which is independent of the wing torsional stiffness. It is suggeste&that the deciding feature is the shape of the nodal line in the fundamental mode. If it is such as to indicate rotation of the fore-and-aft wing sections near the tip, then the mode is considered to be dangerous. 1. Introduction. [...] In classical t symmetrical fltitter of conventional wings the flutter motion is predominantly that of the elastic modes of deformation of the wing in flexure and torsion, occurring at a frequency between the natural frequencies of these modes (usually nearer to the higher torsional frequency) and the wing torsional stiffness is the main criterion for design...|$|E
