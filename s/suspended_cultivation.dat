40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for the culture of G. gracilis, an indigenous red alga, into the west coast mariculture farm Jacobs Bay Sea Products Pty. Various methods for cultivating Gracilaria as well as environmental parameters, which influence growth of Gracilaria, are disltussed below. From these optimal conditions for the polycultivation of G. gracilis are determined. Cultivation can take place either, in open waters, or on land. Open water systems are generally less intensive than land based operations. Open water systems can be either bottom planted or suspended. <b>Suspended</b> <b>cultivation</b> has the advantage of maintaining the plant thalli in optimal light intensities. Land based systems can make use of ponds, raceways or tanks. Tanks and raceways are more productive than ponds, but require higher ﬂow rates and regulated nutrient regimes...|$|E
40|$|A {{metal frame}} with {{dimensions}} of 1 x 1 x 1 m for the <b>suspended</b> <b>cultivation</b> of Gracilaria gracilis (Stackhouse) Steentoft, Irvine and Farnham was settled {{in shallow water}} in Inciralti in Izmir Bay. The alga was tied by sixteen ropes {{just below the surface}} of the water (0. 1 - 0. 2 m), at mid depths (0. 6 - 0. 7 m) and near the bottom (1. 1 - 1. 2 m). The total of 16 plants were measured weekly from July 28 th to October 20 th 2002. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, orthophosphate and silica were also analysed. The healthy growth of algae was observed only at mid depth. The plants near to the surface died because of waves, water level fluctuations or direct sunlight. Gracilaria suspended near to bottom was lost, consumed by fish or bleached and died after two weeks. Relative growth rates varied from 8. 2 to 0. 96 % day - 1. At the end of the experiment, mean individual weight of plants reached to 9. 3 g...|$|E
40|$|Porphyridium cruentum {{is one of}} {{the most}} valued microalgae species able to produce both {{pigments}} and exopolysaccharides. Conventional liquid <b>suspended</b> <b>cultivation</b> in ponds and photobioreactors show its disadvantages in lower cultivation efficiency and higher stirring power consumption due to the high viscosity of the medium by the accumulation of polysaccharides. In this work, a new method of culture (called attached cultivation) based on the growth of microalgae using a supporting surface was successfully applied to the cultivation of P. cruentum and the effect of the main influential parameters on its growth rate and polysaccharides production has been investigated. Higher values of these factors resulted in a faster growth rate and, in particular, optimum values of 6. 98 g m(- 2) for initial biomass density, 100 A mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) for light intensity, continuous illumination, 2. 0 % for CO 2 concentration, and 0. 1 v v(- 1) min(- 1) for aeration rate produced the best polysaccharide production of 42 % dry weight. The nutrition profile of P. cruentum obtained in attached and suspended cultivations was similar. Overall these results demonstrate that the attached cultivation is a promising technique which greatly improves the growth rate of P. cruentum as well as its production of polysaccharides and, therefore, it is worth enhancing to be exploited for commercial application...|$|E
40|$|Biofilm-based microalgae {{cultivation}} techniques are promising technologies to overcome several issues of <b>suspended</b> <b>cultivations,</b> although {{only a few}} large-scale systems have been examined so far. In this study, a rotating biological contactor-based laboratory-scale Algadisk reactor of 0. 39 m 2 was tested under low light intensity, and then scaled up to 15. 9 m 2 and operated for 6 months in outdoor conditions {{in order to test}} its stability and biomass production efficiency with Chlorella sorokiniana. The highest biomass productivity observed in the lab-scale reactor on disk surface base was 3. 2 g (m 2 day) - 1 with a 0. 9 g mol - 1 biomass yield on light and 208 g kg - 1 dry weight content in biofilm. Due to pH crashes, extreme temperature variations, CO 2 limitation, and failure of disk rotation, the Algadisk pilot system showed varying biomass productivity from 0. 5 to 8. 4 g (m 2 day) - 1 on reactor footprint area. Also, biomass yield on light and biomass density remained lower than at laboratory scale. Nonetheless, a total of 7. 4 kg CO 2 was fixed in the biofilm during the operating time. Despite the difficulties and the complexity of the system, over 20 weeks of continuous operation was achieved without the need of reinoculation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{upstream}} water {{development in}} the South Indian Krishna Basin has resulted in declining water availability downstream. Upstream water use is not adjusted to reflect rainfall fluctuations, and downstream farmers of the Nagarjuna Sagar irrigation project {{in the state of}} Andhra Pradesh are increasingly vulnerable to water supply shocks. Understanding the adaptive capacity of irrigated command areas to fluctuating water conditions is critical. This paper documents the wide range of adjustments adopted by managers and farmers in Nagarjuna Sagar during a period of fluctuating water availability (2000 - 2007). Primary and secondary data indicate managerial adjustments such as rotational and timely water supplies to meet critical water demands of standing crops. Farmers responded to changing conditions through: (a) crop diversification, (b) shifting calendars, (c) conjunctive use, (d) <b>suspending</b> <b>cultivation,</b> (e) sale of livestock, (f) out-migration, and (g) tampering with the irrigation system. Adaptive strategies are more diverse in the tail-end than in the head-end of the canal network and local adjustments are often uncoordinated and may degrade the resource base. A better understanding of the practices induced by changes in water availability is needed to refine current water allocation and management in large surface irrigation projects. Crop diversification, deficit irrigation in low-flow years, and conjunctive use are some of the practices to be promoted in a conducive agricultural environment.

40|$|This note {{investigates the}} effect of the German governments' {{decision}} to <b>suspend</b> the <b>cultivation</b> of genetically modified maize on the stock returns of involved companies. Moreover, the first announcement to investigate a ban as well as a court decision rejecting Monsanto's lawsuit against the suspension are considered. This study is motivated by the expectation that these decisions have consequences beyond the small German market for genetically modified maize. An event study is used to evaluate the economic impacts on stock returns of Monsanto, Bayer and BASF. We find slight evidence that stock prices of Monsanto and BASF responded negatively to the German suspension of genetically modified maize.

40|$|Microencapsulation {{technology}} is a convenient method to alter and regulate cell product formation. In order to probe the metabolic response of different osmo-sensitive Sacchromyces cerevisiae to ACA microcapsule, the hyper-osmo-sensitive type S. cerevisiae (Y 02724) and wild type S. cerevisiae (BY 4741) were encapsulated into liquid core ACA microcapsules. The behavior of cell growth, glucose consumption, ethanol production and the yields of glycerol and organic acids were determined. Free cell culture was used as control. The enzyme activities of NADP(+) -glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) on microencapsulation cells and free cultured cells were measured too. The results demonstrated that the growth of Y 02724 in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was seriously inhibited by ACA microcapsule, while the ethanol and acetatic acid yield of microencapsulation Y 02724 in anaerobic condition {{were significantly higher than}} that of <b>suspended</b> <b>cultivation.</b> For Y 02724, the microencapsulation cultivation significantly increased the GS and GOGAT activities and decreased the GDH activity in comparison with control group. ACA microcapsules did not significantly change the growth behavior and metabolic performance of BY 4741, but decreased the GS activity. In conclusion, microcapsules microenvironment significantly changes the metabolism behavior of hyper-osmo-sensitive type S. cerevisiae (Y 02724), but nearly had no effect on BY 4741.

40|$|For <b>suspended</b> <b>cultivation</b> of {{seaweeds}} in {{the open}} ocean, the selection of suitable sites and the optimization of cultivation methods for maximum productivity are of utmost importance. Growth of raft-cultivated Gracilaria gracilis in Saldanha Bay {{is known to be}} badly affected in late summer due to the persistence of warm oligotrophic water at the ocean surface which prevents replenishment of nutrients by upwelling. This study documents the extent of nitrogen starvation during this period and investigates some possible methods of managing this problem. Nitrogen content, C:N ratio and stable isotope abundances of C and N were obtained for material grown for varying lengths of time, material grown at various depths and material that had been fertilized prior to placement on the raft. The relationship between thallus colour and nitrogen content was also documented using a standard colour guide. The onset of nitrogen starvation was rapid, occurring after about two weeks on the raft. Growth was optimized about a meter below the water surface, possibly as a result of photoinhibition of photosynthesis at the surface. Nitrogen limitation ceased below about 2 m growth depth. Prefertilization had no significant effect on yield after 4 weeks growth. Thallus colour showed a clear relationship with N content and may be a useful indicator of N status of cultivated Gracilaria. δ¹⁵N was related to N content and increased rapidly when N limitation was removed. Stable isotope natural abundance measurements are a useful tool in the study of growth environment, but more controlled experimentation investigating the factors which influence these values is needed, particularly for macroalgae...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the justifications invoked by the German government in April 2009 to <b>suspend</b> the <b>cultivation</b> of the {{genetically modified maize}} varieties containing the Bt insect-resistance trait MON 810. We have carried out a critical examination of the alleged new data on a potential environmental impact of these varieties, namely two scientific papers describing laboratory force-feeding trials on ladybirds and daphnia, and previous data on Lepidoptera, aquatic and soil organisms. We demonstrate that the suspension {{is based on an}} incomplete list of references, ignores the widely admitted case-by-case approach, and confuses potential hazard and proven risk in the scientific procedure of risk assessment.

40|$|Fungi {{producing}} high xylanase {{levels have}} attracted considerable attention {{because of their}} potential industrial applications. Batch cultivations of Aspergillus terricola fungus were evaluated in stirred tank and airlift bioreactors, by using wheat bran particles <b>suspended</b> in the <b>cultivation</b> medium as substrate for xylanase and b-xylosidase production. In the stirred tank bioreactor, in physical conditions of 30 °C, 300 rpm, and aeration of 1 vvm (1 l/min), with direct inoculation of fungal spores, 7, 475 U/l xylanase was obtained after 36 h of operation, remaining constant after 24 h. In the absence of air injection in the stirred tank reactor, limited xylanase production was observed (final concentration 740 U/l). When the fermentation process was realized in the airlift bioreactor, xylanase production was higher than that observed in the stirred tank bioreactor, being 9, 265 U/l at 0. 07 vvm (0. 4 l/min) and 12, 845 U/l at 0. 17 vvm (1 l/min) aeration rate.

40|$|Research into {{microbial}} xylanases {{production has}} increased {{due to its}} several applications. In this context, studies that make this practice feasible are important. Wheat bran is an inexpensive byproduct, which contains around 28 % hemicellulose; however, the wheat bran particles <b>suspended</b> in the <b>cultivation</b> medium have to be decomposed to soluble compounds {{to be used by}} the fungi and the treatment of lignocellulosic materials in autohydrolysis processes makes this easier. The inclusion of these treated materials in the nutrient media can be a strategy to increase and undervalue xylanase production. The best conditions for xylanase and β-xylosidase production were observed when A. ochraceus was cultivated with 1 % wheat bran added 10 % wheat straw autohydrolysis liquor as carbon source, this substrate was more favorable when compared with xylan, wheat bran and wheat straw autohydrolysis liquor used separately. The application of this substrate in a stirred tank bioreactor shows the need for improvements of the fermentation process...|$|R

We have carried out a critical examination of the alleged new data on a potential environmental impact of these varieties, namely two scientific papers describing laboratory force-feeding trials on ladybirds and daphnia, and previous data on Lepidoptera, aquatic and soil organisms. We demonstrate that the suspension {{is based on an}} incomplete list of references, ignores the widely admitted case-by-case approach, and confuses potential hazard and proven risk in the scientific procedure of risk assessment. Furthermore, we did not find any justification for this suspension in our extensive survey of the scientific literature regarding possible effects under natural field conditions on non-target animals. The vast majority of the 41 articles published in 2008 and 2009 indicate no impact on these organisms and only two articles indicate a minor effect, which is either inconsistent during the planting season or represents an indirect effect. Publications from 1996 to 2008 (376 publications) and recent meta-analyses do not allow to conclude on consistent effects either. The lower abundance of some insects concerns mainly specialized enemies of the target pest (an expected consequence of its control by Bt maize). On the contrary, Bt maize have generally a lower impact than insecticide treatment. The present review demonstrates that the available meta-knowledge on Cry 1 Ab expressing maize was ignored by the German government which instead used selected individual studies...|$|R
