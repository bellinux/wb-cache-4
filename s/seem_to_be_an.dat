5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

25|$|While PMS {{is linked}} to the luteal phase, the causes of PMS are not clear, but several factors may be involved. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} factor; changing hormone levels affect some women more than others. Chemical changes in the brain, stress, and emotional problems, such as depression, do not seem to cause PMS but they may make it worse. Low levels of vitamins and minerals, high sodium, alcohol, and/or caffeine can exacerbate symptoms such as water retention and bloating. PMS occurs more often in women who are between their late 20s and early 40s; have at least 1 child; {{have a family history of}} depression; and have a past medical history of either postpartum depression or a mood disorder.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) {{may also be a}} drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.|$|E
500|$|The Polish coup d'état {{attempt in}} Lithuania {{refers to a}} failed attempt by Polish statesman Józef Piłsudski to {{overthrow}} the existing Lithuanian government [...] of Prime Minister Mykolas Sleževičius, and install a pro-Polish cabinet that would agree to a union with Poland. The Polish intelligence agency, the Polish Military Organization (PMO) was {{to carry out the}} coup d'etat, planned to be implemented in August 1919. The coup was designed to <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> initiative by local Lithuanians aiming to free their government of German influence. The PMO hoped to rely on the assistance of sympathetic Lithuanian activists. They were thwarted by the lack of cooperation and the unwillingness of sufficient number of Lithuanians to support the Polish cause.|$|E

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the terraces are {{the remains of a}} three-dimensional labyrinth, first proposed by Geoffrey Russell in 1968. He states that the classical labyrinth (Caerdroia), a design found all over the Neolithic world, can be easily transposed onto the Tor, so that by walking around the terraces a person eventually reaches the top in the same pattern. Evaluating this hypothesis is not easy. A labyrinth would very likely place the terraces in the Neolithic era, but given the amount of occupation since then, there may have been substantial modifications by farmers and/or monks and conclusive excavations have not been carried out. In a more recent book, Hutton writes that [...] "the labyrinth does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ancient sacred structure".|$|E
500|$|Specifically, Paul H. Kocher {{argues that}} Tolkien {{describes}} {{evil in the}} orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in The Lord of the Rings, such as Sauron's [...] "Lidless Eye": [...] "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as Thomas Aquinas, [...] "whom {{it is reasonable to}} suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well". Tom Shippey makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, known as the Lays of Boethius. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: [...] "evil is nothing". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's remark, [...] "the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own", and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond. He goes on to argue that in The Lord of the Rings evil does sometimes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the Manichaean heresy), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.|$|E
500|$|However, several {{critics were}} more {{positive}} towards the show. A number of publications welcomed {{the show as}} [...] "guilty pleasure", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week. Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: [...] "my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake." [...] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated {{the success of the}} family which [...] "achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing," [...] using the given platform. Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: [...] "Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last". Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing {{all the way to the}} bank [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that [...] "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".|$|E

2500|$|Though no fossil pauropods {{have been}} found from before {{the time of the}} Baltic amber (...) , they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> old group closely related to the millipedes (Diplopoda).

2500|$|On July 15, 2009, Entertainment Weekly {{confirmed}} {{rumors that}} a graphic novel adaptation of Twilight {{was in the}} works.

According to EW, [...] "it doesn't look simply like an artist's rendering of Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson. In fact, the characters <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> amalgam of Meyer's literary imagination and the actors' actual looks."

2500|$|On {{the top of}} each {{tower is}} a {{pinnacle}} standing [...] tall. The pinnacles were more than just the finishing touches to the height of the towers, each taking over 19 weeks to construct and both being assembled outside the country. [...] One was constructed in Japan and the other in Korea. Each pinnacle is composed of 50 unique parts making up the main components: the spire, mast ball and ring ball. Together these parts weigh 176 tons. While the pinnacles may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic feature of the towers to enhance their presence and height, they also play function to aircraft warning lights and are an essential element to the overall Islamic minaret design that the towers embody.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, that Zurvanism was the {{predominant}} brand of Zoroastrianism during the cataclysmic years {{just prior to}} the fall of the empire, is, according to Duchesne-Guillemin, evident in the degree of influence that Zurvanism (but not Mazdaism) would have on the Iranian brand of Shi'a Islam. Writing in the historical present, he notes that [...] "under Chosrau II (r. 590-628) and his successors, all kinds of superstitions tend to overwhelm the Mazdean religion, which gradually disintegrates, thus preparing the triumph of Islam." [...] Thus, [...] "what will survive in popular conscience under the Muslim varnish is not Mazdeism: it is Zervanite fatalism, well attested in Persian literature" [...] (Duchesne-Guillemin, 1956:109). This is also a thought expressed by Zaehner, who observes that Ferdowsi, in his Shahnameh, [...] "expounds views which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> epitome of popular Zervanite doctrine" [...] (Zaehner, 1955:241). Thus, according to Zaehner and Duchesne-Guillemin, Zurvanism's pessimistic fatalism was a formative influence on the Iranian psyche, paving the way (as it were) for the rapid adoption of Shi'a philosophy during the Safavid era.|$|E
2500|$|High-tech {{systems are}} used in some {{national}} parks and popular wilderness areas, {{to cope with the}} increased volume of people engaged in activities such as mountaineering and kayaking. The growing popularity of paddling, hiking, and climbing has created special waste disposal issues throughout the world. It is a dominant topic for outdoor organizations and their members. For example, in some places the sewage is collected in drums which need to be helicoptered in and out at considerable expense. Alternatively, some parks mandate a [...] "pack it in, pack it out" [...] rule. Many reports document the use of containers for the removal of excrement, which must be packed in and packed out on Mount Everest. Also known as [...] "expedition barrels" [...] or [...] "bog barrels", the cans are weighed to make sure that groups do not dump them along the way. [...] "Toilet tents" [...] are erected. This would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> improvement over the prior practices, including the so-called [...] "McKinley system"; there has been an increasing awareness that the mountain needs to be kept clean, for the health of the climbers at least. Worm hold privies, another variant of the composting toilet, are being used by Vermont's Green Mountain Club. These simple outhouses are stocked with red worms (a staple used by home composters). Despite their environmental benefits, composting toilets are likewise subject to regulations.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Rodman from Boston Globe praised her {{performance}} in Boston at the TD Garden writing: [...] "the truly, remarkably indefatigable pop superstar powered {{her way through}} a performance just shy of two hours and heavy on the razzle dazzle but light on hits" [...] also noting how Madonna [...] "remains impressively fleet of foot, dancing nearly non-stop, and when she sang live, perfectly competent of voice, even if the mix didn’t always do her favors and her crew was impressive." [...] Hardeep Phull from the New York Post acclaimed {{her performance}} in Yankee Stadium, writing: [...] "the shock-and-awe tactics have been a staple of her 30-year career, but right now they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> especially savvy move" [...] and that the show [...] "remains a master class in performance and spectacle." [...] Chris Cobb from Ottawa Citizen called the performance in Ottawa: [...] "a Broadway show on wheels" [...] and writing: [...] "in a sense it doesn’t really matter what songs Madonna chooses to sing because the spectacle, with all its bells and whistles, is all." [...] Stephanie IP from The Province commented on her performance in Vancouver, writing: [...] "the Queen of Pop continued to reign supreme on the Vancouver stop of her worldwide tour" [...] and [...] "the effect Madge has had on {{paving the way for}} female artists and fans is incomparable." [...] Madonna's performance in Seattle was met again with critical acclaim. Andrew Matson and Sharon Pian Chan from The Seattle Times both praised her performance with Matson writing: [...] "The middle-aged Queen of Pop kicked off her concert by simulating a killing spree, complete with audiovisual effects. And it was some show: Two hours of hits from a remarkable career, with high-budget sets and intricate choreography" [...] and Chan writing: [...] "There is only one word to say after Madonna's extravaganza, spectacle and concert Tuesday night: Respect. Madonna tore it up on the dance floor at the age of 54." ...|$|E
