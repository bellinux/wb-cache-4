The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place}} of their beloved mother. Madonna later told Vanity Fair that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn's {{relentless}} {{energy and}} enthusiasm for life {{is often cited}} in biographies, while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status. This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress, and she was famously blunt and outspoken. Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be [...] "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy". Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, [...] "a me me me person". <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as having a happy nature, reasoning [...] "I like life and I've been so lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?" [...] A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years, and said that while she was demanding, she retained a sense of humility and humanity.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude. She explained in the May 1989 issue of Interview magazine: ...|$|E
50|$|Narda {{declined}} {{the responsibility of}} being Darna, since <b>she</b> just <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a simple girl and cannot take on such huge responsibility, but her mind changed when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the massive carnage {{brought about by the}} resurrection of the four super villains that were set free from their ice prisons from under the sea, after an earthquake triggered a tsunami and surfaced and destroyed the ice prisons.|$|R
5|$|Hogarth {{was still}} at work on A Harlot's Progress when she died, so <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> immortalised.

Though I was born here in London, I couldn't identify as British and anyway most British people don't accept us as British. God! British people can be so racist".|$|E
2500|$|Christie became {{increasingly}} tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary {{of his character}} Sherlock Holmes. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot [...] "insufferable", and by the 1960s she felt that he was [...] "an egocentric creep". However, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.|$|E
2500|$|Cookery {{writer and}} anti-poverty campaigner, Jack Monroe {{threatened}} a libel action against Katie Hopkins after Hopkins accused Monroe of vandalism {{to a war}} memorial, having confused Monroe with journalist Laurie Penny, who had written in support of that vandalism. Monroe called for an apology and a £5,000 donation to a migrants rescue charity. Hopkins later admitted that she was mistaken about the identity. Monroe began legal action in January 2016, and was awarded £24,000 in damages and £107,000 in legal costs in March 2017. After the decision became known, Hopkins tweeted an image of herself as the Virgin Mary and commented that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as [...] "the Jesus of the outspoken".|$|E

5000|$|Around 2003, a {{visit to}} her parents in Germany and an impromptu photo shoot had Iman {{questioning}} {{the difference between what}} <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>herself</b> in a mirror versus the self-portraits she shot while there. Returning to the states, she began exploring photography, lighting and the differences in perception versus reality in how all of us see and feel about ourselves.|$|R
5000|$|Isidro {{grew up in}} Marikina {{along with}} her parents and siblings. She is the {{youngest}} among the girls and considered herself as [...] "daddy's girl". Growing up, <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as beautiful because of her ethnic features as a child. Isidro was skinny, dark-skinned, black hair, and has knobby knees compared to her siblings who were light-skinned and has brown hair. Because of her looks, she was teased a lot by her siblings and relatives, which left her emotionally scarred.|$|R
2500|$|Davis {{wrote her}} {{consumer}} books over a 40-year career, revising {{some in the}} 1970s. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as an [...] "interpreter," [...] not merely a researcher. [...] "I {{think of myself as}} a newspaper reporter, who goes out to libraries and gathers information from hundreds of journals, which most people can't understand, and I write it so that people can understand." [...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance. Her references for Let's Get Well totaled almost 2,500, many from cases during her nutrition practice, and she was upset when the publisher of Let's Have Healthy Children eliminated the 2,000 references from the 1972 revision, says author Daniel Yergin.|$|E
2500|$|Sánchez's {{best known}} play is La Pasión según Antigona Pérez (The Passion of Antigona Perez), a tragedy set in present-day Latin America, {{suggested}} by Sophocles' Antigone. The character of Antigona {{was based on}} the life of Olga Viscal Garriga (1926–1995). Her life was rooted in politics and her three children. She {{was a member of the}} Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and an accomplished speaker who spent time in jail for her political beliefs yet, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a simple woman with simple needs. But, in fact, she was a very complex woman with many facets of her personality. The world premiere production took place in 1968 at Old San Juan's Tapia Theater, starring Myrna Vazquez as [...] "Antigona", during the 11th Annual Puerto Rican Theater Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Hutchinson took Cotton's doctrines {{concerning}} the Holy Ghost far beyond his teachings, and she [...] "saw {{herself as a}} mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty." [...] Her theology of direct personal revelation opposed {{the belief that the}} Bible was the final authority concerning divine revelation, which was basic to the Reformed doctrines held by the majority of English settlers at that time. She also adopted Cotton's minority view that works, behavior, and personal growth are not valid demonstrations of a person's salvation. [...] She went beyond this, however, and espoused some views that were more radical, devaluing the material world and suggesting that a person can become one with the Holy Spirit. [...] She also embraced the heterodox teaching of mortalism, the belief that the soul dies when the body dies, and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a prophetess. [...] She had prophesied that God was going to destroy England, and she prophesied during her trial that God would destroy Boston.|$|E
6000|$|And Alvina was to {{play the}} piano! Here was a blow for her! She hurried off to her bedroom to laugh and cry at once. <b>She</b> just <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> at that piano, banging off the Merry Widow Waltz, and, in tender moments, The Rosary. Time after time, The Rosary. While the {{pictures}} flickered and the audience gave shouts and some grubby boy called [...] "Chot-let, penny a bar! Chot-let, penny a bar! Chot-let, penny a bar!" [...] away she banged at another tune.|$|R
5000|$|The heroines in McKinley's books reflect certain {{qualities that}} <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>herself</b> {{as a young}} woman: clumsiness, plainness, bookishness, and disinterest in the usual social games that involve flirting and dating. She has said, [...] "I didn't {{discover}} boys because they didn't discover me, and because their standards of discovery seemed to me too odd to be aspired to. They {{were the ones who}} got to have adventures, while we got to—well, not have adventures." ...|$|R
60|$|The bawling and bellowing, the {{crackling}} of horns and pounding of hoofs, the dusty whirl of cattle, and the flying cowboys disconcerted Madeline and frightened her a little; {{but she was}} intensely interested and meant to stay there until <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> for <b>herself</b> what that strife of sound and action meant. When she tried {{to take in the}} whole scene she did not make out anything clearly and she determined to see it little by little.|$|R
2500|$|Vanessa {{was created}} in 2009 by Holby City {{executive}} producer Tony McHale, {{as a replacement for}} former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet), who departed from the show during its eleventh series. It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on. Also, I know there are lots of women out there who love this show and I don’t want them to be disappointed. I want them to say, 'She looks great!'".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Wilton {{came out as}} a lesbian, which gave her {{a strong sense of}} {{identity}} and politics as well as informing her intellectual work, although she never felt completely accepted by lesbians who had come out earlier in life because of her personal history of heterosexuality. She wrote in 1993, [...] "the positionality of [...] "lesbian" [...] offers a potent site from which to investigate the social, cultural and political interlocution of gender and sexuality". <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as having a distinctly lesbian perspective on the issues she researched in a way that challenged the assumptions of colleagues and gay men, particularly in relation to gendered behaviour. In the lesbian edition of Sexualities (3, May 2000), Wilton noted the marginalisation of lesbian issues within sexuality studies and the journal. This conflictual approach was contra-punctuated by a warms in her personal relationships, which embodied a strong sense of solidarity with co-workers on sexuality, especially with gay men. She was keen to rework the debates on the relationship between gender and sexuality, and sought to integrate them as a focus for interdisciplinary study that included health policy, film theory, sociology of sexuality, as well as feminist and queer theory. Wilton's writing was aimed at both academic and lay audiences. Her published material reflected theoretical work on sexuality aimed at academics, a book designed for practitioner training, an introductory text for policy makers, discussion about the self-fashioning required by women who transition from heterosexuality to lesbianism, books for lay members of the communities involved in her research, and an edited volume on lesbians and film.|$|E

50|$|Herrell {{spent her}} {{childhood}} in the United States and then settled down in Cebu City {{where her mother}} is from. In Cebu, she was a Mass Communication student at the University of San Jose-Recoletos before transferring to International Academy of Film and Television to study acting. Aside from studying, she also manages her own dance company called Mactan Dynamics. She was also a former managerial director of Solid Source Trading for the Visayas Region. She starred in a few commercials and short films prior joining beauty pageants and she shared the <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a beauty queen.|$|R
50|$|Scott started {{programming}} {{at the age}} of 12, {{by writing}} games for her TI-89 graphing calculator and sharing them with friends in middle school. She learned the Java and C++ programming languages and the MIPS architecture at Amherst College, but taught herself the skills she used for writing her own applications, Python, Objective C, and iOS. She says that though she enjoyed programming in college, she went into acting and modeling professionally because <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> spending her life around other computer programmers; after graduating, most of her programming was done alone. By 2017, she considered herself primarily a programmer.|$|R
5000|$|Joan Didion {{was born}} and raised in Sacramento, California, to parents Frank Reese and Eduene (née Jerrett) Didion. Didion recalls writing things down as early as age five, though she claims that <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a writer until after being published. She read {{everything}} she could get her hands on after learning how to read and even needed written permission from her mother to borrow adult books, biographies especially, from the library at a young age. With this, she identified herself as being a [...] "shy, bookish child", who pushed herself to overcome her social anxiety through acting and public speaking.|$|R

60|$|Had Lydia and {{her mother}} known the {{substance}} of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with {{the young and the}} gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.|$|E
60|$|And {{while these}} things were happening, {{what had become of}} the white doe? Though when she sprang from the {{carriage}} she was aware that some unkind fate had changed her into an animal, yet, till <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in a stream, {{she had no idea what}} it was.|$|E
60|$|Therefore, the parting {{took place}} on the shore. Simon solemnly blessed John, and his mother cried over him.

6000|$|Milly thought again, {{though with}} {{hindrance}} rather than help in {{her sense of}} the way their eyes now met--met as for their each seeing in the other more than either said.

Karrenbrock, [...] "McKinley's females do not simper; they do not betray their own nature to win a man's approval. But neither do they take love lightly or put their own desires before anything else. In McKinley's books, the romance, like the adventure, is based upon ideals of faithfulness, duty, and honor." ...|$|R
