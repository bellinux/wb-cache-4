40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} preamble-based low complexity <b>synchronization,</b> <b>channel</b> estimation and equalization for Zero-padded (ZP) MB-OFDM based UWB systems. The proposed {{synchronization method}} consists of sync detection, coarse timing estimation, fine timing estimation, and oscillator frequency offset estimation. The distinctive features of MB-OFDM {{systems and the}} interplay between the timing and carrier frequency hopping at the receiver are judiciously incorporated in the proposed synchronization method. In order to apply the low complexity one-tap frequency-domain equalizer, the required circular convolution property of the received signal is obtained {{by means of an}} overlap-add method after the frequency offset compensation. The proposed low complexity channel estimator for each band is developed by first averaging the over-lapadded received preamble symbols within the same band and then applying time-domain least-squares method followed by the discrete Fourier transform. We develop an MMSE equalizer and its approximate version with low complexity. We also derive the probability density functions of the UWB channel path delays, and using them we present several optimization criteria for our proposed <b>synchronization,</b> <b>channel</b> estimation, and equalization. The effectiveness of our proposed methods and optimization criteria are confirmed by computer simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{new code}} {{synchronization}} {{algorithm is proposed}} in this paper for the secondary cell-search stage in wideband CDMA systems. Rather than using the Cyclically Permutable (CP) code in the Secondary <b>Synchronization</b> <b>Channel</b> (S-SCH) to simultaneously determine the frame boundary and scrambling code group, the new synchronization algorithm implements the same function with less system complexity and less Mean Acquisition Time (MAT). The Secondary Synchronization Code (SSC) is redesigned by splitting into two sub-sequences. We treat the information of scrambling code group as data bits and use simple time diversity BCH coding for further reliability. It avoids involved and time-costly Reed-Solomon (RS) code computations and comparisons. Analysis and simulation {{results show that the}} Synchronization Error Rate (SER) yielded by the new algorithm in Rayleigh fading channels is close to that of the conventional algorithm in the standard. This new synchronization algorithm reduces system complexities, shortens the average cell-search time and can be implemented in the slot-based cell-search pipeline. By taking antenna diversity and pipelining correlation processes, the new algorithm also shows its flexible application in multiple antenna systems.

40|$|The {{performance}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is known to}} be highly sensitive to synchronization errors at the receiver. Inaccurate <b>synchronization</b> can increase <b>channel</b> estimation errors which further degrade OFDM performance. While effective independent synchronization techniques exist, performance gains can be expected by jointly estimating all <b>synchronization</b> errors and <b>channel</b> parameters. The research presented in this thesis aims to improve the {{performance of}} <b>synchronization</b> and <b>channel</b> estimation in burst mode OFDM systems by employing the non-linear recursive least squares algorithm (NL-RLS) to perform joint <b>synchronization</b> and <b>channel</b> estimation. This thesis presents two joint <b>synchronization</b> and <b>channel</b> estimation algorithms. The joint carrier-frequency-offset and channel estimation and compensation algorithm (CFOCE-C) is first presented and possible applications are discussed. The Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the efficiency of the estimator by measurement of its variance. Simulation is used to evaluate the advantage of the time domain approach used by the CFOCE-C in a typical burst mode system and a 2 dB gain in system performance is observed over an alternative joint frequency domain approach. The sensitivity of the CFOCE-C algorithm to sampling frequency offset (SFO) motivates the development of a second technique: the joint carrier-frequency-offset, sampling-frequency-offset, and channel estimation and compensation algorithm (CFOSFOCE-C). The variance of this estimator is also compared to the CRLB. A gain of 1. 5 dB is observed in comparison to a joint estimation algorithm that uses a frequency domain approach...|$|R
