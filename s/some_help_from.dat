The collection was announced on October 14, 2013, exclusively for the PlayStation 3. As with HD 1.5 Remix, the collection was developed mainly by the Square Enix 1st Production Department in Osaka, along with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Square Enix's Tokyo team.

5|$|Vermigli's {{move away}} from {{orthodox}} Catholic belief became apparent in 1539 when he preached on 1 Corinthians 3:9–17, a passage commonly used as proof {{of the doctrine of}} purgatory. Vermigli did not take this view in his preaching, though he did not openly deny the existence of purgatory. Gaetano da Thiene, an opponent of the spirituali, reported his suspicions of Vermigli to the Spanish viceroy of Naples Don Pedro de Toledo, who prohibited Vermigli's preaching. The prohibition was removed on Vermigli's appeal to Rome, with which he received <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> powerful friends he had made in Padua, such as Cardinals Pole and Bembo. Despite this controversy, Vermigli continued to rise in the Lateran Congregation. He was made one of four visitors by the chapter-general in 1540. The visitors assisted the rector general by inspecting the Congregation's religious houses.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E

25|$|The {{expedition}} {{began to}} organise itself on 16 March 1732, {{in the port}} of Alicante. The person responsible for {{the preparation of the}} expedition was the Prince of Campo Florido, Captain-General and Governor of the Kingdom of Valencia.

At the time, the city received most of its merchandise via the port, with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> nearby towns and cities, but finally the supply to the city was a success.|$|E

The Spanish assault, carried out by 14,000 regular infantry and 6,000 provincial militia, failed to break the French defenders, who received <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Pérignon's division in the center. Sauret's defenses, on the eastern flank, were not threatened.|$|E
25|$|The former {{territories of}} Volga Bulgaria (Kazan Ulus or Kazan Duchy) may have regained {{a degree of}} {{independence}} within the disintegrating Golden Horde {{by the turn of}} the 15th century.

Whatever the status of this proto-state, the founder of the khanate was Ulugh Muhammad, who assumed the title of khan and usurped the throne of Kazan with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> local nobility in 1437 or 1438. It has been suggested that the transfer of power from the local Bolgar dynasty to Muhammad was finalized by his son Maxmud in 1445.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Italy {{joined the}} Axis Powers, {{and used the}} Dodecanese as a naval staging area for its {{invasion}} of Crete in 1940. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the Germans, British and the Italians (the Dodecanese Campaign). The Germans prevailed, and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied {{until the end of}} the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was deported and killed. Only 1200 of these Ladino-speaking Jews survived, thanks to their lucky escape to the nearby coast of Turkey with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> the Italian colonists of Rhodes. In the Treaty of Paris in 1947, the islands were ceded to Greece.|$|E
25|$|Although the PSP/PLA and LCP/Popular Guard {{joined forces}} with Amal in {{defeating}} the Al-Mourabitoun, they remained militarily neutral {{in the fight against}} the PLO. Despite prodding from Syria, these political parties and their respective militias contributed nothing more than verbally expressing support for Amal and demanding that Arafat step down. The PSP/PLA even allowed the PLO to station their artillery on Druze-controlled areas. This left Amal to do the work of dislodging the Arafat loyalists, with <b>some</b> <b>help</b> <b>from</b> Syria's anti-Arafat Palestinian allies, such as As-Sa'iqa, PFLP-GC and Fatah al-Intifada. The alliance between Amal and most of the pro-Syrian Palestinian groups eventually soured however, and clashes would later break out between them. While some dissident Palestinian commanders such as Ahmed Jibril and Abu Musa still supported Amal against the PLO, many anti-Arafat fighters battled Amal in defense of the camps.|$|E
