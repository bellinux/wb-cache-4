5|$|Most natural {{resources}} were easily {{available in the}} immediate vicinity of the city. The nearby port at La Trinidad de Nosotros was an important hub for the import of exotic goods and export of local products such as chert and ceramics. Other goods not immediately available were likely to have been provided by the cityâ€™s satellite sites. The local area provided a number of different soils suitable for varied agricultural use, and the port at La Trinidad de Nosotros provided the city with freshwater products such as turtles, crocodiles and freshwater molluscs. Deer were hunted locally and provided an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> for the upper class, while freshwater snails were the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> for commoners.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network {{had been reduced to}} air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein)</b> had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E

5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
50|$|Whole {{grains and}} cereals are another <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, these {{tend to be}} {{limiting}} in the amino acid lysine or threonine, which are available in other vegetarian sources and meats.

5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials {{were used to}} construct outrigger canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E
5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E

Copepods are a group of small crustaceans found in ocean and freshwater habitats. They are the biggest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> in the sea, and are important prey for forage fish. Krill constitute the next biggest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton.

50|$|Vegetarian <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> include legumes, nuts, {{seeds and}} fruits. Legumes, {{some of which}} are called pulses in certain parts of the world, have higher {{concentrations}} of amino acids and are more complete <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> than whole grains and cereals. Examples of vegetarian foods with protein concentrations greater than 7 percent include soybeans, lentils, kidney beans, white beans, mung beans, chickpeas, cowpeas, lima beans, pigeon peas, lupines, wing beans, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, walnuts, cotton seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.Food staples that are poor <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> include roots and tubers such as yams, cassava and sweet potato. Plantains, another major staple, are also a poor <b>source</b> <b>of</b> essential amino acids. Fruits, while rich in other essential nutrients, are another poor <b>source</b> <b>of</b> amino acids. The protein content in roots, tubers and fruits is between 0 and 2 percent. Food staples with low protein content must be complemented with foods with complete, quality protein content for a healthy life, particularly in children for proper development.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{represents}} a review {{work on the}} different animal and plant <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> supplements for growing calves, comparative nutrient degradabilities and difference in growth and reproductive performances of calves fed with those protein supplements.

There are many possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>protein</b> for livestock rations. These include oilseeds, by-products of food production, arable and forage legumes. Animal origin protein supplements in general have better composition and balance of amino acids compared with plant origin <b>proteins.</b> Higher level <b>of</b> rumen undegradable intake <b>protein</b> fractions <b>of</b> animal <b>sourced</b> <b>proteins</b> has been demonstrated.
