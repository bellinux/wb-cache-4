25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was under}} construction when the minister, Duncan Sandys, announced {{the decision to}} cancel its development in 1957. It had been suspected {{that by the time}} the aircraft came into service a decade later, by which time it was anticipated {{that it would have been}} vulnerable to Soviet advances in anti-aircraft missile technology. Effort was instead transferred to the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile instead, while the sole 730 test fuselage was cut up. The Bristol 188 project continued despite the cancellation of the 730. Aspects and influences of the Avro 730 encouraged studies at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, into <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which in turn eventually contributed to the development effort behind Concorde.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Joe Sutter was {{transferred}} from Boeing's 737 development team {{to manage the}} design studies for the new airliner, already assigned the model number 747. Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Boeing responded by designing the 747 {{so that it could}} be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard containers are [...] square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in [...] lengths. This meant that {{it would be possible to}} support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.|$|E
2500|$|Partial {{internal}} compression {{was considered}} for the Concorde (the <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Committee, in 1959, had recommended an SST to cruise at Mach2.2) but an [...] "external configuration was chosen for the inherent stability of its shock system, it had no unstart mode". However, there was some internal compression terminated by a normal shock local to the ramp boundary layer bleed slot inside the intake. but Leyman states that the intake was aerodynamically self-compensating with no trace of any unstart problem. Early {{in the development of}} the B-1 Lancer its mixed external/internal intake was changed to an external one, technically safer but with a small compromise in cruise speed. and subsequently had fixed intakes to reduce complexity, weight and cost.|$|E
