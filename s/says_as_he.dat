2500|$|The {{incident}} involving Palmer at {{the autopsy}} of Cook {{is referred to}} in Dorothy L. Sayers's murder mystery novel The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club. The doctor doing the post-mortem on the victim <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> transfers the stomach contents to a jar: [...] "...Look out! You'll have it over. Ha! ha! That was a near thing. Reminds me of Palmer, you know - and Cook's stomach - always think that a very funny story, ha! ha!..." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{style of}} argumentation is what Chesterton {{refers to as}} using 'Uncommon Sense' – that is, that the thinkers and popular {{philosophers}} of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in Orthodoxy: [...] "Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'." [...] Or, again from Orthodoxy: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Smallweed, good morning!" [...] he <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> comes in. [...] "You {{have brought}} the sergeant, I see. Sit down, sergeant." ...|$|E
60|$|The last of {{the three}} now said his <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> put down his empty {{drinking}} vessel and smacked his lips.|$|R
60|$|Instead of <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> meant her to say, {{that she}} wished to see them, she said nothing for some time.|$|R
60|$|Gregory's advent set {{an awkward}} {{constraint}} upon them, nor had he any word to <b>say</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came heavily up the hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "The displeasure of {{your grace}} {{is worse than}} death," [...] he <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> takes his {{overcoat}} and hat from {{a corner of the}} mantelpiece and leaves the room.|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet there}} was some'at {{remarkable}} grand-- [...] And the editor <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> looks: [...] "Your Height" [...] (it was Highness, you understand, [...] That he meant, but he spoke like books)-- ...|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON (exasperated, clasps {{his hands}} behind him, his fingers twitching, and <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walks irritably away from her to the fireplace). This woman will drive {{me out of my}} senses. (To her.) Begone.|$|E
6000|$|When she {{had gone}} the talk flagged, and {{presently}} d'Aguilar asked for his men and horses and departed also, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went: ...|$|R
5000|$|One time {{he heard}} a voice behind him <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was {{stepping}} over a poncho-covered heap, [...] "Hey, Mac, watch that dead Marine." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Eph {{quoted from}} the book, Seth planted himself before Tilly, {{with the long}} poker in his hand, <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> flourished it valiantly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my lady. There {{has been}} ever {{so much about}} it. My lord <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> won't sit down to dinner with Mr. Greenwood on no account, and Mr. Roberts has been here, all about it. He's to be turned away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{if it is}} {{said that}} this is a forgery, we will open the paper here and see whether it is or not. Again, Trumbull <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> goes along, that Mr. Bigler made the {{following}} statement in his place in the Senate, December 9, 1857: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We's both worried, Ethel. Our time's come, an' no mistake. Peggy McNutt <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had real}} orders to turn Hucks {{out if he}} was a married man; an' there's no disclaimin' he's married, is there? Peggy's a kind man, an' tol' us to keep stayin' 'til the nabobs arrove. Then I guess we'll git our walkin'-papers, mighty quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{commodore}} ran on deck, {{hailed the}} guard-boat, spoke {{a few words}} in a low tone, and returned to us, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so: ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pleads {{against the}} adversary, so he enlargeth himself with {{arguments}} over and besides those which he pleadeth with God his Father.|$|R
6000|$|And {{after that}} I {{can imagine the}} {{audience}} dispersing, and the now educated children going off to their homes and one <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> enters-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall all {{leave for}} Paris to-morrow, {{as early as}} possible," [...] he <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> finally takes leave of the General and the préfet, [...] "and take the money with us, of course. If the King--which God forbid!--is obliged to leave Paris, it will be most {{acceptable}} to him, until {{the day when the}} allies are once more in the field and ready to crush, irretrievably this time, this Corsican scourge of Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{now they}} have {{let me come back}} to my Jock, and I see visibly his improvement. He holds out his hand, and he smiles, and he speaks now and then, the dreadful oppression is gone, and all the {{dangerous}} symptoms are abating, and I cannot tell how happy and thankful we are. 'Send my love, and tell Sydney she has a blessed Monk,' he <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wakes, and sees me writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what sudden {{noise is}} that he hears within the house? Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs? What feet are they which are so busy in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my aunt!' he <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> leans against the banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my aunt!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{merchant}} {{turned to the}} would-be fakir and asked for further particulars, which were readily given, the latter <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> finished the sad story: ...|$|R
6000|$|Under such climatic {{conditions}} the meat would not keep sweet many hours, and Poyor set the entire stock before his companions, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Appleyard"--the {{newcomer}} was <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> entered; but {{he stopped}} dead. [...] "Ave Maria!" [...] he cried. [...] "Saints be our shield! What cheer is this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there is}} the {{opposite}} attack on thought: that urged by Mr. H.G.Wells when he insists that every separate thing is [...] "unique," [...] {{and there are no}} categories at all. This also is merely destructive. Thinking means connecting things, and stops if they cannot be connected. It need hardly be said that this scepticism forbidding thought necessarily forbids speech; a man cannot open his mouth without contradicting it. Thus when Mr. Wells <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> did somewhere), [...] "All chairs are quite different," [...] he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them [...] "all chairs." ...|$|E
60|$|The news is here of {{the capture}} by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and very {{important}} thing. General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from Richmond, has talked with me this morning. He was there when our cavalry cut the roads in that vicinity. He says {{there was not a}} sound pair of legs in Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely gone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis. We captured and paroled 300 or 400 men. He <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to City Point there was an army three miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond.|$|E
60|$|And, lastly, if he <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> most {{certainly}} will) that these transformations only {{take place in}} the lower animals, and not in the higher, say that that seems to little boys, and to some grown people, a very strange fancy. For if the changes of the lower animals are so wonderful, and so difficult to discover, why should not there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful, and far more difficult to discover? And may not man, the crown and flower of all things, undergo some change as much more wonderful than all the rest, as the Great Exhibition is more wonderful than a rabbit-burrow? Let him answer that. And if he <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> will) that not having seen such a change in his experience, he is not bound to believe it, ask him respectfully, where his microscope has been? Does not each of us, in coming into this world, go through a transformation just as wonderful as that of a sea-egg, or a butterfly? and do not reason and analogy, as well as Scripture, tell us that that transformation is not the last? and that, though what we shall be, we know not, yet we are here but as the crawling caterpillar, and shall be hereafter as the perfect fly. The old Greeks, heathens as they were, saw as much as that two thousand years ago; and I care very little for Cousin Cramchild, if he sees even less than they. And so forth, and so forth, till he is quite cross. And then tell him that if there are no water-babies, at least there ought to be; and that, at least, he cannot answer.|$|E
6000|$|The {{shepherd}} {{filled and}} handed him a new clay pipe, <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so, 'Hand me your baccy-box--I'll fill that too, now I am about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mither!" [...] was {{all that}} Andrew could <b>say</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> grasped them, fell on his knees, and, with a {{profound}} sigh, laid his head upon her lap.|$|R
6000|$|Twice he loaded his revolver, {{and twice}} {{exploded}} every cartridge before the surgical work was done, and then Jim seized his own weapon, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so: ...|$|R
60|$|After {{a little}} {{conversation}} about the wretchedness of {{the weather and the}} merits of tea, with a digression relative to the viciousness of boys as a rule, and the amiability of Master Peplow as an exception, Mrs. Walker sees her husband coming down the street; and as he must want his tea, poor man, after his dirty walk from the Docks, she instantly runs across, muffins in hand, and Mrs. Macklin does the same, and after a few words to Mrs. Walker, they all pop into their little houses, and slam their little street-doors, which are not opened again {{for the remainder of the}} evening, except to the nine o’clock ‘beer,’ who comes round with a lantern in front of his tray, and <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lends Mrs. Walker ‘Yesterday’s ‘Tiser,’ that he’s blessed if he can hardly hold the pot, much less feel the paper, for it’s one of the bitterest nights he ever felt, ’cept the night when the man was frozen to death in the Brick-field.|$|E
6000|$|... "However, he's a good-natured old gentleman," [...] said John, [...] "and pays as a gentleman, and I {{think his}} word {{is to be}} relied upon, like a gentleman's. I had quite a long talk with him this morning: he can hear me better already, he <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gets more used to my voice. He told {{me a great deal}} about himself, and I told him a good deal about myself, and a rare lot of {{questions}} he asked me. I gave him information about my having two beats, you know, in my business; one day to the right from our house and back again; another day to the left from our house and back again (for he's a stranger, and don't know the names of places about here); and he seemed quite pleased. 'Why, then I shall be returning home to-night your way,' he says, 'when I thought you'd be coming in an exactly opposite direction. That's capital! I may trouble you for another lift, perhaps, but I'll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.' He was sound asleep, sure-ly!--Dot! what are you thinking of?" ...|$|E
60|$|How {{many people}} in all, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, {{and one or two}} {{intimate}} friends of the family, dine together to-day at the eldest son's to congratulate the old couple, and wish them many happy returns, is a calculation beyond our powers; but this we know, that the old couple no sooner present themselves, very sprucely and carefully attired, than there is a violent shouting and rushing forward of the younger branches with all manner of presents, such as pocket-books, pencil-cases, pen-wipers, watch- papers, pin-cushions, sleeve-buckles, worked-slippers, watch- guards, and even a nutmeg-grater: the latter article being presented by a very chubby and very little boy, who exhibits it in great triumph as an extraordinary variety. The old couple's emotion at these tokens of remembrance occasions quite a pathetic scene, of which the chief ingredients are a vast quantity of kissing and hugging, and repeated wipings of small eyes and noses with small square pocket-handkerchiefs, which don't come at all easily out of small pockets. Even the peevish bachelor is moved, and he <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> presents the old gentleman with a queer sort of antique ring from his own finger, that he'll be de'ed if he doesn't think he looks younger than he did ten years ago.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{he could}} drop the {{document}} {{from his fingers}} Sewatis leaped from his couch, seized the warrant, {{and went back to}} his slumbers, <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|So Wulf set {{his foot}} upon the breast of the lion and tugged and tugged until at length he {{loosened}} the sword, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> strained at it: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Appleyard," [...] the {{newcomer}} was <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> entered, {{but he stopped}} dead. [...] "Ave Maria!" [...] he cried. [...] "Saints be our shield! What cheer is this?" ...|$|R
