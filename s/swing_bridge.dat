5|$|The James F. Byrnes Bridge {{was built}} in 1956. It was a two-lane toll <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> {{constructed}} {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million that opened the island to automobile traffic from the mainland. The <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> was hit by a barge in 1974 which shut down all vehicle traffic to the island until the Army Corps of Engineers built and manned a pontoon bridge while the bridge was being repaired. The <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> was replaced by the current four-lane bridge in 1982.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the <b>Swing</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the <b>Swing</b> <b>Bridge,</b> forcing it to close for the rest of that weekend.|$|E
5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel <b>swing</b> <b>bridge,</b> the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This <b>swing</b> <b>bridge,</b> which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>swing</b> <b>bridges,</b> Hayhurst Bridge {{built in}} 1898, and Town Bridge built in 1899, cross the Weaver at Northwich. The bridges {{were the first}} two {{electrically}} powered <b>swing</b> <b>bridges</b> in Great Britain and were built on floating pontoons to counteract the mine subsidence. They were designed by Colonel John Saner.|$|R

5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bridge}} is built on a gravel bed covered by {{shifting}} sand. The north end by the <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> section is next to the rock of Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built directly onto the rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighborhoods that}} make up West Seattle are on a {{peninsula}} separated from downtown by the Duwamish River. The West Seattle Bridge is the primary roadway crossing the river. The neighborhood's Spokane Street Bridge is the world's first and only hydraulically operated concrete double-leaf <b>swing</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{segment of}} the path connected the Lost Lake to the Patapsco <b>Swinging</b> <b>Bridge</b> in the Avalon area of the park. In 2006, the trail was expanded to Ilchester Road, where a second <b>swinging</b> <b>bridge</b> was built as a connection. All together, the Grist Mill Trail travels from River Road in Relay, Maryland to Ilchester Road/River Road in Ellicott City, Maryland.|$|R
5|$|The <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> {{spanning}} the Esk divides {{the upper and}} lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made of cast iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric <b>swing</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Notable German burials include Musketier Oskar Niemeyer {{from the}} 84th Infantry Regiment {{was the first}} {{recipient}} of the Iron Cross during the war. Having come to a crossing of the Mons–Condé canal with a closed <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> he swam across the canal, returned across the canal with a requisitioned small boat, paddled back across the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers. He was killed shortly after opening the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced by the current <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{lift bridge}} {{is the last}} of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> was built in 1875. A newer, iron <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} locks and bridges in Hungerford, {{including}} one which carries the A338. Hungerford Marsh Lock is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal {{in that it}} has a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge,</b> which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was damaged}} by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot vertical lift bridge in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E
5|$|North of Welland, Highway58 {{initially}} travelled concurrent with Highway3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway20, where Highway3A ended. Highway58 turned {{east and}} travelled concurrent with Highway20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg, before turning north onto the current route. However, it continued north along Allanburg Road into Thorold, where it crossed the Welland Canal on a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street, Merritt Street and Hartzel Road (Niagara Regional Road52) to Highway8 (Queenston Street, now Niagara Regional Road81).|$|E

5|$|The 50 or so {{crossings}} of the Willamette River include many historic structures, {{such as the}} Van Buren Street Bridge, a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge.</b> Built in 1913, it carries Oregon Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM131 (RK211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The Oregon City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888. It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM26 (RK42) between Oregon City and West Linn.|$|E
5|$|The A82 {{continues}} {{at the north}} end of the loch, along the western edge of the River Ness, which runs parallel alongside the canal towards Inverness city centre. Immediately after entering the urban area, the road crosses the canal at the Tomnahurich <b>Swing</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Now inside Inverness, the road passes Queen's Park stadium and heads towards the city centre. It crosses the Ness at the Friar's Bridge, bypassing the city centre to pass through the docklands and associated industrial estates as an urban dual carriageway. The road ends at a roundabout with the A9 just south of Kessock Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The A82 runs {{towards the}} centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 {{continues}} along the western shore of the loch up to the Bridge of Oich at its northern end. This bridge was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade's Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at a <b>swing</b> <b>bridge</b> next to the locks in the village.|$|E
