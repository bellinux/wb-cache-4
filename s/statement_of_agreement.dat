Preference rankings usually {{depend on the}} characteristics of both the individuals judging a set of objects and the objects being judged. This theme has been handled in the literature with log-linear representations of the generalized Bradley-Terry model. Tree-based models working with multivariate response variables are present in the literature. The problem with preference rankings is that an ordering can be considered as a unique multidimensional ”entity” rather than a multivariate distribution. For this reason the techniques known in the literature to define split for multivariate response variables are not able to obtain impurity measures which are feasible in this case. This tree-based model works with a spitting criterion based on the minimization of a suitable distance for rankings. In the framework of preference rankings theory, often on discuss about the meaning of ties: who believes that ties are a positive <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> and not just indifference declarations, should accept a set of four axioms formulated by Kemeny: these axioms should be verified in the definition of a distance measure involving preference rankings.

The problem with preference rankings is that an ordering can be considered as a unique multidimensional ”entity” rather than a multivariate distribution. For this reason the techniques known in the literature to deﬁne split for multivariate response variables are not able to obtain impurity measures which are feasible in this case. Building a tree-based structure with rankings as response variable requires the definition of both a particular impurity measure and an assignment rule: the goodness of the tree-based classifier for rankings depends on this choice. In defining the impurity measure, in this paper we use a distance-based approach. In the framework of preference rankings theory, often on discuss about the meaning of ties: who believes that ties are a positive <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> and not just indifference declarations, should accept a set axioms formulated by Kemeny (Kemeny, 1964) that should be verified in the definition of a distance measure involving preference rankings. But some experimental design could not contemplate ties. We chose the Kemeny distance as impurity measure because it is sufficiently discriminatory to be used for splitting measure. Moreover, if in some experimental design ties are not allowed, it is proved that it is equivalent to the well known Kendall distance. The problem in using the latter distance is that it can be used only with linear orderings (i. e. when ties are not allowed). Otherwise it can be proved that Kendall distance violates the triangular inequality. The ranking-class assignment rule is the consensus ranking computed by maximizing the Emond and Mason’s rank correlation coefficient (Emond and Mason, 2002). The characterization of the impurity measure suggested us to call our method Distance Based Multivariate Trees for Rankings (DBMTR) ...|$|E

This paper examines the influence of low-level visual and auditory cues on the communication <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> disagreement, and the ability to convince others. In addition, we investigate whether the judgment of these attitudes depends on ratings of socio-emotional dimensions such as dominance, arousal, and valence. The material we used consisted of audio–video excerpts that represent <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> and disagreement, as well as neutral utterances taken from political discussions. Each excerpt was rated on a number <b>of</b> dimensions: <b>agreement,</b> disagreement, dominance, valence, arousal, and convincing power in three rating conditions: audio-only, video-only, and audio–video. We extracted low-level dynamic visual features using optical flow. Auditory features consisted of pitch measurements, vocal intensity, and articulation rate. Results show that judges were able to distinguish <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> disagreement from <b>agreement</b> and neutral utterances on the basis of nonverbal cues alone, in particular, when both auditory and visual information were present. Visual features were more influential when presented along with auditory features.

A feminist post-structural methodology using comparative reflexive practice is employed to explore the experiences and challenges of non-Indigenous Learning Advisors in their work giving assistance to Indigenous Students. Using a reflective narrative writing style, the collective experiences of the research partners are allowed to emerge in order to make the most of an opportunity for the small collective voice to be heard. As such, the emergence of patterns in stories of shared experience permits a powerful contribution to the growing pool of research in the area of teaching and learning from Indigenous perspectives. The stories of shared experience of research partners are set against the background of Australia's oppressive colonial history; and include the examination of social policy both at the govemmentallevel and CQUniversity's own agreement with Nulloo Yumbah. This <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> aims to provide appropriate and cultural support to Indigenous tertiary students in line with the stipulations outlined in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy 1989, which are to increase the outcomes for Indigenous tertiary students to reflect the same standard of achievement as other Australians. The objective of the research project is made possible by the use of reflexive practice, where the writer/researcher challenges the efficacy of university support systems by taking the stance of an insider, deeply embedded in the dominant colonial educational discourse present in Australia. Additionally, this approach enables not only an understanding of the experiences of the actors, being non-Indigenous learning advisors and Indigenous tertiary students, within educational support systems, but also depicts how these experiences might compare with broader social expectations and intent for the functions of the existing education system...|$|E
40|$|Walther Kohler {{ended his}} classic {{account of the}} eucharistic controversy, Zwingli und Luther, with a {{description}} of the synod of Swiss theologians that met in Zurich in April of 1538. Held almost two years after the signing of the Wittenberg Concord, the synod was Martin Bucer 2 ̆ 7 s last opportunity to persuade the Swiss to continue negotiations for eucharistic concord with Luther. Bucer had reason to hope for positive results from the synod, for {{at least some of the}} Swiss were open to further discussion. The delegates from Basel, Bern, St. Gall, and Mulhouse supported a favorable response to a recent letter from Luther on the issue, while Schaffhausen 2 ̆ 7 s instructions told them to remain neutral. Only Zurich and Biel opposed an open <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> with Luther. Nevertheless, Zurich 2 ̆ 7 s determined opposition was sufficient to win the day. The synod resolved to send a friendly letter to Luther but refused to continue discussions concerning the sacrament. Bucer 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to reconcile the Lutherans and the Swiss had failed, and the breach between the two parties on the Lord 2 ̆ 7 s Supper would not be mended. As Kohler put it, 2 ̆ 2 Concord with the Swiss had foundered. 2 ̆ 2 Ernst Bizer used the same metaphor in his description of the synod, concluding more pointedly that 2 ̆ 2 the concord foundered on the Zwinglianism of the Swiss. 2 ̆ 2 The Zurich synod thus marked the end of Bucer 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to win the Swiss to the cause of eucharistic agreement. This does not mean, however, that those efforts had no long-lasting impact in Switzerland. In fact, Bucer had already achieved a notable triumph in Basel. In the wake of the Wittenberg Concord, the leader of Basel 2 ̆ 7 s church, Oswald Myconius, became one of Bucer 2 ̆ 7 s most loyal defenders and disciples in Switzerland. His adoption of Bucer 2 ̆ 7 s eucharistic theology put Basel on a path that would eventually lead to accusations of 2 ̆ 2 Lutheranizing 2 ̆ 2 and to the distancing of that city 2 ̆ 7 s church from those of its Swiss allies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{argues that}} QCA is a {{suitable}} methodological {{choice for the}} analysis of a specific but widely used form of large-N data in the social sciences, namely survey data collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews or internet surveys. The reason is that the linguistic form of survey data often lends itself to a direct translation into fuzzy sets. Likert-scaled survey items let respondents make qualitative <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> disagreement and indifference. Fuzzy sets can capture these qualitative differences in a way that classical interval-scaled indicators cannot. Moreover, fuzzy algebra allows researchers to combine multiple sets in a simple and transparent manner, thereby giving QCA an important advantage over regression-based approaches. However, the analysis of large-N survey data removes one of the characteristic strengths of QCA: its case orientation. In the case of large-N survey data, the case orientation is typically weak and causal inference thus questionable. To remedy this shortcoming QCA methodologists have suggested robustness tests to enhance confidence in the proposed relationships. This paper shows how these robustness tests {{can be used in a}} large-N setting and suggests a new robustness test that is particularly suited for large-N survey data...|$|R

No attempt {{has been made to}} assess consensus among internationally recognized experts in this field. Aim To identify areas of consensus and dissent among international experts on a broad range of issues pertaining to the practice of sedation in digestive endoscopy. Methods Thirty-two position statements were reviewed during a 1 -day meeting. Thirty-two individuals from 12 countries and four continents, representing the fields of gastroenterology, anaesthesiology and medical jurisprudence heard evidence-based presentations on each <b>statement.</b> Level <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> among the experts for each statement was determined by an open poll. Results The principle recommendations included the following: (i) sedation improves patient tolerance and compliance for endoscopy, (ii) whenever possible, patients undergoing endoscopy should be offered the option of having the procedure either with or without sedation, (iii) monitoring of vital signs as well as the levels of consciousness and paindiscomfort should be performed routinely during endoscopy, and (iv) endoscopists and nurses with appropriate training can safely and effectively administer propofol to low-risk patients undergoing endoscopic procedures.
