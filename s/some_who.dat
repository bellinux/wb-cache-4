5|$|Bristol in {{the early}} 1960s had an {{estimated}} 3,000 residents of West Indian origin, <b>some</b> <b>who</b> {{had served in the}} British military during World War II and <b>some</b> <b>who</b> had emigrated to Britain more recently. A large number lived in the area around City Road in St Pauls. They suffered discrimination in housing and employment, and some encountered violence from Teddy Boy gangs of white British youths. This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a representative body.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their European stops, Armstrong saw a {{willingness}} among <b>some</b> <b>who</b> {{were looking for}} a life change to consider emigrating to Hawaii as plantation labor.

5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela.

5|$|Hensley {{continued}} to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception {{from those who}} were aware of his past. <b>Some</b> <b>who</b> knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family.

5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} top half of their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including <b>some</b> <b>who</b> finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters.

The Loyalists were organized as Butler's Rangers, a Loyalist militia in the British Army, led by Colonel John Butler and his son, Captain Walter Butler.

5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was {{practiced by}} some Bábís. It was {{justified}} {{by some as}} a response to the often violent oppression the community faced.

5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among <b>some</b> <b>who</b> were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E
5|$|The scheme did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were <b>some</b> <b>who</b> doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient {{where there was no}} leeway (most observers being oblivious to the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert was {{instrumental}} in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books {{to be found in}} Europe outside of Rome. Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon. Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we know that he visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including <b>some</b> <b>who</b> wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.|$|E
