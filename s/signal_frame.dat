On the north-west elevation {{there is only a}} centrally positioned timber panelled door. The building has a suspended timber floor elevated above the platform level. Concrete walls to floor level support the concrete plank walls above. The single internal space has a painted timber ceiling and contains a McKenzie and Holland 37-lever mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b> Significant elements of the interlocked signalling system include the <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> and its mechanism, plus all linkages, points, points indicators and signal towers located around the station yard.|$|E
25|$|The main {{elements}} of Kuranda Station which {{contribute to an}} understanding of the how the complex functioned include the concrete main station building, its platform and garden beds; the concrete male toilet block; the concrete signal cabin with its associated mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frame,</b> linkages, semaphore signal towers, points, and points indicators; the goods shed; the trolley shed; the Station Master's residence; and the turntable.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coordinate}} signals {{so that it}} {{is impossible}} to give a [...] "clear" [...] signal to a train unless the route is actually clear, the signals could be interlocked. An interlocked yard is a railway yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled in such a way that the signals will not allow a train to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device, located under a mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frame,</b> is a system of rods, sliding bars and levers that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|E

50|$|Ascot {{railway station}} {{is the last}} station in {{metropolitan}} Brisbane to retain semaphore signalling and a mechanically interlocked signal cabin, {{and is one of}} only seven such systems intact in Queensland. In 2008 the seven mechanically interlocked signal cabins still commissioned were Ascot (not used), Charters Towers, Ingham, Innisfail, Kuranda, Laidley (rarely used) and Mackay. There are about 19 surviving decommissioned interlocked signal cabins complete with their frames in Queensland (six have been relocated), along with 36 signal cabins minus their <b>signal</b> <b>frames,</b> and 10 known <b>signal</b> <b>frames</b> in various states of intactness. Approximately 100 mechanically interlocked signal cabins have been demolished at stations around Queensland.|$|R
2500|$|The {{signal cabin}} {{included}} a fully interlocking McKenzie and Holland 37-lever mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> (still extant). Before railway [...] "safeworking" [...] systems were computerised and centralised in Queensland, mechanical signals were controlled from signal cabins, which {{dealt with the}} traffic on a particular block of railway line. Signal cabins coordinated signals that indicated {{whether or not a}} section of track was clear of other traffic. Early signals were mechanical, while later signals were operated electrically. The most common form of mechanical signal was the semaphore signal. These consisted of a metal framed tower with one or more arms that could be inclined at different angles, with the arm at the horizontal signalling [...] "danger", or do not proceed. Examples of this form of signalling system survive at Kuranda Station. At night, lights were necessary, and kerosene lamps with movable coloured spectacles displayed different colours, including green (proceed), yellow (prepare to find next signal red), and red (stop).|$|E

50|$|Although most of Queensland's railway {{signalling}} {{is controlled}} by computers, the interlocking system at Charters Towers is still controlled from a McKenzie and Holland low-level duplex tappet <b>signal</b> <b>frame,</b> numbered 21, which was manufactured in Melbourne. Its underfloor mechanism uses the duplex tappet system, with 5 inches between levers, similar to the frame at Ascot railway station in Brisbane, whereas the frame at the Kuranda Railway Station uses t-bar interlocking. The current 20-lever <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> manipulates the points and signals of the station. Warning bells sound as a train approaches the station, and staff set the required levers to guide a train through the station or into a siding. The levers operate the points either manually, by long metal pull rods, or by activating an electric motor to change the points, while the semaphore signals are controlled by wires connected to the <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b> Electric light signals and crossing lights are also operated from the <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|In linear algebra, a {{frame of}} an inner product space is a {{generalization}} of a basis of a vector space to sets that may be linearly dependent. In the terminology of <b>signal</b> processing, a <b>frame</b> provides a redundant, stable way of representing a <b>signal.</b> <b>Frames</b> are used in error detection and correction and the design and analysis of filter banks and more generally in applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering.|$|R
5000|$|Twelve DS1 frames make up {{a single}} T1 Superframe (T1 SF). Each T1 Superframe is {{composed}} of two <b>signaling</b> <b>frames.</b> All T1 DS0 channels that employ in-band signaling will have its eighth bit over written, or [...] "robbed" [...] from the full 64 kbit/s DS0 payload, by either a logical ZERO or ONE bit to signify a circuit signaling state or condition. Hence robbed bit signaling will restrict a DS0 channel to a rate of only 56 kbit/s during two of the twelve DS1 frames that {{make up a}} T1 SF framed circuit. T1 SF framed circuits yield two independent signaling channels (A&B) T1 ESF <b>framed</b> circuits four <b>signaling</b> <b>frames</b> in a twenty four frame extended frame format that yield four independent signaling channels (A, B, C, and D).|$|R

50|$|A metal key, in {{the shape}} of a small metal rod, can be removed from a lock {{attached}} to the <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b> This immobilises the <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> levers, and the key can be used to unlock a smaller mechanical ground frame to the north-east of the station. This key lockout system is rare. The ground frame at Charters Towers, north-east of the station, has two levers on a small metal platform, and is used to control access to a siding.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} at Drouin was closed in February 1988, with the block post abolished, all fixed signals covered and lights extinguished. The {{interlocked}} <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> was also abolished.|$|E

50|$|There are two signal poles {{north-east}} of the platform. These originally carried signal {{arms and}} kerosene lanterns, but they now display electrical lights. The lights {{at the level}} crossing are also controlled from the <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The fully {{interlocking}} McKenzie and Holland 20-lever mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> in {{the signal}} cabin at the Charters Towers Railway Station {{is a rare}} surviving example of an operational mechanical safety system for managing railway traffic. The levers on the <b>signal</b> <b>frame</b> work an underfloor interlocking mechanism which is linked to points (tapering rails, used to transfer the train from one set of tracks to another), points indicators, crossing lights and signals around the railway station. The signalling equipment is located {{both sides of the}} Gill Street crossing, and a 10-ton crane south-west of the crossing also remains as a reminder that Charters Towers was once a thriving gold-mining town.|$|E

50|$|This {{sequence}} {{would have}} had to occur in the time between the train passing the Home signal and running on to the track circuit, i.e. in less than two seconds. Tests were conducted using a similar <b>signalling</b> <b>frame</b> to the one at Connington South and it was found that an experienced signalman could just about manage to reproduce the sequence. Thus, it was shown that the interlocking could be defeated.|$|R
50|$|The {{modernisation}} {{work began}} {{in the summer of}} 2001, and lasted until the end of November 2003. Track 1, the locomotive shed dating from 1900, various other buildings and the tracks of the former goods depot were all taken out of service. The mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>frames</b> were replaced by a Siemens SIMIS C type electronic system, and therefore the signals and the manually operated barriers were also replaced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{apply the}} {{technique}} of independent component analysis to Fourier power coefficients of speech <b>signal</b> <b>frames</b> for a blind detection of basic vectors (sources). A subset of sources corresponding to the noisy influence of basic frequency is identified and its corresponding features could be eliminated. The mixing coefficients for such sources are then determined for every speech sample. We compare our features with the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) features, widely used today for phoneme-based speech recognition. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1920, the {{crossing}} loop at the Up {{end of the}} station was extended, and became known as Works Siding. The Ballast Siding became the new main running line in September 1922, and the old main line became a siding, which closed in early 1923. Automatic staff exchangers were provided around May 1927. A new station building was erected on in 1948, along with a new <b>signal</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interlocked}} {{signalling system}} is a good surviving example of how train safety was managed prior to the advent of computerised systems. Each aspect of the system, from the <b>signal</b> <b>frame's</b> levers and its key lock-out system, through its linkages to the various points, points indicators and signals, demonstrates the functioning of early signals technology and its safety mechanisms. The interlocking system enabled humans to mechanically manipulate the signals, while precluding the possibility of collisions caused by human error.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{question}} of which low-level acoustical features are the most adequate for identifying music beats computationally. We consider 172 features computed on consecutive <b>signal</b> <b>frames</b> and systematically evaluate their individual value in the task of providing reliable cues for the presence and localisation of beats in music signals. We compare two ways of evaluating features: their accuracy in a song-specific classification task (classifying beats vs nonbeats) and their performance as a front-end to a beat tracking system...|$|R
