5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the lead from Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a pit stop with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late pit <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E
5|$|Burnett and Loco <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> {{a frozen}} lake to allow Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, {{shooting}} the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving {{him to die}} in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence. Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut. Loco and his gang arrive to look for Silence, just as the outlaws appear {{at the edge of town}} to collect the provisions, having been previously advised to do so by Burnett. Deciding to use them to draw out Silence, the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline. Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him – if Silence wins, the outlaws will be set free; if he wins, they will be killed.|$|E

5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E

5|$|International {{airports}} sometimes serve {{military as}} well as commercial purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments. Canton Island Airport, for example, in the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), after serving as a military airport during World War II, {{was used as a}} refuelling <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> commercial aircraft such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s. The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non-stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii, meant that a mid-Pacific stop was no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use. Other international airports, such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandatory}} pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started on lap 17. Everyone came in at this point except the two NEXTEV TCR drivers Piquet and Charles Pic. D'Ambrosio managed {{to get ahead of}} Buemi into second place thanks to swift work from his crew. Piquet benefited from his late <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, the Cleveland Browns and the New York Yankees faced off in the AAFC {{championship}} game, this time on a cold December day at Yankee Stadium. The crowd of 61,879 was the largest ever to watch a professional football championship game. The Browns and Yankees had played to a 28–28 tie the previous month, but the championship game did not feature much scoring because of an icy field. The Browns scored a touchdown in the first quarter on a short run by Graham set up by a 51-yard run up the middle of the field by Motley. New York scored a field goal in the second quarter, but Jones ran for another touchdown in the third, and the Browns won 14–3. The slippery field made longer passes dangerous, and Graham instead relied on shorter routes, ending the game with 14 completions and 112 passing yards. Motley was a key performer for the Browns, running for 109 yards on 13 carries, including his touchdown. The Browns' defense, meanwhile, kept Spec Sanders and New York's offense in check. New York had just 13 first downs in the game and 212 total yards. A <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> the defense in the second quarter as the Yankees reached the Browns' five-yard line forced New York to kick its lone field goal. Tommy Colella added an interception in the third quarter to stop another New York drive. Sanders had just 40 yards of rushing on 12 attempts and 89 yards of passing. Gillom's booming punts – his five kicks averaged 45 yards – also helped the Browns stop New York's dangerous return game. The Yankees had a 4.7-yard punt return average.|$|E

5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit <b>stop</b> <b>by</b> Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E
