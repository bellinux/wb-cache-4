50|$|The {{equations}} {{that govern}} nonlinear acoustics are quite complicated and unfortunately {{they do not}} have general analytical solutions. They usually require the use of a computer simulation. However, as early as 1965, Berktay performed an analysis under some simplifying assumptions that allowed the demodulated SPL to be written in terms of the amplitude modulated ultrasonic carrier wave pressure Pc and various physical parameters. Note that the demodulation process is extremely lossy, with a minimum loss in the order of 60 dB from the ultrasonic SPL to the audible wave SPL. A precompensation scheme can be based from Berktay's expression, shown in Equation 1, by taking the square root of the base band <b>signal</b> <b>envelope</b> E and then integrating twice to invert the effect of the double partial time derivative. The analogue electronic circuit equivalents of a square root function is simply an op-amp with feedback, and an equalizer is analogous to an integration function. However these topic areas lie outside the scope of this project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Information about {{a mobile}} user’s {{velocity}} {{is important for}} efficient resource management and quality of service (QoS) provisioning in next generation (NG) wireless systems. A mobile receiver’s velocity spreads the received <b>signal</b> <b>envelope</b> in the frequency domain. This spreading is directly proportional to its velocity. A novel algorithm called VEPSD (Velocity Estimation using the Power Spectral Density of the received <b>signal</b> <b>envelope)</b> is introduced in this paper that uses the amount of Doppler spread in the received <b>signal</b> <b>envelope</b> to estimate the velocity of a mobile user. The Doppler spread is estimated using {{the slope of the}} power spectral density (PSD) of the received <b>signal</b> <b>envelope.</b> The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in both Rayleigh and Rician fading environments. The sensitivity of the estimation error to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the estimation interval (effect of finite sample size), the sampling period, Rice factor (K), and the angle of arrival of the line of sight (LOS) component is analyzed and compared with the level crossing rate (LCR) and co-variance based velocity estimators. Also, it is shown that the proposed algorithm, VEPSD, can be used for velocity estimation under non-isotropic scattering and frequency selective fading and is well suited for NG wireless systems.
