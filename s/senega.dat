50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Quillaja saponaria {{can be reduced}} to powder and {{employed}} as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glucoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as quillaia saponin. It also applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in soapwort (Saponaria officinalis), in <b>senega</b> root (Polygala <b>senega)</b> and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in digitalis. The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics.|$|E
50|$|There is {{interest}} in turning the plant into a workable agricultural crop, especially in Canada. Overexploitation {{of the native}} plant is a concern, {{and there has been}} evidence of overharvest in some areas. At its peak in the year 1931, Canada exported about 781,000 pounds of dry <b>senega</b> root, which equals 2 million pounds of fresh plant. More yet was supplied to the domestic market. Today about 100,000 pounds of fresh plant are harvested annually from the wild in Canada. Herbal remedies are becoming popular again, and demand for <b>senega</b> grows an estimated 5% per year. The biggest importers of the Canadian product, as of the mid-90s, were Europe, Japan, and the United States.|$|E

40|$|Ethanolic extract of Polygala <b>senega</b> (EEPS) {{had little}} or no {{cytotoxic}} effects on normal lung cells, but caused cell death and apoptosis to lung cancer cell line A 549. In the present paper, ethanolic root extract of P. <b>senega</b> (EEPS) was nanoencapsulated (size: 147. 7 [*]nm) by deploying a biodegradable poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA). The small size of the NEEPS resulted in an enhanced cellular entry and greater bioavailability. The growth of cancer cells was inhibited better by NEEPS than EEPS. Both EEPS and NEEPS induced apoptosis of A 549 cells, which was associated with decreased expression of survivin, PCNA mRNA, and increased expression of caspase- 3, p 53 [*]mRNAs of A 549 cells. The results show that the anticancer potential of the formulation of EEPS-loaded PLGA nanoparticles was more effective than EEPS per se, probably due to more aqueous dispersion after nanoencapsulation. Therefore, nanoencapsulated ethanolic root extract of P. <b>senega</b> may serve as a potential chemopreventive agent against lung cancer...|$|E

We deployed various parameters like cell viability assay, chromatin condensation studies with Hoechst 333258 staining, and maintained suitable controls. To understand the possible signal transduction pathways, expression of various signal proteins such as Aryl Hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), cytochrome P 450 (CYP 1 A 1), Bcl- 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax and Caspase- 3 was studied. Additionally, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of AhR, p 53, PCNA and β-actin (housekeeping) genes was made. Immunohistochemical localization of PCNA proteins was also conducted in vivo. Feeding of root extract of P. <b>senega</b> to mice (at the rate of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg bw) chronically treated with the carcinogen (50 mg/kg bw dissolved in olive oil) showed positive modulation in expression of signal proteins. Upregulation of apoptotic signals such as p 53, Caspase- 3 and Bax, and downregulation of AhR, cytochrome P 450 (CYP 1 A 1), Bcl- 2 and PCNA were observed. Addition of root extract of Polygala <b>Senega</b> (at doses of 50 μg and 100 μg) into culture medium containing A 549 cells induced recovery of decreased cell viability and increased chromatin fragmentation (apoptosis).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} anticancer potentials of Polygala <b>senega</b> on {{lung cancer}} induced by benzo［a］pyrene (B［a］P) in mice. Methods: Swiss albino mice {{were divided into}} five groups with each containing six animals. Group 1 served as control, and the animals received olive oil as vehicle. Group 2 animals were treated with B［a］P (50 mg/kg body weight dissolved in olive oil) orally twice a week for four consecutive weeks. Group 3 animals were fed B［a］P as in group 2 and 48 % alcohol (since the vehicle of the remedy was alcohol). Group 4 animals were B［a］P-intoxicated mice (as in group 2) which were additionally fed ethanolic extract of Polygala <b>senega</b> (EEPS) daily for 16 weeks. EEPS treatment started after the first dose of B［a］P. Group 5 animals were treated with EEPS alone for 16 weeks to test cytotoxicity of EEPS if any. Mice were sacrificed after 16 weeks and the following parameters were assessed: the anti-oxidant activity measured by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl free radical assay, tumor incidence, lung weight and body weight, DNA damage evaluation by comet assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); toxicity biomarkers like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total thiol content were also detected. Results: Treatment with EEPS increased the final body weight and significantly decreased the lung weight in group 4 mice (P< 0. 01) compared with group 3 mice. Comet assay showed that EEPS-treated mice in group 4 presented a decrease of DNA damage significantly (P< 0. 01) in lung tissues. There was a significant increase observed {{in the level of}} p 53 in group 4 as compared with group 3 (P< 0. 01) detected by ELISA. A highly significant increase in tissue LPO with concomitant decrease in the activity of anti-oxidants was observed in group 2 and group 3 mice (P< 0. 05) compared with the control mice. These adverse changes were reversed significantly in group 4 mice (P< 0. 01).

The {{aim of this}} paper is to analyse whether rural Senegal members of a {{health insurance}} scheme are actually better-off than nonmembers. The results show that in poor environments, insurance programs can work: Members of les mutuelles de sante (mutual health organizations) have a higher probability of using hospitalization services than nonmembers and pay substantially less when they need care. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that while the schemes achieved to attract poor people, the poorest of the poor remained excluded. Ó 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article explores {{the role of}} political parties in facilitating these different and successful paths to democratic transitions. In Benin, political parties and political leaders relied on the prevailing patterns of ethno-regional cleavages to structure their strategic interactions, mobilize electoral support and organize competition in legislative and presidential elections. In Senegal, an incremental pattern of institutional reform helped the ruling party retain power while enabling fragmented oppo-sition groups to participate in competitive elections. In the long run, this helped opposition groups develop an effective electoral coalition to defeat the ruling party in presidential and legislative elections and bring about a turnover in government.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{examines}} {{social and environmental}} influences {{on the development of}} hypertension in a sample of 568 adults (290 men; 278 women) aged 20 years and older from Dakar, Senegal. We test the hypothesis that more recent immigrants to the city of Dakar will have lower blood pressure and lower rates of hypertension than those who have lived there longer. Cross-sectional sociodemographic, anthropometric and blood pressure data were collected during 2009. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 27. 1 % (95 % CI: 25. 229. 0). Hypertension rates were not significantly associated with place of birth; however, length of residence in Dakar was a significant predictor, with those living in the city for less than 10 years having reduced risks of developing hypertension (OR = 0. 25; P = 0. 003). Other important correlates of blood pressure and hypertension risk in this sample were age and body mass index. These findings suggest that length of exposure to the urban environmentand associated changes in lifestyleare linked to hypertension. Public health officials should thus pay particular attention to this phenomenon, and future anthropological research should include measures of both environmental and biological characteristics to study hypertension in <b>Senega...</b>|$|E
30|$|So far, {{only two}} gums {{available}} to Norwich dyers {{have been identified}} in newspaper advertisements: ‘gum <b>Senega</b> Arabic’ and ‘gum tragacanth’ [66]. Besides performing FTIR analysis with each of the individual sixteen extracts, we used a combination of them all to run GC–MS, which still rendered a relatively small sample, allowing us to do just one analysis, likely contaminated with glucose from samples being adhered to a paper support. Because glucose as contamination is common in historic and ancient artefacts, running a sample of a nearby area as blank is highly recommended [67, 68]. However, given our pattern book is practically undamaged, we considered taking another sample unethical and did not run this blank. Our analysis showed major peaks for glucose and galactose, and minor peaks for arabinose and rhamnose. Altogether this evidence might suggest the presence of a polysaccharide, perhaps a natural gum suggested by FTIR and mentioned in advertisements. Its presence could not be confirmed or unequivocally identified. This is ongoing research. Using a different pattern book, held in Special Collections at the Winterthur Museum, we have collected glazed samples, from which water- and carbon tetrachloride- soluble components will be analysed for a larger study on the subject (unpublished results).|$|E

We develop estimation strategies based on the full information maximum likelihood and the two-step method. We derive a wide and rich collection of treatment effects ranging from exclusive to relative effects including sequential and substitution effects. The {{results show that the}} combination of deworming and school meals programs is more beneficial to pupils' achievements than taking programs separately. The sequence of implementation does matter. The two programs are complementary in increasing scores and promotion rates. However, they are substitutes in reducing dropouts. The cost-effectiveness analysis shows the deworming program is by far cheaper than the meals intervention. Implementing meals program before deworming is more cost-effective than the reverse. Lastly, unlike the deworming, meals program and the package (deworming and meals) have a welfare-enhancing effect on households.

40|$|Abstract: Asthenopia (eyestrain) {{is defined}} as {{reversible}} fatigue of the eyes due to overuse of the visual system (Tiwari et al., 2011). This {{may be caused by}} an imbalance between visual capacity to fixate on a task and prolonged near work. Computer use is a common cause of asthenopia, with approximately 64 - 90 % of people using computers suffering from ocular discomfort. The symptoms of asthenopia include tired, burning, itching eyes; lacrimation; photophobia; blurred and double vision; as well as occasional headaches (Blehm et al., 2005). Dryness of the eyes is also commonly associated with computer-induced asthenopia, and further aggravates asthenopic symptoms. Asthenopia has an impact on work productivity as well as quality of life (Djalilian, 2016, Portello et al., 2012, Rosenfield, 2011). Conventional treatment for asthenopia includes the use of lubricating eye drops and occupational glasses (Gaby, 2008) and in addition forced blinking and punctal occlusion for dry eyes (Rosenfield, 2011). There are many homoeopathic remedies indicated for the treatment of asthenopia. The homoeopathic complex assessed in this study is a readily available eye drop solution that is indicated for the relief of computer-induced asthenopia. The complex contains the following remedies: Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrium muriaticum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 X and <b>Senega</b> officinalis 6 X.

40|$|Abstract: Visual {{display units}} (VDU’s) such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, computers, game {{consoles}} and televisions {{have become an}} essential part of our modern life both in school and at work places (Izquierdo & Townsend, 2008). Up to 90 % of computer users may experience visual symptoms {{at one time or another}} with the use of VDU’s (Barthakur, 2013). Asthenopia (eyestrain) is typically associated with near-work and symptoms include dry eyes, eye fatigue and difficulty focusing. The major cause of computer-induced asthenopia is fatigue of the ciliary and extra-ocular muscles due to prolonged accommodation and vergence required by near-vision work (Tiwari et al., 2011). The severity of the symptoms is proportional to the time spent using a VDU device and symptoms are substantially reduced after discontinuing usage; even so, the symptoms can affect work productivity and quality of life (Barthakur, 2013). Conventional treatment for asthenopia includes correction of refractive errors, use of occupational glasses, eye drops and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014); ergonomic measures can also be helpful (Barthakur, 2013). Homoeopathy is a holistic treatment modality based on the “Law of Similars” (Dekkers, 2009). Homoeopathic remedies enhance the body’s own curative abilities, enabling the body to heal itself (Ahmad, 2005). Homoeopathic remedies may provide a safe complementary treatment option for asthenopia.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} like Senegal {{are faced with}} high illiteracy rates. In its efforts to improve literacy, the Senegalese government has developed nationwide adult literacy programs, and has adopted a strategy commonly known as 'faire-faire"", based on a partnership between the State and civil society. This study explores two adult literacy programs from the experiences {{of participants in the}} villages of Ngohe and Ndoulo, located in the region of Diourbel, Senegal. The purpose of the study is to examine the outcomes of those programs and their impact on the lives of the participants, through interviews with the different actors involved in the implementation of the literacy programs (education officials, literacy operators, facilitators and participants), review of documents and observation. I have adopted the theoretical perspective known as critical theory and defined by Fay (1987) as concerned with empowering human beings to transcend the constraints placed on them by race, class, and gender. The findings of the study reveal that ""faire-faire"" has helped to boost literacy rates and has improved literacy education in Senegal. The participants' lives have considerably improved {{as a result of their}} enrollment in the literacy classes. They have developed income-generating activities, increased their knowledge on health and hygiene, participated in village meetings, and acquired problem-solving skills. However, despite these positive aspects, one needs to acknowledge that ""faire-faire"" presents some deficiencies: the choice of the operators did not always follow the recommendations in the procedures manuals, the facilitators received little or no training, and supervision of the literacy classes was not appropriately done. In light of these findings, it is important that the State allocate more funds to the literacy sub-sector and be more rigorous in the implementation of the literacy programs, for instance when it comes to the selection of the operators in order to improve literacy education in <b>Senega...</b>|$|E

This SHL displays synoptic and intra-seasonal pulsations of its intensity on time scales under 60 days. In this study, we analyse the regional-scale pattern of low troposphere dynamics and convective activity associated with weak and strong phases of the SHL during the summer, using 18 years (1984 - 2001) of concomitant European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts re-analysis data and satellite observations of brightness temperature provided by the European Union-funded Cloud Archive User Service. Strong SHL phases, defined by an increase of low-level atmospheric thickness, are accompanied by (1) a positive anomaly of temperature in the low layers, (2) a strengthening of the monsoon flow, (3) both a negative anomaly of the divergence flux and an enhancement of the moisture advection over the central Sahel, (4) an intensification of the African easterly jet and (5) enhanced upward vertical motions located south of the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD). These conditions appear to be favourable for the occurrence of convection over the central Sahel. The strongest, most widespread convective activity over the central and eastern Sahel occurs on the day when the SHL intensity is the strongest. In contrast, a significant decrease of the convective activity was detected over Senegal and to the West of the Jos Plateau. Opposite patterns are found during weak SHL phases, with a negative anomaly of convection over the central and eastern Sahel connected with anomalous subsidence south of the ITD and a negative moisture advection anomaly.

Twenty out of 49 applicants with training in library or information' science were selected on the basis of their own proposals for a course project. Participants were from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'lvoire, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo. The course was modular in form. Participants were able to improve their knowledge of library techniques (including indexing, setting up and managing databases and electronic data transfer), adult education methods and design, organization and management of training. The teaching methods used included seminars, individual or group work, case studies and computer tutorials. At each stage of the course participants were expected to reflect on what they had learnt and to modify their personal project. They were faced with a real life situation during the computer tutorials. These received the highest praise during the final evaluation of the course. The full benefit of these courses will be seen when the participants and their employers organize local training courses during 1996. The courses and the assistance given to other libraries will act as a trial for the training given in Dakar.

40|$|Within any rural region, {{the daily}} demand for food changes very little during any given year, {{but the food}} supply is {{seasonal}} and is very uneven on a month-to-month basis. Among other solutions, such as local food imports, storage is an important means of trying to match the uneven supply of food to demand. In areas where transport is poorly developed, storage is even more important. The two strategies usually selected for coping with present and future demands of food are increasing food supplies by increasing production through allocation of more resources to agriculture, and reducing future demand by slowing population growth. A third, and complementary strategy, is that of reducing and preventing post-production food losses by improving the efficiency of storage. Reducing food losses means that less of the rural families' disposable income need be spent on food imports. Grain storage losses in Zimbabwe is a survey of traditional farmers' grain storage in that country. It looks at methods of measuring damage during storage as well as measuring its reduction by improving storage facilities which nevertheless remain {{as close as possible}} to the traditional granary model. Results showed that farmers store maize for shorter periods because of high losses experienced as the storage period increases. The level of losses was also related to the type of grain being stored. Traditional maize varieties are more resistant to pest attack than hybrids and traditional storage structures were designed for traditional varieties. There is no point in encouraging farmers to grow improved, hybrid varieties in order to increase yields, if the extra yield is rapidly lost in storage. The book ends with a number of recommendations, details of an improved traditional granary, and appendices which set out percentage damage against time after a variety of treatments.

40|$|Background: In Senegal, {{unintended}} pregnancy {{has become}} a growing concern in public health circles. It has often been described through the press as a sensational subject with emphasis on the multiple infanticide cases as a main consequence, especially among young unmarried girls. Less scientific evidence is known on this topic, as fertility issues are rarely discussed within couples. In a context where urbanization is strong, economic insecurity is persistent and the population is globalizing, {{it is important to}} assess the magnitude of unintended pregnancy among urban women and to identify its main determinants. Methods: Data were collected in 2011 from a representative sample of 9614 women aged 15 – 49 years in six urban sites in Senegal. For this analysis, we include 5769 women who have ever been pregnant or were pregnant {{at the time of the}} survey. These women were asked if their last pregnancy in the last two years was ‘wanted ’then’, ‘wanted later’ or ‘not wanted’. Pregnancy was considered as unintended if the woman responded ‘wanted later’ or ‘not wanted’. Descriptive analyses were performed to measure the magnitude of unintended pregnancies, while multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the occurrence of unintended pregnancy. The analyses were performed using Stata version 12. All results were weighted. Results: The results show that 14. 3 % of ever pregnant women reported having a recent unintended pregnancy. The study demonstrates important distinctions between women whose last pregnancy was intended and those whose last pregnancy was unintended. Indeed, this last group is more likely to be poor, from a young age (< 25 years) and multiparous. In addition, it appears that low participation of married women in decision-making within the couple (management of financial resources) and the lack of discussion on family planning issues are associated with greater experience of unintended pregnancy. Conclusion: This study suggests a need to implement more targeted programs that guarantee access to family planning for all women in need. In urban areas that are characterized by economic insecurity, as in Senegal, it is important to consider strategies for promoting communication within couples on fertility issues.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Seeds of A. senegal (L.) Wild {{from four}} populations across a {{rainfall}} gradient in western Sudan were grown in two sites. One site {{is on an}} upper dune crest - (sandy soil) and the other site is on the lower slope of the same dune - (sandy loam soil). Soils significantly influenced all growth parameters except foliar N concentration. Seedlings of all populations survived and grew better on the upper dune crest (sandy soil). Populations differed only in foliar N. concentration. Although the number of first order branches did not differ among populations, there were large differences among individual seedlings {{in two of the}} populations. In a second study four populations of A. senegal from western Sudan were cross inoculated with soil from the same populations. Population x soil inoculum interaction was significant for all measured growth parameters. Specific nitrogenase activity, averaging 22. 2 uml/g fw/h, did not differ significantly between populations, soil inoculum Sources, or with interaction between the two. The greatest specificity between populations and source of inoculum was shown by shoot and nodule weights in populations from the extremes of the rainfall gradient. Seedlings from all populations exhibited a relatively high relationship between home soil and root length. In a third ezperjement, two Acacia <b>senega</b> 1 seed lots, one collected near Elobjed, a relatively low rainfall zone, and the other near Rae, a high rainfall zone (both In western Sudan), were inoculated with each of the following Rhjzobjum strains: strain AR 14, isolated from A. radiana, strain AN 12, isolated from A. nilotica adjestrjnqs, strain P 3 12, isolated from Prosopis juliflora, strain TAL 1595 isolated from A. pennetu 1 a, and strain ASK isolated from A. Senegal. Popu 1 ation x rhizobium strain interaction was significant for shoot height. from the high rainfall zone was Height of Kas seedlings more sensitive to strain treatment than that of Elobied seedlings from the low rainfall zone, Strain main effect was highly significant for Shoot Weight. Seedlings inoculated with ASK strain, isolated from A. Senegal, had a greater weight, especially in comparison to PJ 12 strains, which were isolated from prosopis juliflora. Seedlings inoculated with the ASK strain nodulated earlier than seedlings inoculated with other strains...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Abstract: Asthenopia (eyestrain) {{is defined}} as {{reversible}} fatigue of the eyes due to overuse of the visual system (Tiwari et al., 2011). This {{may be caused by}} an imbalance between visual capacity to fixate on a task and prolonged near work. Computer use is a common cause of asthenopia, with approximately 64 - 90 % of people using computers suffering from ocular discomfort. The symptoms of asthenopia include tired, burning, itching eyes; lacrimation; photophobia; blurred and double vision; as well as occasional headaches (Blehm et al., 2005). Dryness of the eyes is also commonly associated with computer-induced asthenopia, and further aggravates asthenopic symptoms. Asthenopia has an impact on work productivity as well as quality of life (Djalilian, 2016, Portello et al., 2012, Rosenfield, 2011). Conventional treatment for asthenopia includes the use of lubricating eye drops and occupational glasses (Gaby, 2008) and in addition forced blinking and punctal occlusion for dry eyes (Rosenfield, 2011). There are many homoeopathic remedies indicated for the treatment of asthenopia. The homoeopathic complex assessed in this study is a readily available eye drop solution that is indicated for the relief of computer-induced asthenopia. The complex contains the following remedies: Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrium muriaticum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 X and <b>Senega</b> officinalis 6 X. To date, no research could be found on the effect of the complex on dry eyes associated with computer-induced asthenopia. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of a homoeopathic complex eye drop solution on dry eyes associated with computer-induced asthenopia, by means of a Visual Analogue Scale and assessing Tear Break-Up Time. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, one day study conducted at the University of Johannesburg (UJ). This was a combined study and the sample was shared with another researcher who assessed the effect of the complex on the symptoms of computer-induced asthenopia. Thirty -seven participants, aged 18 - 35 years, both male and female, were recruited by means of purposive sampling. Advertisements were placed at the UJ Doornfontein campus with permission obtained. Potential participants attended an initial consultation at the UJ Optometry Clinic; they were requested to read and sign the Participant Information and Consent Form, complete the Participant Selection Questionnaire and were tested for refractive errors. Patients who measured high errors were excluded from the study and referred for further assessment. Participants then played a [...] ...|$|E
