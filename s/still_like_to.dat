Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen proposed a three-day cooling period in which clients would be informed three days before actually procuring the mushrooms and if they would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go through with it they could pick up their spores from the smart shop.|$|E

NRK also directly invited composers to submit songs for the contest, {{as they did in}} 2007. All entries had to be received by NRK by 1 September. Composers of all nationalities were again welcome in the competition, despite the controversy that has arisen in recent years over the number of songs written by Swedish composers that {{can be found in the}} competition. However NRK said that they support songs composed by Norwegians, but that they would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> open the contest to foreign composers, hence all entries were under consideration.|$|E
500|$|Iyall {{released}} a solo album entitled Strange Language with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986. Afterward she pursued {{a career as}} an art teacher. The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993. In 2004, Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1's Bands Reunited. Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage {{over the years and}} was unable to perform, although he did meet up with the band again and observed the reunion performance in an adjacent room. Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events. [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> sing and I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> perform," [...] she said. In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water. She began collaborating with Peter Dunne, who was known as Peter [...] when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for Crawdaddy! founder Paul Williams in June 2009, and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September. They {{released a}}n album entitled Stay Strong in 2010.|$|E

In April 2012, the parish council renamed itself as a Town Council.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Davis {{became the}} first woman to receive the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. The {{televised}} event included comments from several of Davis' colleagues, including William Wyler, who joked that given the chance, Davis would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> refilm a scene from The Letter to which Davis nodded. Jane Fonda, Henry Fonda, Natalie Wood, and Olivia de Havilland were among the performers who paid tribute, with de Havilland commenting that Davis [...] "got the roles I always wanted".|$|E
2500|$|A reboot of the {{original}} series had been announced since late 2009, when screenwriter Josh Friedman was hired to write a pilot script. Friedman's script was ultimately rejected, and ABC hired Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to pen a new version. In an interview, Alfred Gough expressed his desire to avoid doing anything [...] "campy or retro." [...] He later stated, [...] "The characters are real and emotionally grounded, but they <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have fun, wear great clothes, solve crime, and kick some serious ass...we hope to surprise people and bring {{a whole new generation}} to Charlie's Angels." ...|$|E

5000|$|Takeasaurus (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - A {{adolescent}} watermelon-like dinosaur {{who lives}} with his mommy under the lake outside of the house. His real name is Blaine, but calls himself [...] "Takeasaurus" [...] because he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> take things that aren't his. He stopped taking things after it upset his mommy, but <b>still</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> call himself Takeasaurus. He has a slightly bad reputation with the veggies, but is generally accepted among the townsfolk.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2013 Salmon {{recalled}} [...] "a {{whole lot}} of what I do is tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. This is great, but I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 December 2011, The Jerusalem Post {{reported}} that a performance analysis it had obtained shows that Iron Dome was successful in downing rockets from Gaza 75% of the times it fired. It said two interceptors are usually fired at each rocket. In April 2011, for example, the system succeeded in intercepting eight of 10rockets. Following the October violence, the IDF conducted an inquiry into the Iron Dome's performance and discovered that a radar failure caused some of the interceptors to miss their targets, a problem since corrected. An officer told the Post that [...] "seventy-five percent is impressive, but we would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see it perform better." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E

"The old boy <b>still</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> {{play the}} mouth-organ--nothing like these old codgers for {{thinking}} they're still kids," [...] Mr. Hartwig puffed at dinner, then banged {{his fist and}} laughed rollingly. He seemed surprised when Father merely flushed and tightened his tie. For all his gross body, Mr. Hartwig was sensitive--so sensitive that he was hurt when people didn't see the humor of his little sallies.|$|R

Lynn and her husband of eight years, Peter, put his longevity down to wholesome food, plenty of love and regular checkups at the vet. Lynn often had {{to sleep in the}} spare room in their house, as Otto preferred to be tucked up in bed with her husband at night.|$|R
5000|$|Louis Pattison of NME {{called the}} song [...] "a magic carpet ride of bucking riffery and {{thrashing}} bead-shakers" [...] {{and stated that}} it [...] "ranks with Pearl Jam's best." [...] Brett Hickman of Stylus said, [...] "What Riot Act also makes known is that the band <b>still</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> crank it. This is especially clear on [...] "Save You". The guitars screech and churn, while Cameron hammers home a crackling beat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic {{newspapers}} all published very hostile {{reviews of}} The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen [...] for its anti-Semitism. Protestant völkisch newspapers [...] gave The Foundations very good reviews while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's {{call for a}} racialized Christianity. One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude {{that it was no}} surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament. One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer-Cohn wrote that The Foundations was [...] "bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning." [...] German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsburge jüdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen [...] had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence. The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, {{and one of the reasons}} for that belief was: [...] "Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?". Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of [...] "the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred".|$|E

JA WOHL--the Hof authorities had no doubt heard of his visit and had intimated to the hotel proprietor {{that he might have}} permission to visit the model farm and dairy. As the American still looked indifferent the porter pointed out with some importance that it was a Ducal courtesy not to be lightly treated; that few, indeed, of the burghers themselves had ever been admitted to this eccentric whim of the late Grand Duchess. He would, of course, be silent about it; the Court would not like it known that they had made an exception to their rules in favor of a foreigner; he would enter quickly and boldly alone. There would be a housekeeper or a dairymaid to show him over the place.|$|E
60|$|Has not {{everybody}} {{who has lived}} abroad met Captain Raff? His name is proclaimed, every now and then, by Mr. Sheriff's Officer Hemp; and about Boulogne, and Paris, and Brussels, {{there are so many}} of his sort that I will lay a wager that I shall be accused of gross personality for showing him up.

60|$|As for {{the young}} English gentleman passionately attached, he followed, it is understood; faithful, {{constant}} as shadow to the sun, always a stage behind; arrived in Berlin two hours after his Barberina, still passionately attached; and now, as the rumor goes, was threatening even to marry her, and so save the matter. Supremely indifferent to my readers and me. But here now is the circumstance that makes it mentionable. The young English is properly a young Scotch gentleman; James Mackenzie the name of him,--a grandson of the celebrated Advocate, Sir George Mackenzie; and younger Brother of a personage who, as Earl of Bute, became extremely conspicuous in this Kingdom in after years. That makes it mentionable,--if only {{in the shape of}} MYTH. For Friedrich, according to rumor, being <b>still</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> lose his Dancer in that manner, warned the young gentleman's friends; and had him peremptorily summoned home, and the light fantastic toe left free in that respect. Which procedure the indignant young gentleman (thinks my Author) never forgave; continuing a hater of Friedrich all his days; and instilling the same sentiment into the Earl of Bute at a period which was very critical, as we shall see. This is my Author's, the often fallacious though not mendacious Dr. Zimmermann's, rather deliberate account; a man not given to mendacity, though filled with much vague wind, which renders him fallacious in historical points.|$|E
