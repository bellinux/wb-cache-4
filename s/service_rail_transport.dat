Combined with the use of small autonomous transport units, this helps to meet changed market requirements for freight transport. Initial simulation results of an agent based system prototype prove feasibility of the concept and give qualitative results indicating the effects of individual strategies of distinct actors on quality of service and overall system per-formance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. At {{the present}} stage of {{development}} of Ukraine’s economy, passenger traffic service quality management of railway enterprises {{became one of the}} main tasks to ensure their efficient operation. In terms of railway re-forms and increased competition in the transport market, the discrepancies between the technological level of traffic and the growing needs of society and the quality standards of transport services, the priority is the establishment of quality management system for passenger traffic <b>services</b> in <b>rail</b> <b>transport.</b> This question should be considered in the paper. Methodology. To achieve this goal and ensure a high quality level of passenger traffic <b>services</b> in <b>rail</b> trans-port, which involves a combination of approaches to the position of consumers (determination of their satisfaction) and railway enterprises (measurement of results and formation processes of service quality), the paper proposed a passenger traffic service quality management system. The proposed methodical approach to formation of the passenger traffic service quality management system in <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> implements a principally new scheme of interaction of elements during provision of services, where the inter-related resources (human, material, financial, information), means, instruments and processes result in creation of quality transport service. Findings. The efficiency of the passenger traffic service quality management system allows detecting the dynamic of improvement of the services provided by the railway enterprises and building the system which is self-learning on the principles of continuous improvement. The paper grounded new principles of the passenger traffic quality management, which were formed on the basis of general management principles, quality management principles and railway transport management principles. Originality. The work presents the developed passenger traffic service quality management system targeted to meet the expectations of passengers from transport process while taking into account the economic interests of railway enterprises. The basis of this system is conceptual principles, namely, goal, objectives, subject, object, principles, functions and practical recommendations, which generally determine the relationship of the basic elements of the passenger traffic service quality management in <b>rail</b> <b>transport.</b> Practical value. The practical value of the obtained by the author results is that their implementation will enable railway enterprises to forecast the improvement of service quality level, taking into account their specific features and create solutions for control and regulation of processes and passenger traffic service quality effects. The theoretical and methodological provisions may be used in the formation, operation and improvement of the quality management system for passenger traffic <b>services</b> in <b>rail</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R

The forecasted changes, in terms of projected cargo types in <b>rail</b> freight <b>transport,</b> total freight transport demand and the corresponding development of service, will influence customer service expectations. They will also directly impact on the flexibility and ability of rail operations and their integration with other transport modes (e.g. pick-up service at origins and delivery service at destinations) to meet customer demands and expectations. The flexible ability to offer such door-to-door, as well as terminal-to-terminal, <b>services</b> will influence <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> in general, and rail infrastructure in particular, at a national and a European level. It is important that the rail industry and governments maintain a policy of development and investment, if the EU Transport White Paper targets are to be achieved.|$|R

The government has recently introduced several reforms to strengthen the competition policy framework. Nevertheless, to reap the full benefits of competitive markets, past reforms should be complemented {{with a number of}} further measures. The powers of the Competition Authority can still be enhanced. Its effective degree of independence, substantially improved in the recent reform, and its accountability should be monitored in order to assess whether further measures in this direction are needed. In the retail sector competition-restricting regulations still protect existing companies against new entry and inhibit the diffusion of new business models and technologies. The reform efforts in the network sectors remain patchy. In the energy and telecommunication sectors the main issues are the dominant positions of the incumbents and the failure of network sector regulators to introduce a level playing field in order to allow new entry and expansion of competitors. In other sectors, such as postal <b>services</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> major steps towards liberalisation are still to come. Overall, sectoral regulators will need mor...|$|R
