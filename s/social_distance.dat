This paper formulates a differential-game to identify how individuals would best use <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> and related self-protective behaviors during an epidemic. The epidemic is described by a simple, well-mixed ordinary differential equation model.

Numerical methods are used to calculate the total costs of an epidemic under equilibrium behaviors as a function of the time to mass vaccination, following epidemic identification.

40|$|Epidemics of {{respiratory}} infectious disease remain {{one of the}} most serious health risks facing the population. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e. g. hand-washing or wearing face masks) can have a significant impact on the course of an infectious disease epidemic. The current study investigated whether protection motivation theory (PMT) is a useful framework for understanding <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour (i. e. the tendency to reduce social contacts) in response to a simulated infectious disease epidemic. There were 230 participants (109 males, 121 females, mean age 32. 4 years) from the general population who completed self-report measures assessing the components of PMT. In addition, participants completed a computer game which simulated an infectious disease epidemic in order to provide a measure of <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour. The regression analyses revealed that none of the PMT variables were significant predictors of <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour during the simulation task. However, fear (β=. 218,p<. 001), response efficacy (β=. 175,p<. 01) and self-efficacy (β=. 251,p<. 001) were all significant predictors of intention to engage in <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables (and demographic factors) explain 21. 2 % of the variance in intention. The findings demonstrated that PMT was a useful framework for understanding intention to engage in <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour, but not actual behaviour during the simulated epidemic. These findings may reflect an intention-behaviour gap in relation to <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> behaviour...|$|R

The same survey has shown that, in fact, that Ukrainian people are slightly more comfortable accepting Russians into their families than they are accepting Ukrainians living abroad. Such social attitude correlates with the political one as the surveys taken yearly between 1997 and 2005 consistently indicated that the attitude {{to the idea of}} Ukraine joining the union of Russia and Belarus is more positive (slightly over 50%) than negative (slightly under 30%).|$|E

40|$|During {{outbreaks}} {{of infectious diseases}} with high morbidity and mortality, individuals closely follow media reports of the outbreak. Many will attempt to minimize contacts with other individuals {{in order to protect}} themselves from infection and possibly death. This process is called <b>social</b> <b>distancing.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>distancing</b> strategies include restricting socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. We use modeling to show that for short-term outbreaks, <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> can have a large influence on reducing outbreak morbidity and mortality. In particular, public health agencies working together with the media can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak by providing timely accounts of new infections and deaths. Our models show that the most effective strategy to reduce infections is to provide this information as early as possible, though providing it well into the course of the outbreak can still have a significant effect. However, our models for long-term outbreaks indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all. We examine three types of media influence and we illustrate the media influence with a simulated outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. <b>Social</b> <b>distancing</b> can never be complete; however, for a spectrum of outbreaks, we show that leaving isolation (stopping applying <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> measures) for up to 4 hours each day has modest effect on the overall morbidity and mortality...|$|R

25|$|Level I is {{typically}} used by non-age-mates and non-intimates and is unmarked {{in terms of}} prefixation or suffixation of the listener and verbs. Level II is marked by the prefix on- on the verb and is used between intimates. Some Nahuatl speakers have been observed to alternate between Level I and Level II for one listener. The use of both levels is believed to show some respect or to not subordinate the listener. Level III is marked by the prefix on-, the reflexive prefix mo-, and an appropriate transitivizing suffix based on the verb stem. Verbs in Level III may additionally be marked with the reverential suffix –tzinōa. Finally, Level IV {{is typically}} used between people who share a ritual kinship relationship (e.g. parent with godparent, godparent with godparent of the same child).

40|$|Background: Studies of <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> during {{epidemics}} {{have found}} that the strength of the response can have a decisive impact on the outcome. In previous work we developed a model of <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> driven by individuals' risk attitude, a parameter which determines the extent to which social contacts are reduced in response to a given infection level.

There is little data available about this as opportunistic data collection during epidemics is difficult. Our study uses a simulated epidemic in a computer game setting to measure the <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> response. Methods: Two hundred thirty participants played a computer game simulating an epidemic on a spatial network. The player controls one individual in a population of 2500 (with others controlled by computer) and decides how many others to contact each day. To mimic real-world trade-offs, the player is motivated to make contact by being rewarded with points, while simultaneously being deterred by the threat of infection. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding psychological measures of health protection motivation. Finally, simulations were used to compare the experimentally-observed response to epidemics with no response. Results: Participants reduced contacts in response to infection {{in a manner consistent with}} our model of <b>social</b> <b>distancing.</b> The experimentally observed response was too weak to halt epidemics quickly, resulting in a somewhat reduced attack rate and a substantially reduced peak attack rate, but longer duration and fewer social contacts, compared to no response. Little correlation was observed between participants' risk attitudes and the psychological measures. Conclusions: Our cognitive model of <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> matches responses to a simulated epidemic. If these responses indicate real world behaviour, spontaneous <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> can be expected to reduce peak attack rates. However, additional measures are needed if it is important to stop an epidemic quickly...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{influenza}} transmission {{have focused on}} the ability of vaccination, antiviral therapy, and <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> strategies to mitigate epidemics. Influenza transmission, however, may also be interrupted by hygiene interventions such as frequent hand washing and wearing masks or respirators. We apply a model {{of influenza}} disease transmission that incorporates hygiene and <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> interventions. The model describes population mixing as a Poisson process, and the probability of infection upon contact between an infectious and susceptible person is parameterized by p. While <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> interventions modify contact rates in the population, hygiene interventions modify p. Public health decision making involves tradeoffs, and we introduce an objective function that considers the direct costs of interventions and new infections to determine the optimum intervention type (<b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> versus hygiene intervention) and population compliance for epidemic mitigation. Significant simplifications have been made in these models. However, we demonstrate that the method is feasible, provides plausible results, and is sensitive to the selection of model parameters. Specifically, we show that the optimum combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends upon the probability of infection, intervention compliance, and duration of infectiousness. Means by which realism can be increased in the method are discussed. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis...|$|R

Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U. S. public health workers.
