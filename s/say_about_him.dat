25|$|Throughout Yes Minister, {{there are}} many {{occasions}} when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually concerned with what the newspapers of the day will have to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election - his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted.|$|E
500|$|Former Tottenham manager David Pleat {{described}} Kane as an [...] "old-fashioned traditional centre-forward". Clive Allen, {{who coached}} him at Tottenham, stated that [...] "one thing I'd <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> which unfortunately you don't {{say about a}} lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game. He loves football, he loves playing, he loves scoring goals". His former Tottenham under-21 coach Les Ferdinand likened Kane's movement to their former forward Teddy Sheringham, and the power and accuracy of his shots to Alan Shearer.|$|E

After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of a nice man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E

500|$|Walker, in his 1969 biography, {{tried to}} make an {{accurate}} assessment of Brassey using Helps and other sources. [...] He {{found it difficult to}} discover anyone who had a bad word to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> either during his life or since. Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees; Cooke states that his [...] "standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme". There can be no doubt about some of his qualities. [...] He was exceptionally hardworking, and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic. [...] He was a good judge of men, which enabled him to select the best people to be his agents. He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies, supporting them financially at their times of need. He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. [...] He paid his men fairly and generously.|$|E
2500|$|Jazz critic Scott Yanow regards Marsalis as talented but {{has criticized}} his [...] "selective {{knowledge}} of jazz history" [...] and {{has said that}} he feels the fact that Marsalis considers [...] "post-1965 avant-garde playing to be outside of jazz and 1970s fusion to be barren" [...] to be the unfortunate result of the [...] "somewhat eccentric beliefs of Stanley Crouch". Bassist Stanley Clarke said [...] "All the guys that are criticizing—like Wynton Marsalis and those guys—I would hate to be around to hear those guys playing on top of a groove!" [...] But Clarke also said, [...] "These things I've said about Wynton are my criticism of him, but the positive things I have to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> outweigh the negative. He has brought respectability back to jazz." ...|$|E
2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look at it that way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

50|$|The Gospel of John {{refers to}} Golgotha {{as being very}} near the city, so near that all who passed by could read the inscription.
