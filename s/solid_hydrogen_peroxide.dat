40|$|A novel quantum-chemical {{approach}} to the properties of molecular crystals has recently been developed. This Hartree-Fock-based self-consistent-crystal-field method is outlined and applied to the intramolecular torsion angle in <b>solid</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> the cold-phase structure of solid dinitrogen and the hot-phase structure of solid acetylene. The potential-energy surfaces are calculated with the assumption of perfectly ordered crystals and coherent molecular potential-energy surfaces are produced. Agreement with experiment is obtained for hydrogen peroxide. It is suggested that discrepancies between calculated and observed structures of N 2 (s) and C 2 H 2 (s) result from static and dynamic disorder, respectively. This interpretation {{is consistent with the}} experimentally observed intramolecular-bond shortenings in these two solids. Lattice energies in good agreement with experiment are obtained in all three cases...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method of growing pure <b>solid</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> in an ultra high vacuum {{environment}} {{and apply it}} to determine thermal stability of the dihydrate compound that forms when water and hydrogen peroxide are mixed at low temperatures. Using infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, we quantified the isothermal decomposition of the metastable dihydrate at 151. 6 K. This decomposition occurs by fractional distillation through the preferential sublimation of water, which leads to the formation of pure hydrogen peroxide. The results imply that in an astronomical environment where condensed mixtures of H 2 O 2 and H 2 O are shielded from radiolytic decomposition and warmed to temperatures where sublimation is significant, highly concentrated or even pure hydrogen peroxide may form...|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic solid {{propulsion}} {{is a novel}} type {{of chemical}} rocket propulsion, {{which is based on}} the idea thai any chemical rocket propellent combination can be used in solid rocket propellant motors, if the definition of solids is not restricted to "solid and stable at ambient temperature". The CSP concept includes all suitable high energy propeilant combinations or additives and stands for sub-cooled, "green" high energy solid propulsion. CSP combines the simplicity of solids with high performance of liquid propulsion. During previous activities it was shown that green propellant combinations using hydrogen peroxide or oxygen along with hydrocarbon polymers are the best choice for entering CSP technology development. The paper describes the status of CSP development as part of a contract with the European Space Agency for larger scale CSP feasibility demonstration within the frame of ESA's Technology Research Program. For this purpose, a dedicated CSP test motor (AI-X 1), c apable of holding 1 kg of propellants based on <b>solid</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and polyethylene, was designed and manufactured at AI: Aerospace Institute (AI) in Berlin.

30|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Fenton‚Äôs oxidation. It was observed that increase in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentration increased pollutant degradation. This trend is observed till <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> reaches a critical concentration; any further increase in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentration decreases the degradation. This may be because the production of hydroxyl radicals increases with the increase in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentration, and hence, there is an increase in the removal efficiency (Yilmaz et al. 2010). However, a further increase in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> concentration results in scavenging of the OH ion by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and the incremental generation of OOH radical which also consumes OH radical; hence, the removal efficiency decreases (Walling and Kato 1971; Kang et al. 2002; Sun et al. 2007).|$|R
30|$|It is seen {{also that}} {{concentration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{is an important}} factor that influences degradation efficiency.

In addition, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> such as molecular oxygen, can attract photocatalytic conduction band electrons and thereby produce hydroxyl radicals [29, 30].|$|R
