5|$|All {{of these}} {{temperatures}} {{could be reached}} with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , {{it is important that}} <b>smelting</b> take place in a low-oxygen environment. <b>Smelting,</b> using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel. The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E

5|$|Copper <b>smelting</b> was {{independently}} {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper <b>smelting.</b> Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper <b>smelting</b> led {{to the discovery of}} iron <b>smelting.</b> Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

50|$|While <b>Smelt</b> {{eggs are}} preyed upon by adult Bullies in {{lacustrine}} areas, {{there are no}} recorded predators of <b>Smelt.</b> larvae. Adult lacustrine <b>Smelt</b> are the primary prey species for North Island trout, while juvenile migrating <b>Smelt</b> {{are more likely to}} be caught by ‘whitebaiters’ as they move upstream alongside galaxiids. As well as trout, <b>Smelt</b> are also preyed upon by many species of birds. Black and Red Billed Gulls feed mainly on juvenile <b>Smelt</b> while Adults are preyed upon by Pied Shags and Little Black Shags. Schools of shags ‘drive’ the <b>Smelt</b> by swimming and diving in formation to feed on them. Shags are considered to be the primary bird predator of adult <b>Smelt.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{is a type}} of {{metallurgical}} furnace used for <b>smelting</b> to produce industrial metals and its alloys, generally iron, but also others such as lead or copper.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper <b>smelting,</b> but modern lead <b>smelting</b> blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{trends in}} abundance and distribution for osmerid species {{collected in the}} San Francisco Estuary. For each species, abundance and distribution information is discussed {{in the context of}} life history. Analyses of larval abundance and distribution are presented for species with identifiable larvae collected in sufficient numbers. Six species of Osmeridae, or true <b>smelts,</b> were collected from the San Francisco Estuary between 1980 and 1995 (Table 1) : longfin <b>smelt,</b> Spirinchus thaleichthys; night <b>smelt,</b> S. starksi; delta <b>smelt,</b> Hypomesus transpacificus; wakasagi, H. nipponensis; surf <b>smelt,</b> H. pretiosus; and whitebait <b>smelt,</b> Allosmerus elongatus (Robins and others 1991, Stanley and others 1995). Night <b>smelt,</b> surf <b>smelt,</b> and whitebait <b>smelt</b> are marine species. The longfin <b>smelt</b> and delta <b>smelt</b> are euryhaline species, spending the early portions of their lives in freshwater and entering brackish water as late stage larvae or juveniles. Some longfin <b>smelt</b> migrate to marine waters during the middle of their lives. The wakasagi is the only non-native osmerid and has 2 life-history types in its native Japan, a completely freshwater type and an anadromous type (Hamada 1961, as cited in McAllister 1963). Wakasagi eggs from a reservoir in lapan were originally introduced into 6 California freshwater impoundments in 1959 (Wales 1962). It has since been introduced or spread to other waters, including the delta (Aasen and others 1998). Only 2 wakasagi have been captured, both b...|$|R

5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for <b>smelting</b> iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals <b>smelting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the <b>smelting</b> of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} the migration timing of fry-stocked <b>smelts</b> of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, relative to environmental and physiological factors, by using net weirs and counting fences in three tributaries of the West River, Vermont. <b>Smelt</b> migration began in late April and early May when water temperature was 5 degrees C, peak movements occurred in early and mid-May at temperatures exceeding 8 degrees C, and migration was complete by early June. Within this seasonal window, {{significant differences in}} migration timing and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity occurred among tributaries. In both years of the study, <b>smelts</b> tended to migrate earlier and exhibit greater gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the warmest tributary than in the coolest tributary. <b>Smelt</b> migration timing differed most among tributaries in mid-May when (1) water temperatures were more than 8 degrees C, (2) <b>smelts</b> peaked in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and (3) discharge peaked, stimulating <b>smelt</b> migration. <b>Smelts</b> captured after the migratory period had lower gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity than migrating smolts. Relating <b>smelt</b> physiology to migration was crucial for explaining complex interactions among water temperature, discharge, and <b>smelt</b> behavior during both the onset and cessation of migratory activity. Because the period between onset of migration and loss of <b>smelt</b> physiological characteristics may be brief, delays in downstream passage that may occur at dams must be minimized to maximize the successful recruitment of <b>smelts</b> to the marine environmen...|$|R

5|$|In 1529, Georgius Agricola {{described}} fluorite as an additive used {{to lower}} the melting point of metals during <b>smelting.</b> He penned the Latin word fluorés (fluor, flow) for fluorite rocks.

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by <b>smelting</b> because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the <b>smelting</b> process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and <b>smelting,</b> and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries.

5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper <b>smelting</b> in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal <b>smelting</b> in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron <b>smelting,</b> and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
