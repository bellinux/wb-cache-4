5|$|Shortly {{after her}} 17th {{birthday}} {{she changed her}} hair colour with a pink rinse. She took judo lessons once {{a week at a}} local school, but found partners reluctant to train with her, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> slow to release her grip. She took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for absenteeism after six months.|$|E
5|$|By 1976 Godwin was a {{successful}} writer and novelist who had published three books: The Perfectionists, Glass People, and The Odd Woman. The Odd Woman was the longest and most widely recognized of the three. Several short stories by Godwin were published in prominent magazines like Harper's Esquire, Ms. and the Paris Review, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> featured on the cover. Godwin was awarded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (1975–76) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1975–76).|$|E
5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> given an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{about his}} growing blindness, and not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute {{for the next}} six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. £40,000 was settled on her {{at the time of her}} {{marriage}} and she was due to inherit a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind and pleasant woman, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward. In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over £110,000.|$|E
5|$|Joanne Whalley, {{who played}} Emma Craven, began acting during childhood, {{appearing}} in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street (1960–present) in 1976 {{at the age of}} 10. She had also appeared in supporting roles in several series including Juliet Bravo (1980–1985), Bergerac (1981–1991) and Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983). Following Edge of Darkness, Whalley was cast in the equally well regarded BBC television serial The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter. Moving to Hollywood, she appeared in such films as Willow (1988), Scandal (1989) and Shattered (1991) as well as television mini-series such as Scarlett (1994) and Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (2000). During her eight-year marriage to the actor Val Kilmer, between 1988 and 1996, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> credited as Joanne Whalley-Kilmer.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E

5|$|The {{youngest}} {{child of the}} Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene in 1980 {{as a member of}} the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. Selena began recording professionally in 1982. In the 1980s, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. Selena signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and if anything, of higher social standing. They thought him too old for their daughter, her too young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan {{did not want to}} lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
