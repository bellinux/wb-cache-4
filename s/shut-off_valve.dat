500|$|The oil spill, located {{immediately}} {{north of}} Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, originated in a [...] diameter underground pipeline named Line 901 owned by Plains All American Pipeline. Crude oil produced by offshore platforms was transported from onshore receiving plants to another pipeline that transported the oil inland for processing. The oil pipeline operators in Midland, Texas had turned off an alarm {{that would have}} notified them of the leak as {{they were dealing with}} a separate problem with a pump. The 28 year old pipeline was not equipped with an automatic <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> and was eventually shut down by control operators when they were notified of the leak from parties who visually located the spill.|$|E
500|$|Before the spill, an {{inspection}} of the 28 year old Line 901 pipeline found extensive corrosion problems resulting in thinning pipeline walls. [...] The pipeline {{did not have an}} automatic <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> that would have been required on an intrastate pipeline as Line 901 is categorized as an interstate pipeline. Officials from Plains All American Pipeline claimed that installing a new valve would present other potential dangers. The line underwent a comprehensive internal inspection in July 2012 and since then the area where the pipe broke had been repaired at least three times. [...] Line 903 is a much longer pipeline that transports the oil from Line 901 inland to gathering facilities and refineries. LIne 903 was also found to be corroded though not as seriously.|$|E

50|$|On jetliners, air is {{supplied}} to the ECS by being bled from a compressor stage of each gas turbine engine, upstream of the combustor.

50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|E

50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic <b>shut-off</b> and bypass <b>valves</b> were installed for Plant 2. The <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014.

[...] After developing a prototype with his assistant, Paul Wenke, Corson gave the suggestion to the company who later filed for a patent in his name.

[...] This mechanism eventually developed into the modern gasoline pump cut-off valve.|$|E

25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf {{was concerned about}} the security of the collection – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves,</b> and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} an actuating device for opening and closing a shut-off fitting for pipes, said device automatically closing when a preset temperature is exceeded. In known automatically closing <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves,</b> complex measures are required to trigger the temperature monitoring function to prepare the valve for re-use. The actuating device according to the invention has a triggering device which prevents a first spring from shutting off the valve. The triggering device is formed such that, {{in the event of}} rising temperature, the spring releases {{as the result of a}} temperature-related change in position and/or change in length, which closes the valve. After a preset temperature is undershot, the triggering device returns to its original position. By a simple rotating movement, the temperature monitoring function of the actuating device can be re-activated. The actuating device in the invention can be easily attached to existing valves so that it is specially suited for retrofit ting existing valves...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid powertrains {{that use}} {{compressed}} air to help power a vehicle could dramatically improve the fuel economy, particularly {{in cities and}} urban areas where the traffic conditions involve a lot of starts and stops. In such conditions, {{a large amount of}} fuel is needed to accelerate the vehicle, and much of this is converted to heat in brake friction during decelerations. Capturing, storing and reusing this braking energy to produce additional power can therefore improve fuel efficiency. In this study, three approaches towards air hybrid powertrains are proposed and analyzed. In the first approach, an energy recovery <b>valve</b> or two <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> connected to a convenient access hole on the engine cylinder is proposed to enable the cylinder to operate as a regenerative compressor and/or expander when required. In the second approach, one of the exhaust valves in an engine equipped with a Fully Variable Valve Actuation (FVVA) system is pneumatically or hydraulically operated as a dedicated gas transfer valve connected to an air reservoir. The third approach combines the advantages of the conventional valvetrain’s simplicity with emerging production technologies. In order t...|$|R
