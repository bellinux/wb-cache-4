5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of <b>Styrofoam,</b> so when the environmental concerns over <b>Styrofoam</b> {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of <b>Styrofoam</b> in two months.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of <b>Styrofoam</b> are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and <b>styrofoam</b> insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light <b>Styrofoam</b> model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from a dealer in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the <b>styrofoam</b> rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.|$|E

25|$|The current city is the Republic of Egypt's leading port, a commercial, {{tourism and}} {{transportation}} center, {{and the heart}} of a major industrial area where refined petroleum, asphalt, cotton textiles, processed food, paper, plastics and <b>styrofoam</b> are produced.|$|E
25|$|McDLT – The McDLT (McDonald's Lettuce and Tomato) {{was sold}} in a novel form of packaging. The McDLT was {{introduced}} in the fall of 1984 as the Lettuce and Tomato Special. The meat and bottom half of the bun were prepared separately from the lettuce, tomato, American cheese, pickles, sauces, and top half of the bun. Both were then packaged into a specially designed two-sided <b>styrofoam</b> container. The consumer was then expected to finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. It was discontinued between December 1990 and January 1991 due to environmental concerns with <b>styrofoam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Styrofoam</b> cups release styrene as {{the food}} or drink is consumed. Leaded fuel is another {{hazardous}} chemical. Although {{it has been}} outlawed in the United States, its use in developing countries impacts the health of local people and the global environment.|$|E
25|$|Sikkim {{accounts}} for the largest share of cardamom production in India, and is the world's second largest producer of the spice after Guatemala. Sikkim has the highest share of agricultural land dedicated to organic farming in India. It is also among India's most environmentally conscious states, having banned plastic water bottles and <b>styrofoam</b> products.|$|E
25|$|For {{vermicomposting}} at home, a large {{variety of}} bins are commercially available, or {{a variety of}} adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, <b>Styrofoam,</b> or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fall}} 2014 semester, Oberlin's Student Labor Action Coalition {{organized}} {{a petition to}} permit dining hall temporary workers working four hour shifts to eat one meal from food the college throws out each day. The petition garnered over 1,000 signatures and resulted in workers obtaining the opportunity to put food into a management given <b>styrofoam</b> container to eat after their shifts.|$|E
25|$|Dow {{is a large}} {{producer}} of plastics, including polystyrene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polypropylene, and synthetic rubber. It is also a major {{producer of}} ethylene oxide, various acrylates, surfactants, and cellulose resins. It produces agricultural chemicals including the pesticide Lorsban and consumer products including <b>Styrofoam.</b> Some Dow consumer products including Saran wrap, Ziploc bags and Scrubbing Bubbles were sold to S. C. Johnson & Son in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{was elected}} to the Berkeley City Council while still a student and served from 1984-1992. She remains the only student ever elected to the City Council. During her time on the council, she helped {{establish}} Eastshore State Park, pushed for Berkeley to become the first city in the United States to have a 50% recycling goal, and authored legislation to ban <b>Styrofoam</b> at fast food businesses, the first such legislation in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Shadow's {{slightly}} tapered wings, {{which have}} down-turned wingtips and leading edges which droop towards the tip, consist of plywood leading edge D-section boxes, built onto mixed plywood and aluminium web shear structures with <b>styrofoam</b> formers. The {{rear of the}} wing is covered in polyester fabric. The wing carries Frise ailerons and three position flaps. The shorter span wings of the later Streak variants are built in the same way, but have no gap between the ailerons and flaps.|$|E
25|$|Some {{materials}} are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, {{are prone to}} rusting, and may release heavy metals into the vermicompost. <b>Styrofoam</b> containers may release chemicals into the organic material. Some cedars, Yellow cedar, and Redwood contain resinous oils that may harm worms, although Western Red Cedar has excellent longevity in composting conditions. Hemlock is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species {{that may be used}} to build worm bins.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene foams {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} {{and are therefore}} often used as building insulation materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated panel building systems. Grey polystyrene foam, incorporating graphite has superior insulation properties. They are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures (such as ornamental pillars). PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark <b>Styrofoam</b> by Dow Chemical Company is informally used (mainly US & Canada) for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for 'extruded closed-cell' polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{characteristic}} costumes {{are generally}} made of foam latex, <b>styrofoam,</b> and hardened rubber. The costumes cover {{very little of}} the band members' bodies; the bare parts are accentuated with makeup. They further their production in concert by spraying their audiences with fluids. Most of the fluids are made of water and powdered food coloring which, for the most part, flakes off or washes out easily. The thicker fluids are made from a clear seaweed extract called carrageenan, which is also used in ice cream and milkshakes. Gwar does not use syrups or stage blood because they dry solid and can damage the band's costumes.|$|E
25|$|Polymers are {{studied in}} the fields of {{biophysics}} and macromolecular science, and polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics). Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science; emerging important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber {{is an example of a}} natural/biological polymer, and the polystyrene of <b>styrofoam</b> is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components—e.g., isoprenylated/lipid-modified glycoproteins, where small lipidic molecules and oligosaccharide modifications occur on the polyamide backbone of the protein.|$|E
25|$|In any case, an {{efficient}} surveillance {{is essential to}} monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes {{and the effect of}} control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of Ae. albopictus. They are black water containers with floating <b>Styrofoam</b> blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.|$|E
25|$|Bryn Mawr {{has signed}} the American College and University President's Climate Commitment, {{and in doing}} so, the school agreed to make all new {{buildings}} comply with a LEED silver standard or higher; to purchase Energy Star products whenever possible; and to provide and {{encourage the use of}} public transportation. The school's dining halls strive to be environmentally sustainable by working to expand their local and organic offerings, recycling in all dining areas, and recycling used fry oil as bio-diesel fuel. The dining halls previously offered biodegradable takeout containers, but reverted to <b>Styrofoam</b> in the 2009/10 academic year. Additionally, all leftover food is donated to a local food bank. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Bryn Mawr received a C+. The school's highest category score was an A in Investment Priorities, since Bryn Mawr invests in renewable energy funds, but the score was brought down by lower grades in categories like Green Building (in which the school earned a D, since the campus currently features no green buildings).|$|E
25|$|The new layout {{was started}} in 2001, is of a {{double-track}} looped-8 design; but has been built around the walls, with several reversing loops, curved laminate benchwork, more than 2000 linear feet of track, and a scale model of Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. Scenery has been built {{with a mix of}} hydrocal and extruded <b>styrofoam</b> board, and North Coast Engineering (NCE) Digital Command Control has been installed to allow running of multiple trains without the need for complex relay systems. The layout also features working signals that display proper occupancy, as well as scale-sized lighting fixtures for night scenes. Additionally, a new On30 narrow gauge branchline is being constructed {{at one end of the}} layout, with plans to expand it as time and resources allow. Rolling stock is owned by the individual members, with the club jointly owning the layout and control system. This rolling stock represents all periods of history, and is a mixture of brass, bronze, tin, white metal, plastic, resin, wood, paper, cardboard, and die-cast models; most of which has been extensively kitbashed/modified, features custom paint and water-slide decals; and has been weathered to better replicate real-world conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{test was}} {{performed}} at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968 at the Watching Hill blast {{range of the}} Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility {{able to carry out}} large HE test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres but equal in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by <b>styrofoam</b> rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the flame front reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to ¾ inch in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring 270 feet across filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the ground effects.|$|E

500|$|Although many {{suggestions}} {{state that}} Comic Book Guy {{was inspired by}} the show's creator Matt Groening, Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who, according to Simpsons writer George Meyer, often [...] " [...] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big <b>Styrofoam</b> container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce." ...|$|E
500|$|At Atigun Pass, to {{the south}} of the Sag River, workers had to deal with a {{different}} set of challenges. In 1975, surveyors discovered the pass was filled with permafrost and glacial soils. But because the pass is the site of frequent avalanches, an elevated pipeline was not possible. The solution was to design a reinforced, insulated ditch to lay the pipeline in. The result was a 6,000-foot (1.83km) long concrete box lined with [...] of <b>Styrofoam.</b> The problem then became one of building it before the first snow started falling in October.|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground <b>Styrofoam</b> which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground <b>Styrofoam</b> stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E
500|$|The icy caverns {{featured}} in the episode were constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage; and required the use of truckloads of lumber and [...] of <b>Styrofoam.</b> The set {{would become one of}} the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history. The set required a constant temperature of [...] in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to [...] "have a place that feels real" [...] to aid their acting.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of V'Ger caused {{problems for the}} entire production. The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot clay model created by the Abel group, which looked like a modernized Nemo's Nautilus submarine. Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize {{a new version of}} the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. The final model was [...] long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, macramé, <b>Styrofoam</b> cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.|$|E
