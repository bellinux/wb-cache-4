25|$|The {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} predicts that if traversable wormholes exist, they can also alter the speed of time. They could allow time travel. This would be accomplished by accelerating {{one end of the}} wormhole to a high velocity relative to the other, and then sometime later bringing it back; relativistic time dilation would result in the accelerated wormhole mouth aging less than the stationary one as seen by an external observer, similar to what is seen in the twin paradox. However, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that <b>synchronized</b> <b>clocks</b> at each mouth will remain synchronized to someone traveling through the wormhole itself, no matter how the mouths move around. This means that anything which entered the accelerated wormhole mouth would exit the stationary one at a point in time prior to its entry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Synchronizing</b> <b>clocks</b> is an {{integral}} part of modern network and security architectures. However, the ability to <b>synchronize</b> <b>clocks</b> in modern networks is not well-understood. In this work, we use testbeds equipped with a high-accuracy GPS receiver to acquire ground truth, to study the accuracy of probe-based synchronization techniques to over 1861 public time servers. We find that existing synchronization protocols provide a median error of 2 − 5 ms, but suffer from a long-tail. We analyze sources of inaccuracy by decoupling and quantifying different network factors. We found that most inaccuracies stem from asymmetry of propagation delay and queueing delay. We discuss possible schemes to compensate these errors to improve synchronization accuracy. ...|$|R

A bit of manipulation allows one to show that proper velocity w = dx/dτ = γv where as usual coordinate velocity v = dx/dt. Thus finite w ensures that v is less than lightspeed c. By grouping γ with v in the expression for relativistic momentum p, proper velocity also extends the Newtonian form of momentum as mass times velocity to high speeds without a need for relativistic mass.|$|E
