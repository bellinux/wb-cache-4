6000|$|From a {{communication}} {{printed in the}} [...] "Athenæum" [...] of Feb. 4, 1893, extracts from the original proof-sheets, it seems that Lockhart forgot the original plan of the novel. The mock marriage did halt at the church door, but Clara's virtue had yielded to her real lover, Tyrrel, before the ceremony. Hannah Irwin had deliberately made opportunities for the lovers' meeting, and at last, as <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cancelled passage, [...] "the devil and Hannah Irwin prevailed." [...] There followed remorse, and a determination not to meet again before the Church made them one, and, {{on the head of}} this, the mock marriage shook Clara's reason. This was the original plan; it declares itself in the scene between Tyrrel and Clara (vol. i. chap, ix.): [...] "Wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and folly?" [...] The reviewer in the [...] "Monthly Review" [...] (1824) says [...] "there is a hint of some deeper cause of grief (see the confession to the brother), but it is highly problematical." [...] For all this the delicacy of James Ballantyne is to blame--his delicacy, and Scott's concessions to a respectable man and a bad critic.|$|E

6000|$|Well! I {{tried to}} settle to my tea but I {{could not do}} it what with {{thinking}} of Miss Wozenham and her distresses. It was a wretched night and I went up to a front window and looked over at Wozenham's and as well as I could make it out {{down the street in}} the fog it was the dismallest of the dismal and not a light to be seen. So at last I save to myself [...] "This will not do," [...] and I puts on my oldest bonnet and shawl not wishing Miss Wozenham to be reminded of my best at such a time, and lo and behold you I goes over to Wozenham's and knocks. [...] "Miss Wozenham at home?" [...] I says turning my head when I heard the door go. And then I saw it was Miss Wozenham herself who had opened it and sadly worn she was poor thing and her eyes all swelled and swelled with crying. [...] "Miss Wozenham" [...] I says [...] "it is several years since there was a little unpleasantness betwixt us on the subject of my grandson's cap being down your Airy. I have overlooked it and I hope you have done the same." [...] "Yes Mrs. Lirriper" [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> surprise, [...] "I have." [...] "Then my dear" [...] I says [...] "I should be glad to come in and speak a word to you." [...] Upon my calling her my dear Miss Wozenham breaks out a crying most pitiful, and a not unfeeling elderly person that might have been better shaved in a nightcap with a hat over it offering a polite apology for the mumps having worked themselves into his constitution, and also for sending home to his wife on the bellows which was in his hand as a writing-desk, looks out of the back parlour and says [...] "The lady wants a word of comfort" [...] and goes in again. So I was able to say quite natural [...] "Wants a word of comfort does she sir? Then please the pigs she shall have it!" [...] And Miss Wozenham and me we go into the front room with a wretched light that seemed to have been crying too and was sputtering out, and I says [...] "Now my dear, tell me all," [...] and she wrings her hands and says [...] "O Mrs. Lirriper that man is in possession here, and I have not a friend in the world who is able to help me with a shilling." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of Özdamar’s {{identifiers}} is her unique language, {{which she}} created partially through a literal translation of Turkish expressions or catchwords, through playing with philosophical and literary quotations, and the Broken German {{used by the}} guest workers. The result was: “Deutschland, ein Wörtermärchen" [...] (Germany, a Words-Fairytale—a play on Heine's Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen). [...] "Damals kam ich auf die Idee von Deutschland als Tür, durch die man hinein- oder hinausgeht. Und auf die Frage: Was passiert dabei mit der Sprache?" [...] (Back then, an idea came to me of Germany as a door, through which one walks in or walks out.

5000|$|After {{gaining access}} to Cécile's bedchamber on a false pretense, Valmont forces himself upon her as she pleads with him to leave. On the pretext of illness Cécile remains locked in her chambers, refusing all visitors. A {{concerned}} Madame de Volanges calls upon Merteuil to speak to her. Cécile, naively assuming that Merteuil has her best interests at heart, confides in her. Merteuil advises Cécile to welcome Valmont's advances; young women should take advantage of all the lovers they can acquire, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society so repressive and contemptuous of women. The result is a perverse [...] "student-teacher" [...] relationship; by day, Cécile is courted by Danceny, and each night she receives a sexual [...] "lesson" [...] from Valmont. In the meantime, Merteuil begins an affair with Danceny.|$|E

When they find something, they discover that they need different items. Duck arrives and gives Spyler and CeCe four (or sometimes three) items to find, which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rhyme. Spyler and CeCe then start searching for the items. After each item is found they sing their [...] "Whoop! We Found It!" [...] song. Duck arrives again and tells them what they have found and what they need to find in rhyme. Spyler also calls for Wheeler to take their stuff home. After all the items are found, Spyler and CeCe do their activity/task. They always find a use for every item.|$|E
5000|$|The novel draws {{heavily on}} the theme of identity; http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10815381 of how we see others, how we judge on {{appearances}} and what we choose to reveal (or hide) about ourselves.

He asks Manny (Rico Rodriguez) if he thinks she did anything, which he initially denies. At night, Jay and Manny go to the garage to look for evidence of the dog's murder. Manny rats out Jay's plan to Gloria making her very angry. Gloria tells Jay that she gave the dog to a friend for a jar of pickles. To make her happy, Jay buys plane tickets to Colombia to see what her village is like. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview <b>she</b> does not want to go to her old village as it will prove Jay right.|$|R
5000|$|... "Let's Forget About It" [...] {{is a song}} by Lisa Loeb {{from her}} 1997 album Firecracker. It is about a mistake that she has made in a relationship, and she just wants her and her boyfriend to forget about it. There is a lyric where she says, [...] "I'll stop crying on the {{mountain}} that we made from the molehill where we spilled the milk". In other words, she is saying there is no use crying over spilled milk, which means {{not to worry about}} the little things in life. The lyrics of last line <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> request form, [...] "I'll stop crying if you'll stop lying to me." [...] The song is also on Loeb's 2006 greatest hits album, The Very Best of Lisa Loeb. The single peaked at #39 on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream chart, #38 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart, #71 on The Billboard Hot 100, and #18 on the American Top 40 radio show/chart.|$|E
40|$|The artist Ingrid Mwangi {{was born}} to a Kenyan father and a German mother and has lived in both Africa and Europe. Identifying herself as a “hyphenated person ” and {{displaying}} the inherent problematics of racially based notions of national identity, Mwangi presents her own body as the troubled unity of both subject and object in her art. Michael J. C. Echeruo (1999 : 10) maintains that choosing a subjective identity is absurd, for identity is constructed from the subject but is also everything the subject is not. It is through this approach to identity as construct that Ingrid Mwangi performs her identity by creating herself as a site of discourse. When <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> commentary on her 2001 work Coloured, “I am the stage, ” she posits her own body as {{the location of a}} discourse that is dependant on the confused racial signifiers of skin colour. The body politics of cultural framing are enacted in her works, denying any sense of stability or unity. She confronts the viewer’s understanding of racial categories through the constant affirmation/denial of her bodily self. In this paper, I examine Mwangi’s performance and installation works as critiques on the placement/role of the physical body in identity discourse...|$|E

[...] In her latest project, There Goes the Neighborhood, Carlo {{continues}} {{to use her}} own experiences to reflect New York City's ever-evolving nature. The 55-minute solo performance revolves around her struggle {{to find a new}} apartment after being forced out of the one she had lived in for twenty years, and in doing so touches on issues of gentrification in Brooklyn. At one point in the show, she describes riding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car with a realtor who, not realizing that Carlo herself is Puerto Rican, tells her, [...] "I don't recommend that you take an apartment above 10th street, dear...That's where all the Puerto Ricans live." [...] This personal account provides evidence of the physical and social boundaries that obviously still exist within many New York neighborhoods, and in doing so speaks directly to Carlo's Latinx audience (especially those who may be white-passing).|$|R

40|$|University of East Anglia {{child health}} nursing {{lecturer}} Katie McGhee {{has responded to}} <b>a</b> letter published <b>in</b> International Airport Review. Sent by Rachel Humphrey, from Hampshire, the letter describes how she, her husband and their 14 -yearold son, who has diabetes, were held for two hours at Dubai International Airport last June after they declined to disconnect their son’s insulin pump or {{allow it to be}} X-rayed. Previously they had been allowed through security with a wand inspection. Ms McGhee says that there is debate on whether travellers with diabetes should detach and show their pumps to security personnel or wait to be questioned after the pumps set off metal detector alarms. The pumps should not be exposed to total body scanners or X-rays because they can damage the pumps’ electronics and cause malfunctions, affecting insulin delivery. ‘The risk of increased stress for people with insulin pumps at airport security departments and the potential for subsequent life-threatening emergencies require urgent airport authority attention,’ <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> article <b>in</b> the journal.
