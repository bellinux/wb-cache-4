Lerner and A. von Eye (see record 1992 - 23071 - 001) misunderstand the role of general theory in science. They also fail to characterize the work of <b>sociobiologists</b> accurately and inaccurately portray the current power of behavior genetic research...|$|R
50|$|Human <b>sociobiologists</b> try to {{understand}} how maximizing genetic fitness, in either the modern era or past environments, can explain human behavior. When faced with a trait that seems maladaptive, some <b>sociobiologists</b> try {{to determine how the}} trait actually increases genetic fitness (maybe through kin selection or by speculating about early evolutionary environments). Dual inheritance theorists, in contrast, will consider a variety of genetic and cultural processes in addition to natural selection on genes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sociobiologists</b> place communal, quasisocial, and semisocial animals into a meta-class: the parasocial. What parasocial taxa have {{in common}} is that they socialize in a single, {{cooperative}} dwelling.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sociobiologists</b> {{believe that}} human behavior, {{as well as}} nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly {{explained}} as the outcome of natural selection. They contend {{that in order to}} fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.|$|R
50|$|Sexologist Alfred Kind {{suggested}} that the buttocks is the primary sexual presentation site in primates. Some anthropologists and <b>sociobiologists</b> believe that breast fetishism derives from the breasts' similarity to buttocks, but instead provide sexual attraction {{from the front of}} the body.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sociobiologists</b> are {{interested}} in how behavior can be explained logically {{as a result of}} selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in instinctive, or intuitive behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of mammals - including humans - are very protective of their offspring. <b>Sociobiologists</b> reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral adaptations, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.|$|R
50|$|The term's {{contracted}} form biodiversity {{may have}} been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 National Forum on Biological Diversity organized by the National Research Council (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when <b>sociobiologist</b> E. O. Wilson used it {{as the title of}} the proceedings of that forum.|$|E
5000|$|... "Epic of Evolution" [...] {{seems to}} have {{originated}} from the <b>sociobiologist</b> Edward O. Wilson's use of the phrase [...] "evolutionary epic" [...] in 1978. Wilson {{was not the first}} to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{rare case}} of agreement, feminist pioneer Betty Friedan and Harvard <b>sociobiologist</b> Edward O. Wilson both see Eve's Seed as a {{ground-breaking}} work {{that will change}} the way we see the human condition. [...] "Eve's Seed signals a significant paradigm shift,” Friedan wrote, and Wilson said, [...] "a new field is stirring to life" [...] with the book.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer's {{controversial}} writings {{have influenced}} many, from Friedrich Nietzsche to nineteenth-century feminists. Schopenhauer's biological {{analysis of the}} difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by <b>sociobiologists</b> and evolutionary psychologists.|$|R
50|$|An {{animal that}} {{exhibits}} {{a high degree}} of sociality is called a social animal. The highest degree of sociality recognized by <b>sociobiologists</b> is eusociality. A eusocial taxon is one that exhibits overlapping adult generations, reproductive division of labor, cooperative care of young, and—in the most refined cases—a biological caste system.|$|R
50|$|Sociobiology has {{remained}} highly controversial as it contends genes explain specific human behaviours, although <b>sociobiologists</b> describe this {{role as a}} very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture. The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Ludlow [...] "Bob" [...] Trivers ( [...] ; born February 19, 1943) is an American {{evolutionary}} {{biologist and}} <b>sociobiologist,</b> {{who is a}} Professor of Anthropology and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University. Trivers proposed the theories of reciprocal altruism (1971), parental investment (1972), facultative sex ratio determination (1973), and parent-offspring conflict (1974). He has also contributed by explaining self-deception as an adaptive evolutionary strategy (first described in 1976) and discussing intragenomic conflict.|$|E
50|$|His work spanned various {{fields of}} theory and research, {{including}} migration and underdevelopment, social inequality and change, political sociology, the sociological classics, the philosophy of science, and evolutionary demography, among others. Joseph Lopreato {{was one of the}} first sociologists to take up the challenge from behavioral evolutionary biology ("sociobiology") to work toward a synthesis of the biological and sociocultural disciplines. He is accordingly best known for his work as a human <b>sociobiologist.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Lopreato (July 13, 1928 in Stefanaconi, Italy - March 25, 2015 in Georgetown, Texas, United States) was a <b>sociobiologist,</b> {{a social}} theorist, and a {{professor}} of sociology. [...] After receiving his Ph.D. from Yale University (1960) he taught and lectured at various universities in the USA and abroad, and published a dozen books and monographs plus numerous papers in several languages. He died in Georgetown, Texas, on March 25, 2015, and is buried in Austin, Texas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sociobiologists</b> have a {{different}} theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative. According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection, the biological {{differences between men and}} women meant that many more children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children. Thus, Harris and others, such as William Divale, see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while <b>sociobiologists</b> such as Mildred Dickemann view the same practice as a means of expanding it.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately these {{analyses}} were considered unsuccessful, and were specifically criticized by other <b>sociobiologists</b> {{on a number}} of grounds. One problem was said to be that interpreting inclusive fitness theory to imply that individuals have evolved the characteristic of pursuing strategies to maximize their own 'inclusive fitness' is erroneous; the theory should instead be interpreted to describe selection pressures on genes: ...|$|R
5000|$|Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape is a 1975 {{book about}} rape by Susan Brownmiller, {{in which the}} author argues that rape is [...] "a {{conscious}} process of intimidation by which all men keep all women {{in a state of}} fear." [...] Brownmiller's book is widely credited with changing public outlooks and attitudes about rape, but her arguments were rejected or criticized by <b>sociobiologists,</b> and others.|$|R
5000|$|Naturalist is an {{autobiography}} by naturalist, entomologist, and <b>sociobiologist</b> Edward O. Wilson {{first published in}} 1994 by Island Press. In it he writes on his childhood and the beginnings of his interest in biology, on his work in entomology and myrmecology, on his work with biogeography, and on several of his writings including on his controversial work Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, {{as well as several}} other subjects. [...] It was awarded the 1995 Los Angeles Times book prize for Science and Technology publication.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{this early}} {{emphasis}} on developmental processes, theories of evolution and theories of development {{have long been}} viewed as separate, or even opposed to one another (for additional background, see nature versus nurture). Since {{the advent of the}} modern evolutionary synthesis, evolutionary theory has been primarily [...] "gene-centric", and developmental processes have often been seen as incidental. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins' appraisal of development in 1973 illustrates this shift: [...] "The details of embryological developmental processes, interesting as they may be, are irrelevant to evolutionary considerations." [...] Similarly, <b>sociobiologist</b> E.O. Wilson regarded ontogenetic variation as [...] "developmental noise".|$|E
50|$|On the {{traditional}} view, {{an explanation of}} economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned {{at this point to}} whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? <b>sociobiologists?).</b> On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.|$|R
50|$|Parallels {{can then}} be drawn, on a purely {{speculative}} level, between our moral faculties and language, as {{has been done by}} <b>sociobiologists</b> such as E. O. Wilson and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker. The relative consistency of fundamental notions of morality across cultures seems to produce convincing evidence for these theories. In psychology, notions of archetypes such as those developed by Carl Jung, suggest determinate identity perceptions.|$|R
50|$|Schiebinger {{has also}} accused <b>sociobiologists</b> of {{producing}} the “corporate primate”, described as “female baboons with briefcases, strategically competitive and aggressive.” This {{contrasts with the}} notion that only men are competitive and aggressive. Observations have repeatedly demonstrated that female apes and monkeys also form stable dominance hierarchies and alliances with their male counterparts. Females display aggression, exercise sexual choice, and compete for resources, mates and territory, like their male counterparts.|$|R
5000|$|Wright goes on {{to discuss}} various aspects of {{evolutionary}} learning in numerous contexts. This ultimately leads {{to the question of}} whether man's information systems are still evolving, or did they simply stop when we reached our current evolutionary state. Wright looks for a possible answer in the work of <b>sociobiologist</b> E.O. Wilson and his theory of gene-culture co-evolution and 'epigenetic rules': [...] "Epigenetic rules come in two flavors: primary epigenetic rules govern our immediate sense perceptions, such as our universal tendency to perceive the color spectrum in four basic color groups...; secondary epigenetic rules operate at a higher level of abstraction such as the tendency for all human beings to classify objects into opposing pairs like black and white, life and death, heaven and earth—notions that have no physical component in the human brain, yet seem to recur across human cultures." ...|$|E
50|$|Biology {{has become}} Darwinian, but belief {{in some form}} of {{progress}} (orthogenesis) remains both in the public mind and among biologists. Ruse argues that evolutionary biologists will probably continue to believe in progress for three reasons. Firstly, the anthropic principle demands people able to ask about the process that led to their own existence, {{as if they were the}} pinnacle of such progress. Secondly, scientists in general and evolutionists in particular believe that their work is leading them progressively closer to a true grasp of reality, as knowledge increases, and hence (runs the argument) there is progress in nature also. Ruse notes in this regard that Richard Dawkins explicitly compares cultural progress with memes to biological progress with genes. Thirdly, evolutionists are self-selected; they are people, such as the entomologist and <b>sociobiologist</b> E. O. Wilson, who are interested in progress to supply a meaning for life.|$|E
5000|$|Culturgen {{is a term}} coined in 1980 by two American scientists, the biomathematician Charles J. Lumsden and the <b>sociobiologist</b> E. O. Wilson, {{to denote}} a {{hypothetical}} 'unit' of culture, in their controversial attempt to analyse cultural evolution by using techniques borrowed from population genetics, and to infer a theory of evolution of the human mind. It effectively means {{much the same as}} the older term [...] "cultural trait" [...] used by anthropologists, and offers similar difficulties of identification and definition. The fullest exposition of their theory appeared in their book Genes, Mind, and Culture: the coevolutionary process (1981), which received many reviews in the scientific press, many of them highly negative; it was re-issued in 2005 with a review of subsequent developments. The term has declined in popularity, and the older term meme (coined by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene (1976)) is now used in its stead almost universally (even by Wilson in his later writings).|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of modern morality {{is a process}} closely tied to sociocultural evolution. Some evolutionary biologists, particularly <b>sociobiologists,</b> believe that morality {{is a product of}} evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some <b>sociobiologists</b> contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival and/or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved [...] "pro-social" [...] emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors. On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically-driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.|$|R
50|$|Early {{developments}} of biological inclusive fitness {{theory and the}} derivative field of Sociobiology, encouraged some <b>sociobiologists</b> and evolutionary psychologists to approach human kinship {{with the assumption that}} inclusive fitness theory predicts that kinship relations in humans are indeed expected to depend on genetic relatedness, which they readily connected with the genealogy approach of early anthropologists such as Morgan (see above sections). However, this is the position that Schneider, Sahlins and other anthropologists explicitly reject.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMass culture {{generally}} assumes {{there is}} a fixed, true masculinity beneath {{the ebb and flow}} of daily life. We hear of ‘real men’, ‘natural man’, the ‘deep masculine’.
