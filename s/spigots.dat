5|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} {{except those}} that have been modified to form one to four (usually three) pairs of short, movable spinnerets, which emit silk. Each spinneret has many <b>spigots,</b> each of which is connected to one silk gland. There are at least six types of silk gland, each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 <b>spigots,</b> each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted <b>spigots.</b> It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

25|$|Each bail {{is made of}} {{a single}} cylindrically shaped piece of wood which has two smaller {{cylinders}} of wood protruding from each end. The large central cylinder is called the barrel and the smaller protrusions are the <b>spigots.</b> The <b>spigots</b> are of unequal length: the longer rests alone on one stump, while the shorter rests on the middle stump together with the short spigot of the other bail.|$|E
25|$|The {{cribellum}} is a silk spinning organ {{found in}} certain spiders. Unlike normal spinnerets, the cribellum consists {{of one or}} more plates covered in thousands of tiny <b>spigots.</b> These <b>spigots</b> produce extremely fine fibers which are combed out by the spider's calamistrum, producing silk with a woolly texture. The fibers are so small in diameter that prey insects easily become entangled in them, without any glue needed. The spiders then bite them before they can escape. The cribellum is a functional homolog of the anterior median spinnerets of Mesothelae and Mygalomorphae, which do not have a cribellum.|$|E

50|$|A near-silent mortar {{can operate}} using the <b>spigot</b> principle. Each round has a {{close-fitting}} sliding plug in the tube that fits over the <b>spigot.</b> When the round is fired, the projectile is pushed off the <b>spigot,</b> {{but before the}} plug clears the <b>spigot</b> it is caught by a constriction {{at the base of}} the tube. This traps the gases from the propelling charge and hence the sound of the firing. After World War II the Belgium Fly-K silent <b>spigot</b> mortar was accepted into French service as the TN-8111.|$|R
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} {{hits the}} stumps and if {{at least one}} bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, the striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in the stump's <b>spigots).</b> The ball can either have struck the stumps directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting the stumps. The batsman is not out if the bails remain on the stumps.|$|E

500|$|The oldest known {{exclusively}} terrestrial arachnid is the trigonotarbid Palaeotarbus jerami, {{from about}} [...] in the Silurian period, {{and had a}} triangular cephalothorax and segmented abdomen, as well as eight legs {{and a pair of}} pedipalps. Attercopus fimbriunguis, from [...] in the Devonian period, bears the earliest known silk-producing <b>spigots,</b> and was therefore hailed as a spider {{at the time of its}} discovery. However, these <b>spigots</b> may have been mounted on the underside of the abdomen rather than on spinnerets, which are modified appendages and whose mobility is important in the building of webs. Hence Attercopus and the similar Permian arachnid Permarachne may not have been true spiders, and probably used silk for lining nests or producing egg-cases rather than for building webs. The largest known fossil spider as of 2011 is the araneid Nephila jurassica, from about , recorded from Daohuogo, Inner Mongolia in China. Its body length is almost 25mm, (i.e., almost one inch).|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} a {{multiple}} 'spigot mortar' or <b>spigot</b> discharger, {{a type of}} weapon developed between the wars by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker, RA. The <b>spigot</b> mortar was based on early infantry trench mortars. The <b>spigot</b> design allowed a single device to fire warheads of varying size. The propelling charge {{was part of the}} main weapon and worked against a rod (the <b>spigot)</b> set in the baseplate which fitted inside a tubular tail of the 'bomb'. This principle was first used on the Blacker Bombard 29 mm <b>Spigot</b> Mortar and the later PIAT anti-tank weapon.|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of dense medium cyclones is often restricted by the solids-carrying {{capacity of}} the underflow, referred to as <b>spigot</b> capacity. Cyclone manufacturers normally recommend the <b>spigot</b> capacity for a cyclone of a particular size; however, {{it is not clear}} how these capacities are determined and whether they can be increased. In the literature, <b>spigot</b> capacity has previously been associated with roping flow at the underflow, although this notion has neither been clearly proven nor disproved. Furthermore, the effect of overloading the <b>spigot</b> on the operation of a dense medium cyclone has not been adequately studied. In this study, test-work on a 165 mm diameter dense medium cyclone was performed to investigate its <b>spigot</b> overloading behaviour. This work established clearly that <b>spigot</b> capacity was reached at the onset of roping flow, and that there was a critical underflow ore concentration at which roping/spigot overloading occurred. This ore concentration was shown to be a useful tool in anticipating and avoiding <b>spigot</b> overloading. <b>Spigot</b> capacities obtained in this study were higher than those specified in the DSM handbook, indicating that dense medium cyclone could possibly be operated at higher <b>spigot</b> capacities. However, separation efficiencies were not monitored during this investigation...|$|R
