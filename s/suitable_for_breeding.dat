5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> than {{traditional}} hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers. Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Drained and fertilised silage fields are less <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.|$|E

The poor soil of Asnières, where heather grew in Medieval times, was probably deemed only <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>breeding</b> of donkeys.|$|R
30|$|Essentially, the genomic and genic SSR and SNP markers {{developed}} {{especially by}} Indian initiatives {{are amenable to}} large-scale validation and high-throughput genotyping at the whole genome level.

2500|$|It was {{proposed}} that the Scottish Wildlife Trust might take over the isle as a reserve, however [...] {{the decline of the}} tern colony led to this proposal being rejected. [...] The hypothesis that the gulls were responsible for the loss of the terns is unfounded. [...] It is more likely, though not certain, that the reduction in breeding terns across the whole of the Clyde area is due to a combination of reduced feeding grounds and limited habitats <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> due to human development.

2500|$|The Nuragic economy, {{at least}} at the origins, was mostly based on {{agriculture}} (new studies suggest that they were the first to practice viticulture in the western Mediterranean) and animal husbandry, as well as on fishing.

Probably, as in other human communities that have the cattle as traditional economic base, the property of this established social hierarchies.|$|R
40|$|Coastal and estuarine {{habitats}} {{are important}} and nowadays sensitive systems. Dykes have been built to harvest land from the sea, cities and ports were developed, sea-arms were dammed and beaches and dunes "flooded" with recreants.

50|$|During the 20th century {{there were}} several periods {{when the number of}} Karst Shephards was low.

50|$|In 1853, Wiesenbauschule {{landscaping}} {{school was}} established, which soon {{gained a reputation}} outside of its local area. Here, landscaping and land improvements including irrigation techniques and the drainage of meadows were taught, so as to help enhance the yields from farmland. This was of particular importance in the Siegerland region because the high demand for charcoal for the regional ironworks meant that most areas were woodland. As a result, limited areas were <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> cattle <b>breeding,</b> so that research into enhancing the yields from the limited amount of meadowland had to be researched.|$|R

40|$|First pod {{height is}} an {{important}} trait, especially for snap bean since it enables the mechanical harvesting. Cultivars with low first pod height may be cut, damaged or not harvested by mechanical harvesting. In our investigation six different snap bean genotypes were used for examination of the first pod height and diallel analysis. The result was obtained by using method 2 model 1 GRIFFING (1956) for analysis of combining abilities. The mode of inheritance was different, as the results showed - from intermediate to super dominance, for both generations (F 1 and F 2). Analysis of combining abilities showed both influence of additive and dominant gene effects.

50|$|The Tasmanian masked owl is {{considered}} to be endangered under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, because of its small population (estimated at about 1330 breeding birds, or 615 pairs) as well as ongoing habitat loss, especially of old-growth forest <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding.</b> An important conservation need is to maintain nesting habitat in production forests. It is also threatened by competition for nest hollows by feral bees, kookaburras and possums.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate in}} Kepahiang is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> {{various kinds of}} land animals and fish.

Therefore, the potential remains largely untapped. Besides pisciculture, diary and slaughter cattles, goats, ducks and chicken are bred in Kepahiang as well. The livestock and fish farming is being funded under the program IKUTT serving as an additional source of income for locals.|$|E
50|$|For the males, this {{establishes}} if {{they are}} <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> the bullfight, or will be slaughtered for meat. The testing for the bullfight is only of their aggression towards the horse, as regulations forbid their charging {{a man on the}} ground before they enter the bullfighting ring. They learn how to use their horns in tests of strength and dominance with other bulls. Due to their special aggression, these combats can lead to severe injuries and even the death of bulls at great cost to the breeder.|$|E
40|$|An {{expedition}} {{to a remote}} area of Morocco’s Atlantic Sahara region was undertaken from February 13 to 26, 2015.

5000|$|According to the {{notification}} for the site, {{the interest}} of Sevenoaks Gravel Pits centres on its breeding bird populations. [...] The combination of water features such as shallows, spits and islands, {{as well as the}} planting of trees and aquatic plants, have provided conditions <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> both <b>breeding</b> and wintering birds. The water levels in the lake are managed so that islands and shallows are exposed during spring and summer, creating feeding and nesting areas for a variety of waders and water fowl including the little ringed plover, lapwing, moorhen, coot and great crested grebe. Large numbers of wildfowl regularly use the open water in the winter months such as the tufted duck, greylag and Canada geese.|$|R

50|$|It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss {{as a result of}} quartz and tormaline mining, logging as well as the clearing of its habitat through slash-and-burn techniques for subsistence agriculture.

50|$|Licensing, {{a process}} by which {{a panel of experts}} determines whether a young {{stallion}} is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> began in association with the State Stud at Celle in the mid-19th century. Locals complained that there were many privately owned stallions of poor quality offered at stud in the Kingdom of Hannover. In 1844, under King Earnest Augustus I, an ordinance made it illegal to accept money for stud services of a privately owned stallions without the stallion being inspected and issued a license by a royal committee, the Körkommission. The original körkommission was composed of two to three landowners, a cavalry officer, and a veterinarian. This process had the desired effect of eliminating major heritable defects, and helped Celle remain the most prominent source of breeding stallions.|$|E
