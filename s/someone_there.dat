Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E

Krycek informs the Smoking Man (William B. Davis) of these findings before departing with Mulder. When they arrive, Mulder boards the resort's aerial tramway in the hopes of reaching its peak before Barry. However, Krycek tries to delay Mulder by sabotaging the tramway's journey upward.

500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's <b>someone</b> <b>there</b> that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you."

500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see <b>someone</b> <b>there</b> who can stand toe to toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 midterms.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need <b>someone</b> <b>there</b> to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

500|$|Back home, Kennedy {{played with}} the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942–43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with {{teaching}} him how to [...] "operate {{in front of the}} net". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, [...] "Well, you know, Ted, if you turn pro, {{it will have to be}} with the Canadiens." [...] Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him [...] "a coming great", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first worried about what he may have done wrong, but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had <b>someone</b> <b>there</b> to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about {{the essence of}} the cocaine business, Escobar replied with [...] " [...] simple: you bribe someone here, you bribe <b>someone</b> <b>there,</b> and you pay a friendly banker to help you bring the money back." [...] In 1989, Forbes magazine estimated Escobar to be one of 227 billionaires in the world with a personal net worth of close to US $3 billion while his Medellín Cartel controlled 80% of the global cocaine market. It is commonly believed that Escobar was the principal financier behind Medellín's Atlético Nacional, which won South America's most prestigious football tournament, the Copa Libertadores, in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Goldsmith {{found work}} at CBS {{as a clerk}} typist in the network's music {{department}} under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as CBS Radio Workshop, Frontier Gentleman, and Romance. [...] In an interview with Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated, [...] "It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. But {{you had to be}} an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew <b>someone</b> <b>there</b> who said I'd be great for this. I'd just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. Then I could do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, and gave me a job." [...] He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as Climax! and Playhouse 90. [...] He also scored multiple episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to MGM Studios for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live television and would later compose music for such television shows as Dr. Kildare and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..|$|E

2500|$|Several months later, Louise de Kérouaille came to England from France, {{ostensibly to}} serve as a maid of honour to Queen Catherine, but also to become another {{mistress}} to King Charles, probably by design on both the French and English sides. She and Gwyn would prove rivals for many years to come. They were opposites in personality and mannerism; Louise a proud woman of noble birth used to the sophistication of Versailles, Nell a spirited and pranking ex-orange-wench. Gwyn nicknamed Louise [...] "Squintabella" [...] for her looks and the [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] for her tendencies to sob. In one instance, recorded in a letter from George Legge to Lord Preston, Nell characteristically jabbed at the Duchess's [...] "great lineage," [...] dressing in black at Court, the same mourning attire as Louise, when a prince of France died. [...] <b>Someone</b> <b>there</b> asked, [...] "What the deuce was the Cham of Tartary to you?" [...] to which Nell responded, [...] "Oh, exactly the same relation that the French Prince was to Mademoiselle de Kérouaille." [...] The Duchess of Portsmouth's only recorded riposte was, [...] "anybody may know she has been an orange-wench by her swearing" [...] Their relationship was not strictly adversarial; they were known to get together for tea and cards, for example. Basset was the popular game at the time, and Gwyn was a frequent — and high-stakes — gambler.|$|E
