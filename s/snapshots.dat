5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect {{the consistency of}} the UFS filesystem (widely used on the BSDs) {{in the event of a}} system crash. Filesystem <b>snapshots</b> allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. <b>Snapshots</b> allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Snapshot</b> {{isolation}} {{is a popular}} transactional isolation level in database systems. Several replication techniques based on <b>snapshot</b> isolation have recently been proposed. These proposals, however, do not fully leverage the local concurrency controls that provide <b>snapshot</b> isolation. Furthermore, guaranteeing <b>snapshot</b> isolation in lazy replicated systems may result in transaction inversions, which happen when transactions see stale data. Strong <b>snapshot</b> isolation, which is provided in centralized database servers, avoids transaction inversions but is expensive to provide in a lazy replicated system. In this paper, we show how <b>snapshot</b> isolation can be maintained in lazy replicated systems while taking {{full advantage of the}} local concurrency controls. We propose strong session <b>snapshot</b> isolation, a correctness criterion that prevents transaction inversions. We show how strong session <b>snapshot</b> isolation can be implemented efficiently in alazy replicated database system. Through performance studies, we quantify the cost of implementing our techniques in lazy replicated systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Snapshot</b> is a {{fundamental}} notion proposed for routing in mobile low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks which is characterized with predictable topology dynamics. Its distribution has {{a great impact on}} the routing performance and on-board storage. Originally, the <b>snapshot</b> distribution is invariable by using the static <b>snapshot</b> partition method based on the mechanical steering antenna. Utilizing nowadays advanced phased-array antenna technology, we proposed a quasi-dynamic <b>snapshot</b> partition method based on the inter-satellite links (ISLs) reassignment for the polar-orbit LEO satellite networks. By steering the inter-satellite antennas when <b>snapshot</b> switches, we can reassign the ISLs and add available ISLs for a better following <b>snapshot.</b> Results show that our method can gain more stable routing performance by obtaining constant <b>snapshot</b> duration, constant ISL number and lower end to end delay. Especially for Iridium system, our method can gain not only longer merged <b>snapshot</b> duration, half of the <b>snapshot</b> number, but also higher utilization ratio of inter-plane ISLs. Potentially, our method could be very useful for the Iridium-next system. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy.

50|$|A Btrfs <b>snapshot</b> is a {{subvolume}} that shares {{its data}} (and metadata) {{with some other}} subvolume, using Btrfs' copy-on-write capabilities, and modifications to a <b>snapshot</b> are not visible in the original subvolume. Once a writable <b>snapshot</b> is made, it can be treated as an alternate version of the original file system. For example, to roll back to a <b>snapshot,</b> a modified original subvolume needs to be unmounted and the <b>snapshot</b> needs to be mounted in its place. At that point, the original subvolume may also be deleted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An atomic <b>snapshot</b> {{object is}} {{an object that}} can be {{concurrently}} accessed by asynchronous processes prone to crash. It is made of m components (base atomic registers) and is defined by two operations: an update operation that allows a process to atomically assign a new value to a component and a <b>snapshot</b> operation that atomically reads and returns the values of all the components. To cope with {{the net effect of}} concurrency, asynchrony and failures, the algorithm implementing the update operation has to help concurrent <b>snapshot</b> operations in order they can always terminate. This paper is on partial <b>snapshot</b> objects. Such an object provides a <b>snapshot</b> operation that takes a (dynamically defined) subset of the components as input parameter, and atomically reads and returns the values of this subset of components. The paper has two contributions. The first is the introduction of two properties for partial <b>snapshot</b> object algorithms, called help-locality and uptodateness. Help-locality requires that an update operation helps only the concurrent partial <b>snapshot</b> operations that read the component it writes. When an update of a component r helps a partial <b>snapshot,</b> uptodateness requires that the update provides the partial <b>snapshot</b> with a value of the component r that is at least as recent as the value it writes into that component. (No <b>snapshot</b> algorithm proposed so far satisfies these properties.) The second contribution consists of an update and a partial <b>snapshot</b> algorithms that are wait-free, linearizable and satisfy the previou...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody <b>snapshots.</b> Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E

Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of copy-on-write is that, when ZFS writes new data, the blocks containing the old {{data can be}} retained, allowing a snapshot version of the file system to be maintained. ZFS <b>snapshots</b> are consistent (they reflect the entire data as it existed at a single point in time), and can be created extremely quickly, since all the data composing the snapshot is already stored, with the entire storage pool often snapshotted several times per hour. They are also space efficient, since any unchanged data is shared among the file system and its <b>snapshots.</b> <b>snapshots</b> are inherently read-only, ensuring {{they will not be}} modified after creation, although they should not be relied on as a sole means of backup. Entire <b>snapshots</b> can be restored and also files and directories within <b>snapshots.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although direct {{sequencing}} is {{the gold}} standard for KRAS mutation detection in routine diagnostics, it remains laborious, time consuming, and not very sensitive. Our objective was to evaluate <b>SNaPshot</b> and the KRAS StripAssay as alternatives to sequencing for KRAS mutation detection in daily practice. KRAS exon 2 –specific PCR followed by sequencing or by a <b>SNaPshot</b> reaction was performed. For the StripAssay, a mutant-enriched PCR was followed by hybridization to KRAS-specific probes bound to a nitrocellulose strip. To test sensitivities, dilution series of mutated DNA in wild-type DNA were made. Additionally, direct sequencing and <b>SNaPshot</b> were evaluated in 296 colon cancer samples. Detection limits of direct sequencing, <b>SNaPshot,</b> and StripAssay were 20 %, 10 %, and 1 % tumor cells, respectively. Direct sequencing and <b>SNaPshot</b> can detect all 12 mutations in KRAS codons 12 and 13, whereas the StripAssay detects 10 of the most frequent ones.
