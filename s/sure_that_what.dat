He stated [...] "the fans and us as creators are the two parents [...] and just like real parents, you’re not always going to agree on what is best for raising that child," [...] going on to say, [...] "we want to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we do pleases them but the initial reaction might not always be positive. We do listen to the fans but we can’t be beholden to them at every turn or I don’t think we’ll ever make progress in terms of the series’ development".|$|E

Today, it was a Muslim; tomorrow, unless the government's powers are taken away from them, it could be any number of categories of 'enemy combatants' who have not yet been identified." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Frozen {{plot was}} first {{introduced}} {{at the end of}} the third season of the series. The show's executive producers explained that Disney had not asked them to do a crossover for the original film. Rather, they fell in love with Frozen when it premiered in November, saw it three more times, then developed a story idea in February and successfully pitched it to ABC Studios, the ABC network, and then Disney brand management. The producers shared that [...] "their writers' room was [...] "basically a 'Frozen' appreciation room" [...] and they would be [...] "completely honored" [...] if the original movie stars wanted to reprise their roles. Producer Adam Horowitz said that they were not going to [...] "redo" [...] the film: [...] "We're very aware of what we think makes this character from 'Frozen' so special and we want to honor that and make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we do is in the universe of [...] everyone fell in love with this past year." ...|$|E

50|$|With {{high school}} behind him, Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) decides {{that as an}} adult, it's time to start living his life. Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) had hoped that his son would {{go to college and}} study law, but Andy isn't <b>sure</b> <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> he wants to do so he heads off to New York City to find a job. Too proud to accept {{financial}} help from his longtime friend Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), he at least lets her drive him to the city.|$|R

Investment in both directions, backed by well-enforced rules, is vital to {{creating}} growth and jobs here at home. For example, last year, the Kentucky-based company that owns KFC and Pizza Hut, two iconic American brands, actually made more money selling pizza and fried chicken in China than in the United States. But this creates jobs at headquarters in Louisville and it creates jobs as well in China. When Tom Friedman warns that the Chinese will “eat our lunch,” I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>what</b> he had in mind." ...|$|R
