The two storey {{building}} is constructed of brick in a classical style, dressed with ham stone features and a hipped tile roof. The garden frontage {{of the house is}} symmetrical with a pediment at the centre above a cupola. It includes a porched door with some semi-circular stone <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> garden. The entrance facade is asymmetrical, with a tall arcaded entrance projecting out from the house on the south-west corner.|$|E
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} support of action against communists and their associates began to abate somewhat after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached {{himself in the}} Army-McCarthy Hearings, producing a backlash. The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought {{a halt to the}} Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in Yates v. United States, , which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> forcible overthrow of the government, rather than merely advocating it in theory.|$|E
25|$|Fujinami quickly gained {{popularity}} {{and was the}} leading vote getter amongst Central League starting pitchers for the 2013 NPB All-Star Series, with more than 96,000 votes. Fujinami started the second game of the All-Star series and pitched two scoreless innings. In {{the top of the}} sixth inning, he played a prank on Nippon Ham's Sho Nakata, a former senior at Osaka Tōin, by throwing 2 very slow balls over his head, which prompted Nakata to throw his bat and jokingly take a few <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> mound. Fujinami ended up striking out Nakata.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1830s, liberal and radical boyars, {{many of whom}} studied in Western Europe, {{particularly}} in Paris, had taken the first <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> anti-slavery goal. During that period, Ion Câmpineanu, like the landowning brothers Nicolae and Ştefan Golescu, emancipated all his slave retinue, while boyar Emanoil Bălăceanu freed his slaves and organized for them the Scăieni Phalanstery, an utopian socialist community. In 1836, Wallachian Prince Alexandru II Ghica freed 4,000 domneşti slaves and had a group of landowners sign them up as paid workforce, while instigating a policy through which the state purchased privately owned slaves and set them free.|$|E
25|$|Augustus' {{religious}} reformations {{raised the}} funding and public {{profile of the}} Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to {{the cult of the}} deified Livia, wife of Augustus. They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus, he took <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> dissolution of the order. His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple.|$|E
25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in {{his rear}} at Mohrungen. He {{immediately}} called off the battle and retraced his <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> town. What had {{happened was that}} Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwały), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Count Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under General Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake Marąg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town.|$|E

News of the Russian military creating its own Linux distribution has also surfaced, and has come to fruition as the G.H.ost Project. The Indian state of Kerala has gone to the extent of mandating that all state high schools run Linux on their computers. China uses Linux exclusively as the operating system for its Loongson processor family to achieve technology independence. In Spain, some regions have developed their own Linux distributions, which are widely used in education and official institutions, like gnuLinEx in Extremadura and Guadalinex in Andalusia. France and Germany have also taken <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> adoption of Linux. North Korea's Red Star OS, developed since 2002, is based on a version of Fedora Linux.|$|E

500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E
2500|$|Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī (1412–1482) was {{the last}} major medieval Arab algebraist, who {{improved}} on the algebraic notation earlier used by Ibn al-Yāsamīn in the 12th century and, in the Maghreb, by Ibn al-Banna in the 13th century. In contrast to the syncopated notations of their predecessors, Diophantus and Brahmagupta, which lacked symbols for mathematical operations, al-Qalasadi's algebraic notation {{was the first to}} have symbols for these functions and was thus [...] "the first <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> introduction of algebraic symbolism."

The syncopated notations of his predecessors, however, lacked symbols for mathematical operations.

Brad Tuttle of Time predicted that paying $6 {{a month for}} a streaming app with much less content than Netflix would not be a popular idea with parents. Scott Porch of Wired wrote positively of Viacom's efforts to decrease their dependence on cable subscriptions with the app, but noticed that it was only [...] "baby <b>steps</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> no-cable-required model." [...] Amanda Bindel of Common Sense Media commended the user-friendly layout and educational content, but felt that it lacked sufficient parental controls.
