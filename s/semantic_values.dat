30|$|In {{the search}} for {{semantic}} expression models, language philosophies lend some inspiration to the PLN researchers through their semantic theories, where {{the goal is to}} understand the nature of the content of concepts. In general, a concept refers to the <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> expressed by a linguistic expression of a natural language, when used in a sentence. A concept can be named by simple terms that belong to the open classes of words—nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs (e.g., “crime”, “death”, “to reside”), or by expressions composed of more than one term, whether or not linked by closed classes of words—prepositions and conjunctions (e.g. “math test”, “street mugging”, “crime of passion”). In this work, we use the terms “concept”, “content of a concept” or “conceptual content“ to refer to the <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> of a linguistic expression that named a concept. For example, when we refer to the concept “politician”, named by the linguistic expression “politician”, we are refering to the semantic relations that define the <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> of this concept.|$|R

40|$|A common view {{relating}} {{compositional semantics}} and {{the objects of}} assertion holds the following: Sentences φ and ψ expresses the same proposition iff φ and ψ have the same modal profile. Following Dummett, Evans, and Lewis, Stanley argues that this view is fundamentally mistaken. According to Dummett, we must distinguish the semantic contribution a sentence makes to more complex expressions in which it occurs from its assertoric content. Stojnić insists that views which distinguish the roles of content and <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> must nevertheless ensure a tight connection between the two. But, she contends, there is a crucial disanalogy between the views that follow Lewis and the views that follow Dummett. Stanley’s Dummettian view is argued to contain a fatal flaw: On such views, {{there is no way}} to secure an appropriate connection between <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> and a theoretically motivated notion of assertoric content.

Its effectiveness is not only making the servers maintain just {{one or a few}} versions of the content, but also reducing the data size delivered to clients. As images have much larger size compared with texts and the transcoding of them can significantly reduce the totally delivered bytes, in this paper we mainly pay attention to the adaptive transcoding of Web images. Firstly, in order to quantify the information provided by Web images, we proposed the concept of “semantic value”. Secondly, the idea of image classification combined with user study is taken to assign the <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> to Web images. Then an adaptive model is designed based on a survey of the transcoding characters of Web images and the <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> assigning strategy. The model will optimally deliver the Web contents over heterogeneous networks by deciding proper transcoding way for each image so as to maintain as much <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> of transcoded Web document as possible.

Extensional logic cannot reach inside such fine logical structures of the language, it stops at a coarser level. The attempts for such deep logical analysis have a long past: authors as early as Aristotle had already studied modal syllogisms. Gottlob Frege developed a kind of two dimensional semantics: for resolving questions like those of intensional statements, he has introduced a distinction between two semantic values: sentences (and individual terms) have both an extension and an intension. These <b>semantic</b> <b>values</b> can be interpreted, transferred also for functors (except for intensional functors, they have only intension).|$|E

In classical logic, negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity and vice versa. In intuitionistic logic, according to the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation, the negation of a proposition p is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of p.|$|E
5000|$|Old Japanese is {{the oldest}} attested stage of the Japanese language. Through the spread of Buddhism, the Chinese writing system was {{imported}} to Japan. The earliest texts found in Japan are written in Classical Chinese, but {{they may have been}} meant to be read as Japanese by the kanbun method. Some of these Chinese texts show the influences of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, placing the verb after the object). In these hybrid texts, Chinese characters are also occasionally used phonetically to represent Japanese particles. The earliest text, the Kojiki, dates to the early 8th century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters. The end of Old Japanese coincides {{with the end of the}} Nara period in 794. Old Japanese uses the Man'yōgana system of writing, which uses kanji for their phonetic as well as <b>semantic</b> <b>values.</b> Based on the Man'yōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct syllables. Texts written with Man'yōgana use two different kanji for each of the syllables now pronounced [...] (The Kojiki has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo1 and mo2 apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of syllables shrank to 67 in Early Middle Japanese, though some were added through Chinese influence.|$|E

The ordinary <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> and focus <b>semantic</b> <b>value</b> of the focus domain are called “the focused denotation” and “the alternatives,” respectively. Besides, I assume that the alternatives include only members with different meanings from the focused denotation (e.g., {introduce Matt to Sue, introduce Tom to Sue} for the alternatives of 26 a). Based on this, the focus particle only asserts that the focused denotation (i.e., introducing Bill to Sue), but not alternatives (i.e., introducing Matt to Sue, introducing Tom to Sue), participates in the following semantic computation. This results in the meaning that the subject John possesses the focused denotation, namely introducing Bill to Sue, but not the alternatives.|$|R

40|$|Here is {{a simple}} and {{inviting}} picture: the <b>semantic</b> <b>values</b> of sentences, relative to contexts, are sets of possible worlds. These are the truth conditions of assertions of those sentences in contexts. They are thus the contents of assertions, or the objects of attitudes we might take towards such contents. There have been many questions raised about the simple picture. For instance, sets of worlds might well be too coarse-grained to capture fully the objects of attitudes, leading to more fine-grained or structured contents. But opting for structure does not conflict with truth conditions being sets of worlds, and so, I shall ignore this sort of question. I shall likewise ignore questions {{about the nature of}} possible worlds. I propose to ignore these questions to focus on whether the <b>semantic</b> <b>values</b> of sentences should be sets of something more than possible worlds.
