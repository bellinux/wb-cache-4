Rather than enumerate the behaviour (transfer function, attenuation function, delay function and so on) of a specific circuit, instead a requirement for the image impedance itself was developed. The image impedance can be {{expressed in terms of}} the open-circuit and <b>short-circuit</b> <b>impedances</b> of the filter as [...] Since the image impedance must be real in the passbands and imaginary in the stopbands according to image theory, there is a requirement that the poles and zeroes of Zo and Zs cancel in the passband and correspond in the stopband. The behaviour of the filter can be entirely defined in terms of the positions in the complex plane of these pairs of poles and zeroes. Any circuit which has the requisite poles and zeroes will also have the requisite response. Cauer pursued two related questions arising from this technique: what specification of poles and zeroes are realisable as passive filters; and what realisations are equivalent to each other. [...] The results of this work led Cauer to develop a new approach, now called network synthesis.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new three-limb three-phase electromagnetic transformer {{model in the}} Harmonic Domain. It is a composite model, with the linear circuit represented by the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>impedances,</b> and the non-linear magnetic circuit represented in a linearised form by means of Norton equivalents. The proposed Norton equivalents accurately represent the magnetic circuit, as they are derived from the linearisation (in the Harmonic Domain) of individual magnetising characteristics for the magnetic branches and the magnetic circuit laws. A Newton-Raphson iterative procedure is also developed to accurately determine the non-linear distribution of the magnetic fluxes. The influence of the magnetising characteristic approximation upon the harmonic solution is investigated. The adequacy of several approximations, including cubic splines, are assessed and Singular Value Decomposition have been explored to determine the equation parameters. The widely accepted assumption of equally distributing the magnetising currents between the primary and secondary terminals is also investigated. For single-phase transformer models this assumption is shown to be inaccurate, at harmonic frequencies, and inadequate, for star-connected three-phase transformer models and improved harmonic distribution factors for the magnetising currents are proposed.

5000|$|Leakage {{inductance}} {{can be an}} undesirable property, as {{it causes}} the voltage to change with loading. [...] In many cases it is useful. Leakage inductance has the useful effect of limiting the current flows in a transformer (and load) without itself dissipating power (excepting the usual non-ideal transformer losses). Transformers are generally designed to have a specific value of leakage inductance such that the leakage reactance created by this inductance is a specific value at the desired frequency of operation.Commercial transformers are usually designed with a <b>short-circuit</b> leakage reactance <b>impedance</b> of between 3% and 10%. If the load is resistive and the leakage reactance is small (<10%) the output voltage will not drop by more than 0.5% at full load, ignoring other resistances and losses. High leakage reactance transformers are used for some negative resistance applications, such as neon signs, where a voltage amplification (transformer action) is required as well as current limiting. In this case the leakage reactance is usually 100% of full load impedance, so even if the transformer is shorted out {{it will not be}} damaged. Without the leakage inductance, the negative resistance characteristic of these gas discharge lamps would cause them to conduct excessive current and be destroyed. Transformers with variable leakage inductance are used to control the current in arc welding sets. In these cases, the leakage inductance limits the current flow to the desired magnitude.|$|R

30|$|Using {{the same}} set of {{waveform}} data, the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location can be estimated. The Thevenin impedance, {{often referred to as the}} <b>short-circuit</b> <b>impedance,</b> plays an important role when calculating the currents during a balanced or an unbalanced fault [12]. System operators obtain the Thevenin impedance by performing a short-circuit analysis on the circuit model. However, to avoid any erroneous fault current calculations due to an inaccurate circuit model, it is a good practice to validate the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>impedance</b> from the circuit model with that calculated from the fault data. The Thevenin impedance is also required by the Eriksson, Novosel et al., and other fault-locating algorithms to track down the location of a fault [8, 13, 14]. Furthermore, the Thevenin impedance calculated at regular intervals during a long duration fault can provide insight into the state of the transmission network upstream from the fault. Authors in [15] have attempted to estimate the Thevenin impedance but have not provided the equations for the same. Authors in [15, 16] have also highlighted the importance and uses of estimating the Thevenin impedance. Hence, it is essential to estimate the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the monitoring location using any available fault data.|$|E
