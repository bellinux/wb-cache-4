2500|$|On 9 August 2008, then health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss {{began his}} {{campaign}} for changing Section 377 of the Indian penal code, which makes homosexuality an unnatural act and thus illegal. At the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City, he said, [...] "Section 377 of IPC, which criminalises {{men who have sex}} with men, must go." [...] His ministerial portfolio had put him at odds with the Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil and several other ministers in seeking to <b>scrap</b> <b>Section</b> 377. In late 2008, he changed his argument saying he does not want the scrapping of Section 377 but a mere modification of the law treating homosexuality as a criminal offence punishable up to life imprisonment. He said he wants Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to resolve the matter, while he wanted to avoid discord with the home ministry, who said the altered law would then result in an increase in criminal incidences of sodomy or offences involving sexual abuse of children, particularly boys. In doing so he alleged that the law even penalises health workers who treat homosexuals, while making this a cognizable and non-bailable offence.|$|E
5000|$|At an April 2008 conference, the Iona Institute {{highlighted}} a posited {{move by the}} European Union, {{which would}} require Ireland to <b>scrap</b> <b>Section</b> 37 of the Employment Equality Act 2000. Section 37 allows government-funded religious schools and hospitals to discriminate against any employee on any basis except gender if having the employee is [...] "undermining the religious ethos" [...] of the institution. David Quinn, {{the director of the}} institute, said that removing the discrimination exemption [...] "could impact very severely on the freedom of action of faith-based schools". This section has been opposed by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation since its introduction.|$|E

50|$|In the Scottish Parliament, {{the repeal}} process was more successful. The Equality Network led the {{campaign}} in favour of <b>scrapping</b> <b>Section</b> 28, while various groups campaigned against the repeal. The Scottish millionaire businessman Brian Souter privately funded a postal ballot {{as part of his}} Keep the Clause campaign, which returned an apparent 86% support for keeping the clause, from a response from slightly less than one third of the 3.9 million registered Scottish voters. Despite this, Section 28 was repealed by MSPs as part of the Ethical Standards in Public Life Act on 21 June 2000 with a 99 to 17 majority vote with only two abstentions.|$|R

And this law should have been scrapped the day the Britishers left India. So hopefully, the 2009 verdict of the Delhi Court, that decriminalized gay sex among consenting adults, will be back soon.” Delhi-based fashion designer, who married his partner Rahul Arora stated, “I am hopeful and positive that the five-judge constitution bench will <b>scrap</b> <b>section</b> 377 and make this country a better place for us to live”. National Award-winning filmmaker Apurva Asrani, who wrote the film Aligarh, when referring to the five-judge constitutional bench stated, “the Supreme Court has allowed itself a chance to redeem itself from a blemish on its otherwise spotless image.” “This (homosexuality) has been accepted even in our Hindu scriptures. I stand by my gay friends” said Actor Raveena Tandon. “Today’s decision is a great step. However, I think a disparity that can easily be addressed by amending the Indian Penal Code shouldn’t have to be a 15-year-long struggle” said actor and gay rights activist Celina Jaitley.|$|E

50|$|In 1859 in {{preparation}} for restoring the cathedral, {{it was decided that}} the walls were so unstable that the church would need to be dismantled and be rebuilt. The designer, Julius Tholle, wanted to keep as much of the medieval building as was feasible and incorporate it into the new building. In 1863 the process of tearing the church down was completed and the cornerstone for the new cathedral was laid. Tholle died in 1871 and his plan was <b>scrapped.</b> The older <b>sections</b> which were deemed too unsalvageable were torn down.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a method whereby {{the distribution of}} fatigue damage along riser tensioner ropes is calculated, taking account of heave motion, set tension, system geometry, tidal range and rope specification. From these data the distribution of damage along the rope is calculated for a given time period using a Miner’s summation method. This information can then {{be used to help}} the operator decide on the length of rope to ‘slip and cut’ whereby a length {{from the end of the}} rope is removed and the rope moved through the system from a storage drum such that sections of rope that have already suffered significant fatigue damage are not moved to positions where there is another peak in the distribution. There are two main advantages to be gained by using the fatigue damage model. The first is that it shows the amount of fatigue damage accumulating at different points along the rope, enabling the most highly damaged section to be removed well before failure. The second is that it makes for greater efficiency, as damage can be spread more evenly along the rope over time, avoiding the need to <b>scrap</b> long <b>sections</b> of undamaged rope...|$|R

40|$|This was {{the first}} piece that I wrote for George W. Welch, a group {{initially}} formed at Goldsmiths out of postgrad and undergrad students, and which, like several other young ‘postminimal’ new music groups of the early 80 s, played its own repertoire of players’ pieces and arrangements. All of my compositions for GWW were named after underground stations, commencing on the (old) Jubilee line (northbound), with Charing X, Green Park, and Bond Street, followed by a deviation to Hobbs End (fictitious tube station of Nigel Kneale’s Quatermass and the Pit), British Museum (obsolete), Columbus Circle (in New York), and finally Monument. If you’re stuck for a name for a piece then underground stations offer a lot of possibilities. Like {{a lot of my}} music the material of this piece evolves out of very small musical seeds - a single piano chord that crunches out {{at the beginning of the}} faster outer sections, and a quietly pulsing piano chord that sets the scene for the central slow <b>section.</b> <b>Scraps</b> of 80 s pop surface - sample-like repeats of small phrases, unsubtle backbeats, abrupt edits from one section to another; also recollections of TV music from my childhood, particularly Edwin Astley and his exciting incidental music for The Saint; and a chachacha cadence straight out of weekend TV light entertainment programmes. The slow motion music in the middle of the piece without a doubt stems from my childhood fascination with listening to long playing 33 1 / 3 records turned down to half-speed (and an octave lower) on the turntable, at 16 2 / 3 RPM. Twenty eight years later this might all sound like rather arch postmodernist whimsy, but the 24 year old composer of this piece was seeking to discover a style that might acknowledge the lineage of his actual listening experience - lowbrow, middlebrow, highbrow - and, filtered through GWW’s slightly awkward instrumentation, to find an alternative narrative tone and voice to the abstract expressionist earnestness he heard in many currents of new music at the time...|$|R
