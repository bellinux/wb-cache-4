40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with exploring the equity market price discovery process, the translation and incorporation of new information into stock prices, by studying both what information is included in this process and which valuation methods are used to translate that information into a value. The overarching research question posed in this thesis is: How is equity valued? The overarching question is broad and has been divided into the following sub questions: What valuation methods do companies use when valuing takeover targets? What valuation methods do <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> use when valuing equity? What factors explain the variation {{in the use of}} valuation methods by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts?</b> To what extent do <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> utilize non-financial information in their reports? These questions are addressed in four separate essays. Findings of the thesis emphasized that valuation behavior is contextual to several specific circumstances. Findings showed that companies valuing takeover targets used sophisticated valuation methods to a higher extent than did <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> Findings also showed systematic differences in the choice of valuation methods among <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> With regards to the use of non-financial information and information on Intellectual Capital this thesis showed that the context of the target firm dictates which information is relevant for predicting future performance, and hence is used by analysts. Additionally, the accessibility of information is an important factor affecting what information is used in the valuation process. Understanding the valuation behavior of the different actors on the capital market is to understand the pricing process of the market, and as such the contribution of this thesis has been to shed more light on the cornerstone of market efficiency- the ability of market actors to identify and buy (sell) under priced (over priced) stocks...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Structural {{economic}} changes in many countries, together with unprecedented {{developments in the}} business environment, have significantly affected the value creation processes of firms and the way business is conducted. The traditional financial reporting model is inadequate {{as a consequence of}} these developments, and intellectual capital (IC) information has gained importance for investment decision making. Empirical capital markets research demonstrates the value-relevance and predictive ability of certain types of IC information. The use of IC information by capital market participants is a topic that has begun to gain attention from contemporary researchers, but for which scant empirical evidence exists. Much of the research in this area relies on the literature about the use of non-financial information (NFI), which is inadequate in its examination of certain types of IC information. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis is to examine the use and communication of IC information by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> <b>Sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> are of particular interest because they are capital market intermediaries and sophisticated processors of corporate information. The reports they produce provide an opportunity to examine their use and communication of IC information. The specific objectives of this thesis are to examine: the extent and types of IC information used by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> in initiating coverage reports produced by them; how IC information is used and communicated in these reports; and factors that may influence the use of IC information by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> In order to address these research objectives a content analysis of IC references in 64 initiating coverage reports written on an equivalent number of S&P/ASX 200 / 300 companies is performed. The content analysis identifies and measures IC references by topic, evidence (discursive, monetary, numerical, or visual), news-tenor (positive, neutral or negative) and time orientation (forward-looking, past-oriented or non-time-specific). The findings indicate that Australian <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> appreciate the importance of IC in firm valuation, and thus are not ambivalent about the use of IC information in general. However, the findings suggest that their communication of IC information is inconsistent and unsystematic, and inadequate in relation to certain types of IC. This highlights the need for undertaking work at a policy level to educate and train <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> to deal with IC information, and the development of better models and guidelines for analysing and communicating IC information. On how IC information is used, this thesis finds that <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> have varying uses of IC information. It was found that IC is predominantly communicated discursively, positively, and in a past-oriented manner; and in doing so IC is used as a tool to further the sell-side analysts’ agenda for the company analysed. Further, the results highlight that the type of investment recommendation in analyst reports impacts on the evidence, news tenor, and time-orientation of IC communicated. These findings alert future researchers to the wider role played by IC beyond its use in forecasts and valuations. Also, the findings indicate inter-sectoral differences in the use of IC information in analyst reports, highlighting the need to improve IC reporting practices of firms by including additional information on industry-specific IC value drivers. Further, it was found that <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> emphasise IC information in analyst reports for companies from high IC-intensive sectors compared to those from low IC-intensive sectors. Similarly, it was found that analyst reports on risky companies contain significantly more IC information than analyst reports on less risky companies. Contrary to expectations, the extent of IC information is not found to vary with firm size and firm profitability. Also, the results support that the extent of certain types of IC information differs between types of analysts’ investment recommendations. More generally, the findings of this thesis suggest that the corporate reporting process could be improved by including additional types of IC information and providing this information more effectively in a manner that enables users to visualise the interrelationships between resources (both tangible and intangible) and outcomes. This study calls for standards or guidelines for intellectual capital reporting (ICR) in Australia and the expansion of the role of auditing and assurance services to enhance reliability of firm provided IC information in a bid to improve the use of IC information in company analysis by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} whether {{a high level of}} voluntary disclosure attracts <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> In other words, the authors check whether the number of analysts following a given firm increases with the extent of voluntary information that corporate managers provide in annual reports. Design/methodology/approach – The paper relies on regression analyses to study the relationship between the level of coverage by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> and the extent of voluntary disclosure for a sample of 155 non-financial firms listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange and members of the SBF 250 index. Findings – The empirical results show that the number of analysts following a given firm increases with the extent of voluntary disclosure. Consequently, the authors conclude that analysts are interested in the volume of information provided voluntarily by corporate managers. Their interest varies across the voluntary-information categories (strategic, financial, non-financial and governance) disclosed in annual reports. Originality/value – This study extends previous research by investigating sell-side analysts’ preferences in terms of voluntary-information categories in annual reports. A better understanding of the effects of sub-categories of voluntary information is useful to corporate managers wishing to meet market expectations and attract <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> In fact, the authors verify how each category of disclosed information (strategic, financial, non-financial and governance) affects the analyst coverage intensity.

Further, in the year after becoming stars, the recommendations of WSJ stars are significantly worse than those of nonstars; and the recommendations and earnings forecasts of I/I stars, as well as the earnings forecasts of WSJ stars, are not significantly different from those of nonstars.

40|$|This paper explores whether {{firm-specific}} information events drive economically relevant {{positive and}} negative stock price changes and trading volume and, if so, the nature of such information. We find that no less than 65 % of significant price changes and trading volume movements in our sample of FTSE 350 companies can be readily explained by public domain information contradicting the thesis that corporate news is not a primary driver, and that share price changes and trading volume activity are driven by factors unrelated to information flows per se. In addition, we find that a parsimonious set of news categories represent the key drivers. <b>Sell-side</b> <b>analyst</b> stock recommendations and earnings forecast revisions as a class, unaccompanied by other news releases, dominate all other news categories in terms of significant market reaction. However, {{taking into account the}} "relative" magnitude of market response to different news releases, firms' formal accounting disclosures dominate within this domain. As such, we conclude these are not fully anticipated by apparently more timely market disclosures, and that the existence of news services and the activities of the <b>sell-side</b> <b>analyst</b> are not substitutes for a firm's interim and preliminary results.

Hence, analysts with good early performance benefit later from sticking to the consensus (herding), while analysts with poor early performance can only escape their low standing by taking risk and deviating from the consensus (anti-herding).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a methodology that enables the generation of valid and reliable inferences on what and how intellectual capital (IC) information is communicated by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> in their research reports. Design/methodology/approach: The method described in this paper involves content-analysing initiating coverage analyst reports using a four-dimensional IC coding framework and a detailed coding instrument, which is founded in the literature and indigenous to analyst reports. The paper explicates methodological decisions associated with content analysis: selecting the appropriate sampling unit; recording unit and measurement unit; developing the categorisation scheme and coding instrument; the need for test coding; the approach to data collection; and assessment of reliability and validity. Findings: The methodology described is applied to a sample of analyst reports to illustrate inferences that can be drawn on what and how IC information is communicated in analyst reports. Practical implications: Various practical issues arising in the application of content analysis method are discussed and a methodology for investigating IC communications by <b>sell-side</b> <b>analysts</b> is described in this paper. This knowledge can be useful to future researchers conducting content-analytic studies involving analyst reports in general, and IC communications in analyst reports in particular.
