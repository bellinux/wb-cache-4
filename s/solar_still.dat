25|$|Charles Greeley Abbot (May 31, 1872 – December 17, 1973) was an American {{astrophysicist}} and {{the fifth}} secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, serving from 1928 until 1944.

25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} evaporative cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, {{and that can be}} done economically with a low temperature <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>solar</b> {{distillation}} <b>stills</b> that have been devised for converting available brackish or waste water into potable water. The horizontal basin-type still is one of these. And because of its low productivity, it is not commonly used. On the other hand, tilted <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> heat up more rapidly, operate at higher mean temperatures, have lower thermal capacity, and produce somewhat more potable water. There are also other types of <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> that have been evolved, such as multistage flash distillation <b>stills</b> and <b>solar</b> concentrator <b>stills.</b> Previous work on <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> by researchers in the open literature {{is divided into two}} sections: experimental and numerical as described hereafter.|$|R

2500|$|A new {{approach}} that {{works like a}} <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> but {{on the scale of}} industrial evaporation ponds is the integrated biotectural system. It can be considered [...] "full desalination" [...] because it converts the entire amount of saltwater intake into distilled water. One of the advantages of this system is the feasibility for inland operation. Standard advantages also include no air pollution and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge. Another important advantage is the production of sea salt for industrial and other uses. As of 2015, 50% of the world's sea salt production relies on fossil energy sources.|$|E
50|$|A {{concentrated}} <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is {{a system}} that uses the same quantity of solar heat input (same solar collection area) as a simple <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> but can produce a volume of freshwater that is many times greater. While a simple <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is a way of distilling water by using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from a water source and ambient air to cool a condenser film, a concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> uses a concentrated solar thermal collector to concentrate solar heat and deliver it to a multi-effect evaporation process for distillation, thus increasing the natural rate of evaporation. The concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is capable of large-scale water production in areas with plentiful solar energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentrated}} <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> {{can produce}} {{as much as}} 20x more water than the theoretical maximum of a standard <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> and in practice, can produce as much as 30x the volume. For instance, with a solar collection area of 10 acres, a standard <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> operating at a typical 25% efficiency may produce as much as 27.8acre-ft/yr in a region with an average daily solar irradiation value of 21.6MJ/m². A concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> can produce more than 750acre-ft/yr in the same region with the same collection area.|$|E

There are many types of <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> {{including}} large scale concentrated solar stills, and condensation traps (better known as moisture traps amongst survivalists).

50|$|One type {{of solar}} {{desalination}} unit is a <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> {{it is also}} similar to a condensation trap. A <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is a simple way of distilling water, using {{the heat of the}} Sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills. In a <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.|$|E
30|$|Saline {{water in}} still is heated by solar radiation. The water vapor formed is {{condensed}} at the inner glass surface, {{and the water}} droplets are glided along the glass. The condensed water is collected in a calibrated flask. The depth of the saline water in the <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> is maintained constant manually using the feed water tank and control valves. The present experimental study aims to study the effect of still surface area variation on fresh water productivity and the efficiency of single-slope basin <b>solar</b> <b>stills.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} method of the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> {{is called the}} transpiration bag. [...] The bag is a simple plastic bag and it folds over a stemmed plant with a corner pointing down to allow the condensate to pool. From there a person can remove the water by taking the bag off and pouring the water out or one can make a tiny incision into the corner to drip water into a cup. Its advantage over the basin type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> mentioned before is that it only requires a bag like one can get at the grocery store. It doesn’t need to be completely transparent. A disadvantage of the transpiration bag is the requirement for a plant in direct sunlight or heat to take the condensate.|$|E

50|$|The “wick” type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is a glass-topped box {{constructed}} and held at angle to allow sunlight in. Salt water poured {{in from the}} top is heated by sunlight, evaporating the water. It condenses {{on the underside of}} the glass and drips to the bottom. A pool of brine in the still attached to the wicks which separates the water into banks to increase surface area for heating. The distilled water comes out of the bottom and depending on the quality of construction most of the salt has been purged from the water. The more wicks, the more heat can be transferred to the salt water and more product can be made. A plastic net can also catch salt water before it falls into the container and give it more time to heat up and separate into brine and water. The wick type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is made vapor tight, as in the vapor does not escape to the atmosphere. To aid in absorbing more heat, some wicks are blackened to take in more heat. Glass’s absorption of heat is negligible compared to plastic at higher temperatures. A problem, depending on application, with glass is that it is not flexible if the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is not a standard shape.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concentrated}} <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> implements {{a method}} for recovering the latent heat of the distillate vapor not captured and reused by a standard <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> This is done by using multiple stages of evaporation in series (see multiple-effect evaporator). The latent heat of the distillate vapor produced in the n-1 stage (or effect) is recovered in the nth stage by boiling the leftover concentrated brine from the n-1 stage which produces distillate vapor whose latent heat will be recovered in the n+1 stage by boiling the leftover concentrated brine from the nth stage. [...] Since brine is continuously concentrated in each stage, its boiling point will continue to rise under standard conditions. To overcome the boiling point elevation of the brine, each evaporator stage operates at a lower pressure than the previous stage, which effectively reduces the boiling point, allowing for sufficient heat transfer {{to take place in}} each stage. This process can be repeated until the distillate conditions are sufficiently degraded (i.e., pressure and temperature are very low and the distillate vapor volume is very large).|$|E
