Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E

He takes [...] "when you lie down" [...] (ובשכבך) to mean the Shema is recited at the time that people lie down to go to sleep, and anyone who will be going to sleep for the night has done so by the end of the first watch. The sages say it can be recited until midnight. And Rabban Gamliel says until the light of dawn. Rabban Gamliel says that {{whatever}} mitzvahs the sages said can be performed only until midnight can actually be performed until the light of dawn. The sages said until midnight to distance a person from procrastination and thus transgression. (...) ...|$|E

6000|$|My Lords, you {{see what}} this man says himself, when endeavoring to prove his own innocence. Instead of proving it by the facts alleged by his counsel, he {{declares}} that by preserving good faith you might have conquered India, the most glorious conquest that was ever made in the world; that all the people want our assistance, but dread our connection. Why? Because our whole conduct has been one perpetual tissue of perfidy and breach of faith with every {{person who has been}} in alliance with us, in any mode whatever. Here is the man himself who <b>says</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Can</b> we bear that this man should now stand up in this place as the assertor of the honor of the British nation against us, who charge this dishonor to have fallen upon us by him, through him, and during his government? ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{with respect}} to immortality. As {{physical}} science states this problem, it seems to stand thus: [...] "Is there any means of knowing whether the series of states of consciousness, which has been causally associated for threescore years and ten with the arrangement and movements of innumerable millions of successively different material molecules, can be continued, in like association, with some substance which has not the properties of matter and force?" [...] As Kant said, on a like occasion, if anybody can answer that question, he is just the man I want to see. If he says that consciousness cannot exist, except in relation {{of cause and effect}} with certain organic {231} molecules, I must ask how he knows that; and if he <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>can,</b> I must put the same question. And I am afraid that, like jesting Pilate, I shall not think it worth while (having but little time before me) to wait for an answer.|$|E

60|$|Order, Homoptera.—Every {{one who has}} {{wandered in}} a {{tropical}} forest must have been astonished at the din made by the male Cicadæ. The females are mute; as the Grecian poet Xenarchus says, “Happy the Cicadas live, since they all have voiceless wives.” The noise thus made could be plainly heard on board the “Beagle,” when anchored at {{a quarter of a}} mile from the shore of Brazil; and Captain Hancock <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be heard at the distance of a mile. The Greeks formerly kept, and the Chinese now keep, these insects in cages for the sake of their song, so that it must be pleasing to the ears of some men.[448] The Cicadidæ usually sing during the day; whilst the Fulgoridæ appear to be night-songsters. The sound, according to Landois,[449] who has recently studied the subject, is produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles, which are set into motion by a current of air emitted from the tracheæ. It is increased by a wonderfully complex resounding apparatus, consisting of two cavities covered by scales. Hence the sound may truly be called a voice. In the female the musical apparatus is present, but very much less developed than in the male, and is never used for producing sound.|$|E
