Here we show that these Shockley <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> can be reinterpreted as topologically derived <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> (TDSSs) of a topological insulator (TI), a recently discovered quantum state. Based on band structure calculations, the Z 2 -type invariants of gold can be well-defined to characterize a TI. Further, our ARPES measurement validates TDSSs by detecting the dispersion of unoccupied <b>surface</b> <b>states.</b> The same TDSSs are also recognized on surfaces of other well-known noble metals (for example, silver, copper, platinum and palladium), which shines a new light on these long-known <b>surface</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the electromodulated {{infrared}} absorption of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> at the n-Si/acetonitrile electrolyte inter-face and discuss the results {{in connection with the}} standard theory of Harrick. Gold-atom-induced <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> and oxidation-induced <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> have been separately investigated. The optical absorption of gold-atom-induced <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> is well accounted for in the framework of Harrick's theory by using for the optical cross sections of the <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> a model derived from Lucovsky's treatment of absorption by deep impurities in semiconductors. However, it appears that the optical absorption of oxidation-induced <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> can be understood only by taking into account atomic reorgani-zation effects upon filling or emptying the <b>surface</b> <b>states.</b> The recent interest in photoelectrochemistry of semi-conductor electrodes has stimulated the development of fundamental studies on semiconductor/electrolyte inter-faces (1).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of strong {{correlations}} on the <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> of a three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator. An important observation is that correlations are strongly increased at the surface, which leads to an energetical confinement of the surface $f$-electrons into a narrow window around the Fermi energy at low enough temperature. This correlation effect {{in combination with the}} nontrivial topology has two remarkable consequences: (i) coexistence of light and heavy <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> at low temperatures. While heavy <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are formed directly in the surface layer, light <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are formed in the next-nearest surface layer. Furthermore, (ii) with increasing the temperature, the heavy <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> become incoherent and only light <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> can be observed. The coexistence of light and heavy <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> is thereby a remarkable characteristic of the combination of strong correlations and nontrivial topology.

50|$|In systems {{where more}} than one process gives a {{substantial}} kinetic response, {{it is necessary to}} adopt Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy that resolves the different capacitances in the system. For example {{in the presence of a}} <b>surface</b> <b>state</b> at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, the spectra show two arcs, one at low frequency and another one at high frequency. The depletion capacitance leading to Mott-Schottky plot is situated in the high frequency arc, as the depletion capacitance is a dielectric capacitance. On the other hand the low frequency feature corresponds to the chemical capacitance of the surface states. The <b>surface</b> <b>state</b> charging produces a plateau as indicated in Fig. 1d.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} efforts in realizing topological metallic phases with nontrivial <b>surface</b> <b>states.</b> It was suggested that orthorhombic perovskite iridates {{are classified as}} a topological crystalline metal (TCM) with flat <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> protected by lattice symmetries. Here we perform first-principles electronic structure calculations for epitaxially stabilized orthorhombic perovskite iridates. Remarkably, {{two different types of}} topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are found depending on surface directions. On side <b>surfaces,</b> flat <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> protected by lattice symmetries emerge, manifesting the topological crystalline character. On the top surface, on the other hand, an unexpected Dirac cone appears, indicating <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> protected by a time-reversal symmetry, which is confirmed by the presence of a nontrivial topological Z_ 2 index. These results suggest that the orthorhombic iridates are unique systems exhibiting both lattice- and global-symmetry-protected topological phases and <b>surface</b> <b>states.</b> Transitions to weak and strong topological insulators and implications of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> in light of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy are also discussed.

In a kind of infinite bichromatic superlattices satisfying some specific conditions, we obtain a finite portion of their in-gap states, which are superpositions of finite numbers of their unstable Bloch waves. By using these unstable in-gap states, we construct exactly several stable <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> near various interfaces in photonic superlattices. We analytically explore the parametric dependence of these exact <b>surface</b> <b>states.</b> Our analysis provides an exact demonstration {{for the existence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> and would be also helpful to understand <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> in other lattice systems.

This is in a sharp contrast to all previous studies, where <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> in linear or nonlinear lattices, such as Tamm or Shockley type <b>surface</b> <b>states,</b> are always associated with the presence of a certain type of structural or induced surface defect.

Previous experiments have demonstrated that topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> do not backscatter between equal and opposite momentum states, owing to their chiral spin texture. However, so far {{there is no evidence that}} these states in fact transmit through naturally occurring surface defects. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the transmission and reflection probabilities of topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> of antimony through naturally occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces. In contrast to nontopological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> of common metals (copper, silver and gold), which are either reflected or absorbed by atomic steps, we show that topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> of antimony penetrate such barriers with high probability.

40|$|Hematite (alpha-Fe 2 O 3) is an {{extensively}} investigated semiconductor for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The {{nature and}} role of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain however elusive.

The density of states for two relevant hematite terminations was calculated, and {{in both cases the}} presence and the role of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> was rationalized. Calculations also predicted a Nerstian dependence on the OER onset potential on pH, which was to a very good extent confirmed by PEC measurements on hematite model photoanodes. Impedance spectroscopy characterization confirmed that the OER takes place via the same <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> irrespective of pH.

40|$|Topological {{crystalline}} insulators (TCI) are new topological {{phases of}} matter protected by crystal symmetry of solids. Recently, the first realization of TCI has been predicted and observed in IV-VI semiconductor SnTe and related alloys Pb_ 1 -xSn_x(Te, Se). By combining k. p theory and band structure calculation, {{we present a}} unified approach to study topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> on various crystal surfaces of TCI in IV-VI semiconductors. We explicitly derive k. p Hamiltonian for topological <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> from electronic structure of the bulk, thereby providing a microscopic understanding of bulk-boundary correspondence in TCI. Depending on the surface orientation, we find two types of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> with qualitatively different properties. In particular, we predict that (111) <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> consist of four Dirac cones centered at time-reversal-invariant momenta Γ and M, while (110) <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> consist of Dirac cones at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta, similar to (001). Moreover, both (001) and (110) <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> exhibit a Lifshitz transition {{as a function of}} Fermi energy, which is accompanied by a Van-Hove singularity in density of states arising from saddle points in the band structure.

(a) Shows {{an energy}} diagram of n-type {{semiconductor}} {{in contact with}} redox electrolyte at the left side (yellow), and with a metallic ohmic contact at the right side. Ec [...] is the conduction band edge energy, Ev is the valence band energy of the semiconductor. By equilibration of the Fermi level in the semiconductor, EF, and the redox energy of electrolyte, Eredox, a Schottky barrier is formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The vertical size of the barrier in the energy diagram corresponds to the built-in potential Vbi. In the spatial axis the equilibration of Fermi levels produces a space charge region or depletion region of size w. A positive voltage applied to the back contact in (b) raises the Fermi level of electrons EFn, and decreases {{the size of the}} depletion region. Consequently the capacitance of the junction increases, and the reciprocal square capacitance decreases forming a linear Mott-Schottky plot in (c).

50|$|All {{materials}} {{can be classified}} by a single number, a topological invariant; this is constructed out of the bulk electronic wave functions, which are integrated in over the Brillouin zone, {{in a similar way}} that the genus is calculated in geometric topology. In certain materials the topological invariant can be changed when certain bulk energy bands invert due to strong spin-orbital coupling. At the interface between an insulator with non-trivial topology, a so-called topological insulator, and one with a trivial topology, the interface must become metallic. More over, the <b>surface</b> <b>state</b> must have linear Dirac like dispersion with a crossing point which is protected by time reversal symmetry.

He ordered Brattain and Bardeen {{to find out why}} it wouldn't. During November and December the two men carried out a variety of experiments, attempting to determine why Shockley's device wouldn't amplify. Bardeen was a brilliant theorist; Brattain, equally importantly, [...] "had an intuitive feel for what you could do in semiconductors". Bardeen theorized that the failure to conduct might be the result of local variations in the <b>surface</b> <b>state</b> which trapped the charge carriers. Brattain and Bardeen eventually managed to create a small level of amplification by pushing a gold metal point into the silicon, and surrounding it with distilled water.

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, {{there has been a}} wealth of studies to clarify the role of thin layers of electrocatalysts on {{semiconducting}} photoelectrodes to the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has been shown that the addition of a thin oxide overlayer in many cases cathodically shifts the potential of photocurrent onset and/or increases the maximum photocurrent, leading to greater collection efficiencies beneficial for OER. However, the origin of this enhancement is not well understood. Here, we present a model relying on analytical expressions rather than differential equations to investigate the role of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> in electrocatalyst-modified semiconductor photoelectrodes. Without catalyst overlayer, we find that if <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are screened, meaning charged <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are electronically neutralized via nearby solution ions, no Helmholtz potential is generated and photoelectrodes exhibit good performance. In contrast, if the <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> are unscreened, an additional Helmholtz potential forms decreasing the amount of band bending and resulting in poor performance. In the presence of a catalyst overlayer, there is a strong dependence on how the <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> interact with the catalyst. Catalysts in series with <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> can increase the effective rate of transfer from <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> to solution, leading to an increase in total current while catalysts that act in parallel with <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> can increase the open circuit voltage or photovoltage. Both series and parallel catalyst effects operate in tandem in real devices, leading to an increase in current and/or photovoltage, depending on the relevant exchange currents. This model does not only help to understand the role of <b>surface</b> <b>states</b> in charge transfer and ultimately efficiencies in photoelectrochemical systems but also allows facile application for other researchers.

Bulk energy bands that are being cut by these rods allow states that penetrate deep into the crystal.One therefore generally distinguishes between true surface states and surface resonances. True surface states are characterized by energy bands that are not degenerate with bulk energy bands. These state are existing in the forbidden energy gap only and are therefore localized at the surface, similar to the picture given in figure 3. At energies where a surface and a bulk state are degenerate, the surface and the bulk state can mix, forming a surface resonance. Such state can propagate deep into the bulk similar to Bloch waves, while retaining an enhanced amplitude close to the surface.|$|E

Sachdev's theories for the evolutionof the competing order with magnetic field, density, and temperature have been successfully compared with experiments. Sachdev and collaborators proposed a sign-problem free Monte Carlo method for studying the onset of antiferromagnetic order inmetals: this yields a phase diagram with high temperature superconductivity similar to that found in many materials, and has led to much subsequent work describing the origin of high temperature superconductivity in realistic models of various materials.Nematic order was predicted for the iron-based superconductors, anda new type of charge density wave, a d-form factor density wave, was predicted forthe hole-doped cuprates; both have been observed in numerous experiments.The pseudogap metal of the hole-doped cuprateswas argued to be a metal with topological order, as discussed above, based partly on its natural connection to the d-form factor density wave.
