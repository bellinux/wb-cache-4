Here, we demonstrate tapered nano-waveguides structured directly onto the diamond substrate hosting shallow-implanted nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers.

Three feature points are localized: the nose tip and the inner corners of {{the right and left}} eye. The points are found directly in the 3 D mesh, allowing a previous normalization before the depth map calculation. This method is applied after a preprocess stage where the candidate points are selected measuring curvatures on the surface and applying clustering techniques. The system is tested on a 3 D Face Database called FRAV 3 D with 105 people and a widely variety of acquisition conditions in order to test the method in a non-controlled environment. The success location rate is 99. 5 % {{in the case of the}} nose tip and 98 % in the case of eyes, in frontal conditions. This rate is similar even if the conditions change allowing small rotations.

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor <b>spun</b> yarn <b>quality</b> in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the feed roller and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the feed roller is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage.

Our experience building bridges for these communities has inspired several innovations {{with respect to the}} design, development and measurement of IP communications systems. The main contribution is the Open User Interconnect (OUI) stack, a communications system model that explicitly includes the user in relation to the underlying network. The OUI stack is orthogonal to the Open System Interconnect stack. There are two outcomes from including the user in the model. First, the OUI approach necessitates the adoption of usercentred methods such as Participatory Design {{and in the case of}} the South African Digital Divide, the adoption of Action Research principles. The second outcome is a user-centred measurement notion, called Quality of Communication (QoC), that is a macro-scale <b>spin</b> on <b>Quality</b> of Service.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} force controller to maintain desired normal forces during a very stiff contact operation conducted in a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. Force controller approach described in this thesis requires the accurate knowledge of the nominal tool path a priori. Obtaining the nominal tool path accurately is carried out by a vision based profile tracking system presented in this thesis. Both the force control and visual profile tracking systems require {{the development of an}} active control system to respond to force and vision signals. To facilitate the active control, a two-stage approach has been taken. The first stage is to bring the CNC machine under real-time control of an external computer. The second stage is the design of the active axis controller. This is achieved by adding sensor feedback loops to the external axis controller. The purpose of the active vision based profile tracking system is to automatically generate the tool path accurately. Emphasis is on combining low resolution vision with visual control of the precision CNC machine to attain the accuracy required for metal spinning. Combination of visual profile tracking and an edge detection method that gives sub-pixel accuracy were used to obtain the required tool path. A curvature detection algorithm was developed to identify segments of the tool path by assuming that the tool path consists of circular and straight line segments. The developed active force controller operates in a dynamic setup and is used to maintain tool forces at desired levels. The complete control system operates {{in a manner similar to}} reaction compensation and the force controller can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller with minimum integral wind-up effect. As a result, a direct dependency of the control efforts on error signals has been eliminated. In addition, the force controller brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system.

The Tribest resin has processing characteristics similar tovinylesters: being initiated with peroxide.

For all his on-pitch and off-pitch controversies, Warne's place in cricketing posterity has been assured {{by the fact that}} he has overturned the domination of cricket by fast bowling that had prevailed for two decades before his debut. Despite the presence of high <b>quality</b> <b>spin</b> bowlers such as the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s or Abdul Qadir on the Test scene, Australia's fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had dominated cricket in the early 1970s.

In the early 1990s, with the West Indies on the wane, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan were assuming the mantle of the world's most feared bowling combination. It was in that context that Warne's tormenting of batsmen became so significant rather than his actual statistics. His humiliation of Mike Gatting and subsequent dominance, in particular, of English and South African batsmen, provided a welcome sight for cricket watchers weary of the relentless intimidation by West Indian bowlers of the 1980s and 1990s.

40|$|Long {{continuous}} cellulose fibers are synthesized from cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) {{by using}} {{wet and dry}} <b>spinning</b> techniques. The <b>quality</b> of cellulose fibers will depend on several properties such as plant source, aspect ratio and alignment of cellulose nanofibrils. Nanofibrils are aligned during the flow in a capillary tube while spinning. Variation of flow parameters and geometry of the capillary tube can change the alignment of fibrils. In the present work, flow fields inside the capillary tube were generated by simulating the suspension by using a commercial finite element software and the parameters were changed systematically to observe their effect on the flow profiles and to co-relate the results with experimental studies conducted in Aalto University. Parameters selected for the present work were flow rate, concentration of CNF suspension, diameter and length of the capillary tube. Carreau model was used to predict the non-Newtonian behavior of CNF suspensions and its parameters were obtained by plot-fitting the rheological data. The work met with certain complexity due to highly non-linear behavior of the Carreau model with parameters fitted for rheological data of CNF suspensions. However, some important conclusions have been obtained from the results. It {{has been shown that}} the main parameter which affects the alignment of fibrils inside the flow is shear rate. Decreasing diameter and increasing flow rate both have resulted in increase in shear rate throughout the diameter of the capillary tube. Simulation of CNF suspensions with different concentrations resulted in an unexpected trend for velocity profiles and change in length of capillary did not affect velocity profiles or shear rate inside the capillary tube. The effect of these parameters was also studied for shear stress and it was shown that the change in diameter, flow rate and concentration of suspensions significantly change the trend of shear stress profiles...|$|R
