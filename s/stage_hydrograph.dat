40|$|The {{indirect}} measurement technique for discharge estimation, based on water level data analysis {{in two different}} river sections, is extended {{to the case of}} existing significant tributary flow between the two sections. The methodology is based on the calibration of a numerical flow routing algorithm, solving the Saint-Venant equations in diffusive form along the main channel between the two measurement sections. The first calibration parameter is the average Manning's roughness coefficient holding in the main channel, the other ones are relative to the rating curve of each tributary channel, estimated per unit roughness coefficient and per unit slope immediately before the junction of the tributary with the main channel. The new methodology is tested against different flood events observed along one gauged river reach: the Alzette river basin, in Luxembourg. The applied MAST hydraulic model solves the diffusive wave equations using the observed <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the upstream section as boundary condition. The observed <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the downstream section is used as benchmark function for the computation of the objective function to be minimized trough calibration. Field tests include comparison of the numerical results with historical discharge and water depth data available in the Alzette river...|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} hydrograph estimation in rivers based on reverse routing modeling and using only water level data at two gauged sections is here {{extended to the}} most general case of significant lateral flow contribution, without needing to deploy rainfall-runoff procedures. The proposed methodology solves the Saint-Venant equations in diffusive form also involving the lateral contribution using an ‘head driven’ modeling approach where lateral inflow {{is assumed to be}} function of the water level at the tributary junction. The procedure allows to assess the {{discharge hydrograph}} at ends of a selected river reach with significant lateral inflow, starting from the stage recorded there and without needing rainfall data. Specifically, the MAST 1 D hydraulic model is applied to solve the diffusive wave equation using the observed <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the upstream section as upstream boundary condition. The other required data are: 1) the observed <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the downstream section, as benchmark for the parameter calibration, 2) the bathymetry of the river reach, from the upstream section to a short distance after the downstream gauged section. The method is validated with different flood events observed in two river reaches with a significant intermediate basin, where reliable rating curves were available, selected along the Tiber River, in central Italy, and the Alzette River, in Luxembourg. Very good performance indices are found for the computed discharge hydrographs at both the channel ends and along the tributaries. The mean Nash Sutcliffe value (NSq) at the channel ends of two rivers is found equal to 0. 99 and 0. 86 for the upstream and downstream sites, respectively. The procedure is also validated on a longer stretch of the Tiber River including three tributaries for which appreciable results are obtained in terms of NSq for the computed dischargehydrographs at both the channel ends for three investigated flood events...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{research}} on groundwater and surfacewater interaction, attention {{has focused on}} the study of water exchanges between the near-stream aquifer and stream. One of the important near stream processes is bank storage. The aim of this thesis is to document the procedure required to develop a bank storage model that can be linked into a MODFLOW groundwater model. For this purpose, a groundwater model and a MATLAB code that can simulate bank storage process was developed. These two models were linked through the well package of MODFLOW. Result indicated that the number of stage rise and shape of <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> entering to stream system, when they have the same average stream stage, produced similar net flux of water between surface water and groundwater. In addition, the results show that reaches, which were gaining during normal flow of the stream network, can become a losing stream during high flow periods...|$|E
40|$|A {{real-time}} channel {{flood forecast}} model {{was developed to}} simulate channel flow in plain rivers based on the dynamic wave theory. Taking into consideration channel shape differences along the channel, a roughness updating technique was developed using the Kalman filter method to update Manning's roughness coefficient at each time step of the calculation processes. Channel shapes were simplified as rectangles, triangles, and parabolas, and the relationships between hydraulic radius and water depth were developed for plain rivers. Based {{on the relationship between}} the Froude number and the inertia terms of the momentum equation in the Saint-Venant equations, the relationship between Manning's roughness coefficient and water depth was obtained. Using the channel of the Huaihe River from Wangjiaba to Lutaizi stations as a case, to test the performance and rationality of the present flood routing model, the original hydraulic model was compared with the developed model. Results show that the <b>stage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> calculated by the developed flood routing model with the updated Manning's roughness coefficient have a good agreement with the observed <b>stage</b> <b>hydrographs.</b> This model performs better than the original hydraulic model...|$|R

The wave propagation in reservoirs is also dealtwith.

The computed results for the rigid bed agreed qualitatively with theexperimental ones regarding {{the effects of the}} initial storage depth, channel bedslope and bed roughness on the <b>stage</b> and velocity <b>hydrographs.</b> Modification of thebed roughness coefficient, however, would be needed to simulate accurately thewhole process of wave-front advance and height attenuation. The computationaland experimental results of <b>stage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> in the reservoirs coincided with eachother for the downstream advance waves, but for the upstream ones, which havethe smaller initial wave-height and propagate with the lower speed.

40|$|A new methodology, {{based on}} the {{synchronous}} measurement of <b>stage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> in two river sections located some kilometers from each other, was developed to estimate the discharge hydrograph in the upstream section.

The methodology was validated using results of laboratory experiments carried out at the Polytechnic of Bari University. A known discharge hydrograph was generated in the upstream tank of a rectangular flume, where two water level sensors were located. Two different bed materials have been used, to account for different roughness coefficients. Eight measured discharge hydrographs have been compared with the hydrographs computed using both a diffusive and a fully dynamic model. The diffusive model provides a good estimate of the measured discharge in the experiments with the highest roughness value...|$|R
40|$|The GIS {{database}} {{containing the}} topographic {{and land use}} information was made in 2012, followed by field measurements surveys in 2013 and 2014. A number of 11 cross-sections were topographically apprised in the valley along the 11 km river reach. The geometric data requirements for the modeling software were prepared in ESRI’s ArcGIS™ 9. 2 software using the HEC-GeoRAS extension. The steady flow data was edited in the HEC-RAS one-dimensional flow modeling software. Four scenarios {{were used for the}} river discharge, from normal to overflow. The results come in different forms, from tabular output, to <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> to velocity distribution or 3 D diagrams, all of which give a clear vision on the overflow high risk areas. The results were exported back to the GIS extension for additional spatial operations. Flow velocity maps were generated for each discharge scenario. Although the scenarios included very high discharge values, the flood impact on people assets is minimal.

40|$|Analysis of {{forecasts}} {{obtained by}} a forecasting {{model of the}} Muskingum type for real-time application, called STAFOM, shows that the model provides accurate forecast stage estimates {{for most of the}} selected case studies and flood events in the Upper-Middle Tiber River basin in Central Italy. However, three main issues affected STAFOM and in particular a) its kinematic nature, b) the lateral inflows representation and, finally, c) the occurrence of sudden fluctuations in water levels observed at the ends of the equipped river reach. Therefore, this simple stage forecasting model is here improved by incorporating a methodology relating local stage and remote discharge along river channels. This latter procedure, based on the Rating Curve Model (RCM), is capable of reconstructing discharge hydrograph at a river site where only stage is monitored, while the discharge is recorded at another section located far away and for which a significant lateral inflow contribution is expected. Application of the new model, named STAFOM-RCM, to several flood events that occurred along four equipped river reaches of the Upper Tiber River basin, shows that it improves the stage forecast accuracy both in terms of peak and <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> mainly for long river reaches, thus allowing to consider a longer forecast lead-time and hence avoiding the use of the old two-connecting river branch scheme which amplified the fluctuations in observed water levels...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} is proposed for estimating river discharge hydrographs during flood events, using only water level data measured at a gauged site, {{as well as}} 1 -D shallow water modelling and sporadic maximum surface flow velocity measurements. During flood, the piezometric level is surmised constant in the vertical plane of the river section, where {{the top of the}} banks is always above the river level, and is well represented by the recorded <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph.</b> The river is modelled along the reach directly located downstream the upstream gauged section, where discharge hydrograph is sought after. For the stability with respect to the topographic error, {{as well as for the}} simplicity of the data required to satisfy the boundary conditions, a diffusive hydraulic model is adopted for flow routing. Assigned boundary conditions are: (1) the recorded <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at the upstream river site and (2) the zero diffusion condition at the downstream end of the reach. The MAST algorithm is used for the numerical solution of the flow routing problem, which is embedded in the Brent algorithm used for the computation of the optimum Manning coefficient. Based on synthetic tests concerning a broad prismatic channel, the optimal reach length is chosen so that the approximated downstream boundary condition effects on discharge hydrograph assessment at upstream end are negligible. The roughness Manning coefficient is calibrated by using sporadic instantaneous surface velocity measurements during the rising limb of flood that are turned into instantaneous discharges through the solid of velocity estimated by a two-dimensional entropic model. Several historical events, occurring in three gauged sites along the upper Tiber River wherein a reliable rating curve is available, have been used for the validation. The analysis outcomes can be so summarized: (1) criteria adopted for selecting the optimal channel length and based on synthetic tests have been proved reliable by using field data of three gauged river sites. Indeed, for each of them a downstream reach, long not more than 500 m, is turned out fair for achieving good performances of the diffusive hydraulic model, thus allowing to drastically reducing the topographical data of river cross-sections; (2) the procedure for Manning's coefficient calibration allowed to get high performance of the hydraulic model just considering the observed water levels and sporadic measurements of maximum surface flow velocity during the rising limb of flood. Indeed, in terms of errors in magnitude on peak discharge, for the optimal calibration, they were found, in average, not exceeding 5 % for all events observed in the three investigated gauged sections, while the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency was, in average, greater than 0. 95. Therefore, the proposed procedure, apart from to have turned out reliable for the rating curve assessment at ungauged sites, can be applied in realtime for whatever flood conditions and this is of great interest for the practice hydrology seeing that, looking at new monitoring technologies, it will be possible to carry out velocity measurements by hand-held radar sensors in different river sites and for the same flood...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Flood wave {{propagation}} in river channel flow can be enunciated by nonlinear {{equations of motion}} for unsteady flow.

Hence, in this paper verification of the finite element model has been carried out against available numerical predictions and field data. The results of the model indicate a good matching with both Preissmann scheme and HEC-RAS model for a river reach of 29 km at both sites (15 km from upstream and at downstream end) for discharge hydrographs. It also has an agreeable comparison with the Preissemann scheme for the flow depth (<b>stage)</b> <b>hydrographs.</b> The proposed model has also been applying to forecast daily discharges at 400 km downstream in the Indus River from Sukkur barrage of Sindh, Pakistan, which demonstrates accurate model predictions with observed the daily discharges.

40|$|An {{automatic}} system {{was designed to}} concurrently measure stage and discharge {{for the purpose of}} developing stage-discharge ratings and high flow hydrographs on small streams. Stage, or gage height, is recorded by an analog-to-digital recorder and discharge is determined by the constant-rate tracer-dilution method. The system measures flow above a base stage set by the user. To test the effectiveness of the system and its components, eight systems, with a variety of equipment, were installed at crest-stage gaging stations across Iowa. A fluorescent dye, rhodamine-WT, was used as the tracer. Tracer-dilution discharge measurements were made during 14 flow periods at six stations from 1986 through 1988 water years. Ratings were developed at three stations with the aid of these measurements. A loop rating was identified at one station during rapidly-changing flow conditions. Incomplete mixing and dye loss to sediment apparently were problems at some stations. <b>Stage</b> <b>hydrographs</b> were recorded for 38 flows at seven stations.

40|$|Ground-water/surface-water {{interactions}} and MTBE contaminant plume discharge were investigated in a low-order river that experiences episodic river stage fluctuations. Results {{show that the}} hydraulic gradient fluctuates hourly to monthly due to river stage changes, water table recharge events, and reservoir gate adjustments. Hyporheic exchange driven by channel morphology creates small-scale gaining, losing, and parallel flow systems along the mostly gaining reach. During precipitation events, infiltrating rainfall rapidly saturates the extended capillary fringe and the shallow floodplain water table rises forming a ground-water ridge or mound and causing a steepened hydraulic gradient towards the river. The system response is magnified by watershed characteristics which control the river <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> including stormflow lag and flashiness. Results {{of this study suggest}} that a ground-water plume discharging to surface water may have several discharge locations related to transient water-table configurations. Under conditions of a low hydraulic gradient, the MTBE plume is deflected away from the river by hyporheic flow toward a downstream discharge location. When the gradient toward the river steepens in response to precipitation and gate closure, the small-scale hyporheic exchange systems are overcome and the plume discharges along the entire reach. Under these conditions, a high influx of contaminated ground water is discharged from the floodplain to the river, temporarily elevating river contaminant concentrations. During site investigation and monitoring, these transient spatial and temporal relationships could easily be missed by traditional site monitoring strategies...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} is proposed for estimating river discharge hydrographs during flood events, using only water level data {{at a single}} gauged site, as well as 1 -D shallow water modelling and occasional maximum surface flow velocity measurements. One-dimensional diffusive hydraulic model is used for routing the recorded <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> in the channel reach considering zero-diffusion downstream boundary condition. Based on synthetic tests concerning a broad prismatic channel, the "suitable" reach length is chosen {{in order to minimize}} the effect of the approximated downstream boundary condition on the estimation of the upstream discharge hydrograph. The Manning's roughness coefficient is calibrated by using occasional instantaneous surface velocity measurements during the rising limb of flood that are used to estimate instantaneous discharges by adopting, in the flow area, a two-dimensional velocity distribution model. Several historical events recorded in three gauged sites along the upper Tiber River, wherein reliable rating curves are available, have been used for the validation. The outcomes of the analysis can be summarized as follows: (1) the criterion adopted for selecting the "suitable" channel length based on synthetic test studies has proved to be reliable for field applications to three gauged sites. Indeed, for each event a downstream reach length not more than 500 m is found to be sufficient, for a good performances of the hydraulic model, thereby enabling the drastic reduction of river cross-sections data; (2) the procedure for Manning's roughness coefficient calibration allowed for high performance in discharge estimation just considering the observed water levels and occasional measurements of maximum surface flow velocity during the rising limb of flood. Indeed, errors in the peak discharge magnitude, for the optimal calibration, were found not exceeding 5 % for all events observed in the three investigated gauged sections, while the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency was, on average, greater than 0. 95. Therefore, the proposed procedure well lend itself to be applied for: (1) the extrapolation of rating curve over the field of velocity measurements (2) discharge estimations in different cross sections during the same flood event using occasional surface flow velocity measures carried out, for instance, by hand-held radar sensors...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical Research Abstracts Vol. 12, EGU 2010 - 3542 - 1, 2010 EGU General Assembly 2010 All {{hydrological}} handbooks contain {{methods for}} direct runoff and base-flow separation. The semi-log separation method {{is the most}} classical one. One can, however, question the physical base for such method. In addition, the water fluxes in the riverbed are important for ecology and water quality. In our study an 2 -D cross-section including {{the river and the}} surrounding aquifer was set-up in HYDRUS 2 D/ 3 D. Initial conditions were a steady-state subsurface flow feeding the river with a recharge from the soil surface. A surface runoff event was simulated by a rise and recession of the water level in the river. Differences between summer and winter situation were explored by given representative temperatures to the different components of the river-aquifer system. The simulations show that the fluxes are very different along the riverbed. Even during steady state baseflow we see that the fluxes through the bottom were 2 to 3 times smaller as compared to the side banks. During the hydrographs the proportion can become up to 5 times. Another interesting result is that within the time frame of the hydrograph and its immediate recession relatively little water, which pentetrated in the aquifer, returns to the river. Most of the water replenishes the aquifer and there is only a very small rise of baseflow. In our simulation we returned to the original level as before the hydrograph, so in reality even less or no rise in baseflow may occur immediately after a hydrograph. Of course, in a longer time-frame the recharge of the aquifer will give a rise to the actual subsurface drainage. The change in seasonal temperatures within the river-aquifer system has a substantial effect. For identical river <b>stage</b> <b>hydrograph</b> changes the hyporheic exchange fluxes are more intense in summer than in winter. If we define the hyporheic zone as the extedn to which the water fluxes from the river can penetrate, then we see that this zone is wider on the sides as compared {{to the bottom of the}} river. These findings should be validated in the field but have potentially important implications for ecology and mitigation of river water pollution. The fluxes through the side of the river cross-section appear to be more intense. status: publishe...|$|E

Consequently, a variety of empirical approaches have been developed which have limited rational validity. Hydrograph synthesis offers a reasonable approach to predicting the outflow hydrograph characteristics. In order to synthesize a hydrograph, it is necessary to mathematically describe the physical behavior of the dynamic processes involved in the hydrologic phenomena. Hydrograph synthesis may be considered to comprise (a) hydrographs (actual or simulated) of precipitation, (b) hydrographs of abstractions such as interception, infiltration, and depressional storage, (c) routing or translating the net rainfall rate (rate of rainfall excess) in finite intervals of time and distances up to the outlet point.

The simulation, according to monitored data, shows that the failure occurred three hours after the peak stage, during the inversion of flow (from the bank towards the river). A relatively limited development of positive pore pressures, reducing the effective stress and annulling the shear strength term due to the matric suction, and the sudden loss of the confining pressure of the river during the initial drawdown were responsible for triggering the mass failure. Results deriving from the seepage and stability analysis of nine selected flow events were then used to investigate the role of the flow event characteristics (in terms of peak <b>stages</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> characteristics) and of changes in bank geometry. Besides the peak river stage, which mainly controls the occurrence of conditions of instability, an important role is played by the hydrograph characteristics, in particular by the presence of one or more minor peaks in the river stage preceding the main on...|$|R
40|$|The Little Calumet River System {{located in}} Northwestern Indiana has {{encountered}} numerous flooding events in recent years. In 2008, Hurricane Ike contributed {{a large amount}} of rainfall to The Little Calumet River System leading to destructive flooding events. Following this flooding event, United States Army Corps of Engineers installed a flow diverter near a major tributary in the system for flood mitigation. Levees were also constructed for managing water movement. ^ In this study, a two stage modeling process commonly used in hydrologic modeling was considered. A rainfall – runoff model was prepared in the first stage using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System). Radar rainfall and point rainfall were considered and used to construct flow hydrographs from rainfall events. ^ In the second <b>stage,</b> flow <b>hydrographs</b> were used to model the flood stages in The Little Calumet River System. HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System) was used to conduct unsteady flow simulations. The HEC-RAS model was constructed with the help of field cross sectional surveys done by Purdue University Calumet senior design groups. Simulations were conducted with and without the diverter and levees to determine the performance of the flood management structures. ^ Peak flow and water surface elevations were considered and analyzed for The Little Calumet River System. With the construction of the diverter in the Little Calumet West reach, peak flow in the west reach decreased by 10. 19 %. Peak flow in the Little Calumet East River increased by 10. 05 % following the construction of the diverter. The water surface elevation did not show a significant change throughout the model. An increase in peak flow while maintaining a steady water surface elevation indicates that the construction of the diverter allows the system to direct a larger volume of water without increasing the possibility of flooding. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{propagation}} of flood wave through backwater reach is discussed by theexperiments {{conducted in the}} experimental flume of flood wave (1 50 m in length, 60 cm in width) at the down stream end of which three kinds of weir were set. It {{is well known that}} backwater reach can be devided into two regions from the standpointsof practice and of hydraulic behavior. : one is a storage region where the water level is nearlyhorizontal, and the other is a transition region which exists between storgage region anduniform reach upstream. Flood propagation through backwater reaches is gen?rally estimated by the graphical solu-tion of storage equation under assuming that any deformation of the discharge hydrograph doesnot occur in the transition region. The above treatment has practically sufficient accuracy for the case having a large storageregion such as a large reservoir, but it has no good accuracy for the case that the transitionregion has much effect. The authors studied the {{propagation of}} flood wave in such a case, and discussed thevarious kinds of characteristics such as the length of storage reach, deformation of <b>stage</b> andof discharge <b>hydrograph,</b> stage-discharge relationship and celerity of propagation of stagemax. and of discharge max...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{applicability}} of a hydraulic model on the transport process ofwash load developed in the previous study 1), we have been observing not only theconcentration of suspended load and water stage during a flood, but also the concentra-tion of suspended load twice {{a day in the}} drainage basin of the River Dido since Aprilof 1975. The concentration of wash load is dependent on whether the water discharge belongsto the period of rising stage or recession <b>stage</b> in a <b>hydrograph,</b> even if the water dis-charge is kept constant. The concentration in the period of rising stage is higher than thatof the recession stage. This may be due that the ratio of the discharge of sub-surfaceflow to the total discharge in the period of rising stage is less than that of the period ofrecession stage. It often appears that the concentration of wash load observed from April to July isgreater than one observed from August to November to the constant water discharge. This is related to seasonal variations of the concentration of wash load. Moreover, it was clarified that the concentration of wash load is affected by theduration time of low flow stage. These three elements which affect the concentration of wash load are discussed quali-tatively on the basis of observed results...|$|R

Hydraulic and physicochemical measurements were made on treated sewage effluent releases at established locations within the channel of an ephemeral stream, the Santa Cruz River of Southern Arizona. Water quality samples were taken in sequence so that incremental flows at different <b>hydrograph</b> <b>stages</b> could be traced as the effluent moved downstream. Hydrographs obtained from two H -L flumes were used to calibrate a modified kinematic wave model. Hydraulic parameters from the kinematic model and physicochemical measurements from water quality samples were combined together into a statistical-empirical kinetic model of nitrogen transformations which may occur in sewage effluent releases. There was fair agreement between the measured data and the nitrogen species values calculated with the model.

Bio-physicochemical measurements were made on treated sewage effluent releases at established locations within the channel of an ephemeral stream, the Santa Cruz River of Southern Arizona. Water samples were taken in chronological sequence as the effluent moved downstream, to trace changes in quality parameters during low and high <b>hydrograph</b> <b>stages.</b> Results indicate that dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at low effluent flows were higher than DO concentrations at high effluent flows; while, conversely, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations at low effluent flows were generally lower than BOD concentrations at high effluent flows. Biochemical oxygen demand concentrations are affected by waste loadings, flow conditions, phytoplankton growth and nitrification. Mean river deoxygenation rates (k) in sewage flows after six river miles from the Tucson Sewage Treatment Plant were always negative or increasing, indicative of nitrification, algal growth, and concentration of organic constituents through seepage losses...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates the numerical modelling aspects of unsteady flow in compound channels, with {{special interest in}} the "flood plain conveyance" aspects. This is examined through applications of three unsteady flow dynamic routing models: DWOPER, EXTRAN, and ONE-D to both laboratory and field data sets. In the context of applying DWOPER to the data sets three different approaches to define "off-channel" storage areas were considered. The first, which viewed the composite flow field as a single hydraulic unit without storage, produced significant differences between simulated and observed <b>stage</b> and discharge <b>hydrographs.</b> The second and third options separated the shallow and deep zones of the compound flow fields using different types of (imaginary) interface planes. The second option, which considered vertical interface planes, gave generally good results for the laboratory data but was less successful when applied to the field data. The third option used diagonal interface planes to define flood plain storage areas. The inclination of the diagonal plane to the horizontal (Θ) was adjusted to reflect changing hydraulic conditions. The form of the simulated hydrographs using this particular approach {{was found to be}} sensitive to variations in Θ. Statistical analyses were performed to determine optimum Θ-values {{for a wide range of}} hydraulic conditions. Finally, an equation was developed to define the flood plain hydraulic boundaries.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for simultaneous discharge and channel roughness estimation is developed {{and applied to}} data sets available at three experimental sites. The methodology {{is based on the}} synchronous measurement of water level data in two river sections far some kilometers from each other, {{as well as on the}} use of a diffusive flow routing solver and does not require any direct velocity measurement. The methodology is first analyzed for the simplest case of a channel with a large slope, where the kinematic assumption holds. A sensitivity and a model error analysis are carried out in this hypothesis in order to show the stability of the results with respect to the error in the input parameters in the case of homogeneous roughness and to analyze the effect of unknown roughness heterogeneity on the estimated discharges. The methodology is then extended to the more general case of channels with mild slope and validated using field data previously collected in three Italian rivers: the Arno (in Tuscany), the Tiber (in Latium) and the Vallo di Diana, a small tributary of the Tanagro river (in Southern Italy). The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated according to three performance criteria estimating the quality of the match between the measured and the computed <b>stage</b> and discharge <b>hydrographs.</b> Results of the field tests can be considered good, despite the uncertainties of the field data and of the measured values...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinematic}} wave {{model for}} overland and channel flow {{is used to}} develop a method to calculate the runoff hydrograph from a watershed consisting of a cascade of planes and channels. First, a general, semi-analytic solution based on the method of characteristics and incorporating flow on infiltrating surfaces is derived. Unrealistic properties of previous solutions based on the method of characteristics are avoided by defining lateral inflow {{in relation to the}} presence or absence of flowing water on the flow surface. It is shown that the new definition of lateral inflow results in both a more physically realistic representation of the overland and channel flow process during the recession <b>stage</b> of the <b>hydrograph</b> and a more accurate estimation of runoff volume than obtained by previous solutions. Second, the concept of the storage of water at kinematic equilibrium is used to calculate a depth-discharge coefficient for a single plane system and a two plane, one channel system, each of which is hydraulically equivalent to a complex cascade of planes and channels. The method is validated on two rangeland watersheds in Arizona. The results show that hydrographs generated from the two simplified watershed geometries are essentially the same as those from complex geometries when the duration of the runoff event is equal to or greater than the time to kinematic equilibrium. At durations less than the time to kinematic equilibrium, the two plane, one channel system preserves the complex geometry properties better than the single plane system...|$|R
