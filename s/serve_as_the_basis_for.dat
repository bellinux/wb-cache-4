5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the highway.|$|E
5|$|To restore his family's {{income and}} reputation, Grant wrote several {{articles}} on his Civil War campaigns for The Century Magazine at $500 each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, Robert Underwood Johnson, suggested that Grant {{write a book}} of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done. Grant's articles would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> several chapters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time.

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments {{is one of the most}} common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E

25|$|Pearson {{was born}} on November 30, 1893 in Columbus, Ohio. He would break into the film {{industry}} in 1929, writing the dialogue and titles to Mervyn LeRoy's Hot Stuff, {{which was one of}} the few films Hollywood produced which was a silent film with sound sequences. Pearson's play, Shoestring, would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Robert Lord's screenplay On With the Show!, which in 1929 became the first color sound film.|$|E

Notable examples of CAx include Computer-aided design (CAD software) and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.|$|E
25|$|Around 1900, the {{development}} of diamond saws and good jewelry lathes enabled {{the development}} of modern diamond cutting and diamond cuts, chief among them the round brilliant cut. In 1919, Marcel Tolkowsky analyzed this cut: his calculations took both brilliance (the amount of white light reflected) and fire into consideration, creating a delicate balance between the two. Tolkowsky's calculations would <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> all future brilliant cut modifications and standards.|$|E

25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} current {{homology}} modeling method takes its inspiration from calculations required {{to construct a}} three-dimensional structure from data generated by NMR spectroscopy. One or more target-template alignments are used to construct a set of geometrical criteria that are then converted to probability density functions for each restraint. Restraints applied to the main protein internal coordinates – protein backbone distances and dihedral angles – <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a global optimization procedure that originally used conjugate gradient energy minimization to iteratively refine the positions of all heavy atoms in the protein.|$|E

In 2012, a compilation of these papers were published in a book by World Scientific Publishing. The book's foreword is by Adler's son, Stephen L. Adler, and the diagrams by his daughter, Peggy Adler. Adler gave lectures about phyllotaxis at many universities and conferences in the United States and internationally, including the University of Kansas, The Institute for Advanced Study and West Point.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Intel 80386 CPU chip in October 1985, with 32-bit architecture and paging capabilities, provided personal computers {{with the ability to}} run multitasking operating systems like those of earlier minicomputers and mainframes. Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler, who had developed the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation. He would lead the development of the Windows NT operating system, which continues to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Microsoft's operating systems line. Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Inc., started NeXT Computer Inc., which developed the NEXTSTEP operating system.

25|$|In 1251, Mindaugas, pagan Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{concluded}} {{a peace treaty}} with the Livonian Order: {{he was to be}} baptized and crowned as King of Lithuania in return for portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava. Mindaugas was crowned on 6 July 1253 and the promised lands were transferred to the Order. The Order built the Memel Castle (Klaipėda) on the border with Samogitia to <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> further expansion. After Samogitians unsuccessfully attacked the new castle, their nobles formed a military coalition, elected Algminas (or Almenas) as their leader, and organized offensive raids to Courland. After the Samogitians defeated the knights near Klaipėda and killed 12 knights in 1257, a Samogitian envoy in Riga requested a two-year truce. The truce was supported by Riga merchants, who sought to increase wax and fur trade with the Samogitians.|$|E
