40|$|Micro-refrigerators {{that operate}} in the sub-kelvin regime are a key device in quantum technology. A well-studied candidate, an {{electronic}} cooler using Normal metal - Insulator - Superconductor (NIS) tunnel junctions offers substantial performance and power. However, its superconducting electrodes are severely overheated due to exponential suppression of their thermal conductance towards low temperatures, and the cooler performs unsatisfactorily - especially in powerful devices needed for practical applications. We employ a second NIS cooling stage to thermalize the hot superconductor at the backside of the main NIS cooler. Not only providing a lower bath temperature, the second <b>stage</b> <b>cooler</b> actively evacuates quasiparticles out of the hot superconductor, especially in the low temperature limit. The NIS cooler approaches its ideal theoretical expectations without compromising cooling power. This cascade design can also be employed to manage excess heat in other cryo-electronic devices...|$|E

40|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of cosmic {{sources in the}} far-infrared and X-ray bands require extreme sensitivity. The most sensitive detectors are cryogenic bolometers and calorimeters operating typically at about 100 mK. The last stage of cooling (from 300 mK to 100 mK) often poses significant difficulties in space-borne experiments, both in system complexity and reliability. We address {{the possibility of using}} refrigeration based on normal metal/insulator/superconductor (NIS) tunnel junctions as the last <b>stage</b> <b>cooler</b> for cryogenic thermal detectors. We compare two possible schemes: the direct cooling of the electron gas of the detector with the aid of NIS tunnel junctions and the indirect cooling method, when the detector lattice is cooled by the refrigerating system, while the electron gas temperature is decreased by electron-phonon interaction. The latter method is found to allow at least an order of magnitude improvement in detector noise equivalent power, when compared to the direct electron cooling. Comment: 3 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

Two versions of the two <b>stage</b> <b>cooler</b> have been constructed. The one with 'four valve operation' allowed active control of the gas flows. At the second stage a minimum temperature of 8 K was reached. The second stage reached 3 W at 20 K with simultaneously 15 W at 80 K at the first stage. One cooler was equipped with ErNi in the regenerator of the second stage. Operation in the double inlet mode resulted in a minimum temperature of 6. 2 K; at 20 K the refrigeration capacity was 4 W at the second stage and 15 W at 60 K at the first stage. (orig.)
