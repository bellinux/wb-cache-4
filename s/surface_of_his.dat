5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
25|$|The {{images in}} Haskins Posters traversed {{different}} creative themes that all became signature passions for Haskins' image-making {{over the next}} three decades; graphically strong compositions of nudes characterised by a natural essence in the models while the image-making explored themes of graphic experimentation, humour and sensual eroticism. Haskins has a recurring theme (rooted in his training as a painter) of creating tension in the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> photographs between flat graphic elements and 3D chiaroscuro. These results are often achieved with sophisticated lighting and/or double exposures. A highly creative and design driven approach to lighting almost always {{plays a key role in}} Haskins' work, both in the studio and on location. He often develops complex lighting designs for a single specific shot that are never repeated, the most recent example being a fashion shoot for New York magazine's 75th anniversary issue shot in New York's Pier 57 studios in August 2006.|$|E
500|$|It {{would appear}} that Bennett {{displayed}} and aroused greater emotion through his piano technique than from his compositions. Stanford writes that [...] "his playing... was undoubtedly remarkable and had a fire and energy in it which does not appear on the gentle <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music", and notes that Bennett's performances were eulogized by, amongst others, John Field, Clara Schumann, and Ferdinand Hiller.|$|E
50|$|Portis was re-signed by the Seahawks on April 3, 2013 to {{a two-year}} contract. On May 21, Portis was waived after news <b>surfaced</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> DUI arrest.|$|R
25|$|Laver's 200 singles {{titles are}} the most in tennis history. This {{included}} his all-time men's record of 10 or more titles per year for seven consecutive years (1964–70). He excelled on all <b>of</b> the court <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time: grass, clay, hard, carpet, and wood/parquet.|$|R
50|$|Edberg {{was most}} {{comfortable}} playing tennis on fast-playing <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>his</b> six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) {{and two were}} won on hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).|$|R
500|$|Alan Tudyk as Hoban [...] "Wash" [...] Washburne– Serenity {{pilot and}} Zoe's husband. Deeply {{in love with}} his wife, Wash expresses jealousy over his wife's [...] "war buddy" [...] {{relationship}} and unconditional support of their captain, most particularly in the episode [...] "War Stories", in which he confronts Mal, even as they are being tortured by a dissatisfied customer. He joined pilot training just to see the stars, which were invisible from the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> polluted homeworld, and he joined Serenity despite being highly sought after by other ships. He is very light-hearted and tends to make amusing comments, despite the severity of any situation.|$|E
2500|$|At first observation, the {{day after}} the operation, the back of Head's hand and the dorsal <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thumb were seen to be [...] "completely {{insensitive}} to stimulation with cotton wool, to pricking with a pin, and to all degrees of heat and cold." [...] While cutaneous sensibility had ceased, deep sensibility was maintained so that pressure with a finger, a pencil or with any blunt object was appreciated without hesitation.|$|E
2500|$|Fontana often {{lined the}} reverse of his canvases with black gauze so that the {{darkness}} would shimmer behind the open cuts and create a mysterious sense of illusion and depth. He then created an elaborate neon ceiling called [...] "Luce spaziale" [...] in 1951 for the Triennale in Milan. In his important series of Concetto spaziale, La Fine di Dio (1963–64), Fontana uses the egg shape. With his Pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, Fontana fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. In his Buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949-50, he punctured the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. From 1958 he purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewer’s attention on the slices that rend {{the skin of the}} canvas. In 1959 Fontana exhibited cut-off paintings with multiple combinable elements (he named the sets quanta), and began Nature, a series of sculptures made by cutting a gash across a sphere of terracotta clay, which he subsequently cast in bronze.|$|E
50|$|His {{work was}} {{generally}} less accomplished and his portraits more stiffly articulated {{than that of}} similar painters such as Daniel Mijtens. However, the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings are decorative and {{the background of the}} Portrait of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury contains an historically important view of Hatfield House with sportsmen in the foreground.|$|R
50|$|Hellmich’s work {{consists}} of large-scale, oil-on-canvas paintings that depict imagined architectural spaces {{with an emphasis}} on texture, geometry and form. Countering the vivid illusory dimension, Mr. Hellmich varies the paint quality {{to call attention to the}} material <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pictures. Paint is troweled, streaked, dripped, scumbled and otherwise given a suave, sensuously physical presence.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} with Fulham , Dejagah resided in London, England, with his German-Iranian wife and {{daughter}} whose names are inscribed on the external <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Nike Mercurial boots. He has tattoos with Berlin on one arm and Tehran on the other, and the phrase, [...] "Never forget where you're from" [...] on his neck.|$|R
2500|$|The {{furnaces}} at Cornwall Furnace {{went through}} {{two stages of}} technology. Peter Grubb was born in Delaware about 1702 and settled {{in what is now}} Lebanon County in 1734. [...] He bought about [...] of magnetite rich land. Grubb also noticed that his land had the other natural resources needed to produce iron. Namely, vast stands of timber for the production of charcoal, running water to operate the bellows, and an ample supply of limestone needed to add flux to the smelting furnaces. Grubb's plans were further helped {{by the fact that the}} magnetite at Cornwall was either very close to or on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> land. He was ready to venture into the iron business and set about the task of building an iron [...] "plantation". These centers of iron production were usually located well away from the heavily cleared farmlands and were nestled in the Ridge and Valley section of Pennsylvania. Grubb constructed his furnaces, first a bloomery and later the more modern charcoal-fired blast furnace and the support buildings and mill village that was needed to house his workers. [...] He named his operation Cornwall because his father, John Grubb had come from Cornwall, UK in 1677. [...] Cornwall Iron Furnace was an excellent fit for the agricultural based economy of the Thirteen Colonies. Iron was needed to make into tools, nails and weapons. The official policy of Great Britain frowned on manufacturing in the colonies, but England was no longer able to produce the needed iron for its needs let alone the needs of the colonists. In fact England had become dependent on importing iron from Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|Salimbeni {{returned}} to Siena in 1595. Here he persisted in a Reformist or Counter-Maniera style. He was here influenced by Federico Barocci {{as can be}} seen in the draperies, highlighted with abrupt changes of light and flickering <b>surfaces,</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> painting [...] "Birth of a Virgin" [...] in the San Domenico church in Ferrara (1607-1608).|$|R
5000|$|Schoeler's work {{is often}} {{concerned}} {{with the ideas of}} fragility, beauty, vulnerability, as well as representations of youth and masculinity."Seen up close, the rich rendering <b>of</b> the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> models' skin is second only to the rich <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the paintings themselves. It’s hard not to get lost in what he describes as the boundary between what is on the inside and what is on the outside." ...|$|R
50|$|Krut’s {{technique}} is {{to construct the}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> canvases with layers of colourful paint. There is a strong relationship {{to the structure of}} drawing and use of flattened pictorial space. Each canvas carries a particular and spirited character: fans, vortexes, geometric angles, dynamic and judiciously suggestive organic shapes recur throughout his compositions, revealing an abstracted, abject portraiture.|$|R
60|$|Father Benwell {{listened to}} this rhapsody--so {{characteristic}} of the childish simplicity of the man--with an inward sense of impatience, which never once showed itself on the smiling <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} quite make out whether the banker was serious or not in all this talk; {{sometimes}} I suspected him of a fine mockery, but the Altrurian took him upon the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> words.|$|E
60|$|There {{stood the}} Doctor, quite still, with his large yellow eye fixed on Mr. Mackaw. At length he {{perceived}} the cold pasty, {{and his little}} black wings began to flutter on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> immense body.|$|E
50|$|His {{preferred}} {{weapons are}} specialized high tech needles {{with which he}} can shower a deadly barrage upon opponents. He has also used swords, armor, laser cannons, and an inter-dimensional teleportation device. Using a ninja technique, Slaymaster toughened the striking <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand to produce a tough callous and sharpened it to produce a deadly razor edge, providing him with a built-in bladed weapon.|$|R
5000|$|Coper would {{characteristically}} {{throw his}} work on the potter's wheel, then alter and assemble pieces by hand to achieve the finished form. Thus, although made on the wheel, his work has a sculptural quality, but is always functional. The <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pots tend to be roughly textured and coloured with oxides, especially manganese oxide. His distinctive pots take on recognizable [...] "forms" [...] he termed Spade, Bud, Cup, Egg, Flower and Arrow.|$|R
50|$|Smith's work {{includes}} {{a combination of}} jewelry (rings, bracelets, pendants) and functional objects such as teapots, goblets, flasks, urns and keepsake boxes. He designs, forms and fabricates each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works by hand. The patterns <b>of</b> ornamentation in <b>his</b> works are frequently cut from silver sheet and soldered or annealed to base plate. The <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works often feature applied patinas or hammered textures. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works are adorned with semi-precious or precious stones, bone, horn, and even ancient mastodon tusk from glacier-finds in Alaska and Siberia.|$|R
6000|$|He {{abandoned}} {{himself to}} a fancy which had been working to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thought. [...] "We could call it our Silver Wedding Journey, and go round to all the old places, and {{see them in the}} reflected light of the past." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{characters}} {{could hardly}} be wider apart, than the size and development of man's brain, {{and the distribution of}} hair upon the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body; yet they both lead us to the same conclusion--that some other power than Natural Selection has been engaged in his production.|$|E
60|$|He made {{no sign of}} greeting; {{neither did}} Mr Verloc, who {{certainly}} knew his place; but a subtle change about the general outlines of his shoulders and back suggested a slight bending of Mr Verloc’s spine under the vast <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat. The effect was of unobtrusive deference.|$|E
50|$|Oddjob's {{real name}} is unknown. He is named by Goldfinger to {{describe}} his duties to his employer. A Korean, like all of Goldfinger's staff, he is extremely strong, as shown in one sequence where he breaks the 'massive' oak railing of a staircase with karate chops <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand and a mantel with his foot. When Bond expresses surprise at these feats, Goldfinger explains that Oddjob trains extensively to toughen the striking <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet, which have developed a tough callous which significantly increases his striking power.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s Taylor's work in glass turned to classic vessel forms based on ancient Greek kraters, lekythoi and amphoras. At first the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> these bulging forms displayed colorful spots and splotches that contrasted with the solid body color of the vessels; but a trip to the desert regions of Idaho and Oregon influenced Taylor to wrap the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vessels in landscape-like configurations of color. In 1980 Taylor returned briefly to ceramic, folding and draping slabs of porcelain into twisting, gestural forms. These he airbrushed in black and brown glazes to emphasize the forms' depth.|$|R
5000|$|Akaji learned welding {{from a local}} {{mechanic}} and is now {{best known}} for his large-scale welded copper and brass sculptures, which are both organic and abstract in nature, as typified by Cyparissus,. The welded and/or pounded <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sculptures are often warm and sensual and over time develop a unique patina. He died in 2002. The Hawaii State Art Museum and the Honolulu Museum of Art are among the public collections holding work by Bumpei Akaji. His sculptures in public places include: ...|$|R
60|$|He shuddered lightly now and again, as {{they stepped}} lurching down the hill. He set his jaws hard to {{suppress}} this shuddering. It {{was not in}} his limbs, or even on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, for Helena did not notice it. Yet he shuddered almost in anguish internally.|$|E
60|$|Sigsbee's benevolence was {{expanding}} {{under the}} influence of the Scotch highball and his cigar. Little acts of kindness on Archie's part, here a cigar, there a lunch, at another time seats for the theatre, began to rise to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> memory like rainbow-coloured bubbles. He wavered.|$|E
6000|$|Jos. [...] Oh! he is good! [...] Condemn him {{not from}} his own mouth, but trust [...] To me, who have borne so much with him, and for him, [...] That this is but the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul, [...] 160 [...] And that the depth is rich in better things.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career (1942-52) he worked in a French-influenced post-Cubist style. The sculpted, [...] "hammered" [...] <b>surface</b> texture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{strongly}} composed paintings was created using regular, abrupt brush strokes.|$|R
50|$|Karnak has {{enhanced}} strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> genetically superior Inhuman physiology. Unlike most other Inhumans, {{he does not have}} superhuman powers because he was never exposed to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. Instead, Karnak has the extrasensory ability (achieved through meditation and intensive training) to perceive stress points, fracture planes, or weaknesses in objects or persons. He has complete voluntary control <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> autonomic bodily functions. All striking <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body are extremely toughened. He is capable of shattering substances up to and including mild steel and rendering superhuman opponents unconscious by striking them.|$|R
50|$|In his {{exhibitions}} Jongeleen {{brings the}} street {{within the walls}} of the White Cube. His works are made of discarded hardboard on which short critical quotes are sprayed. Jongeleen finds these texts on websites such as Geen Stijl, Spitsnieuws and Retecool, which publicize sharp opinionated pieces focused on news, actual events and politics. On these websites Jongeleen selects opinions on contemporary art, spraying these quotes onto the <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artworks. By this Jongeleen tries {{to call attention to the}} public ideas on art.|$|R
