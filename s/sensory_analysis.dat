5|$|The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies, {{a two-story}} {{distillery}} building dating to around 1889, {{is used for}} the Professional Wine Studies program and was named after the Rudd family of Rudd Farms. The building has <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> classrooms with wireless keypad response systems, built-in light boxes, and expectoration stations. The Rudd Center contains a pantry, a 4,000-bottle wine cave and private dining room, and a terrace. Karen MacNeil is the creator and chairman of the center. The building opened in 2003 for a wine professional credential; the school began its wine and beverage certification program in 2010. In 2013 the school began a wine, beverage, and hospitality concentration in its bachelor's degree program.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the <b>sensory</b> <b>analysis</b> (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{sensor network}} {{applications}} are data-centric, and data analysis {{plays an important}} role in these applications. However, it is a challenging task to find out what specific problems and requirements <b>sensory</b> data <b>analysis</b> will face, because these applications are tightly embedded in the physical world and the sensory data reflect the physical phenomena being monitored. In this paper, we propose to use field studies as an alternative for identifying these problems and requirements. Specifically, we deployed an experimental sensor network for monitoring the frog pond in our university and analyzed the collected sensory data. We present our methodology of sensory data collection and analysis. We also discuss preliminary analytical results from the collected sensory data, together with our generalization for similar sensor network applications. We find that this case study helped us identify and understand several problems, either general or specific, in real-world sensor network application deployment and <b>sensory</b> data <b>analysis.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aroma of}} sweet Fiano wine, the most {{representative}} non-aromatic white wine variety in southern Italy, was evaluated by <b>sensory</b> and instrumental <b>analysis</b> {{to determine the}} influence of grape overripeness, drying and Botrytis cinerea infection. <b>Sensory</b> descriptive <b>analysis</b> was used to evaluate the sensory properties of wines. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O) techniques were used to identify and to determine the content of free and bound volatile compounds and their odour impact. A <b>sensory</b> descriptive <b>analysis</b> had revealed that the sensory descriptors such as citrus jam, dried apricot, dried figs, prune, honey and coconut, occur in sweet Fiano wine more than in base Fiano wine. Thirty five free volatile compounds had higher levels in sweet Fiano wine than in base Fiano wine, these components were mostly terpenes, β-damascenone, lactones, aldehydes and ketones. Moreover higher levels of terpenes, β-damascenone, benzyl alcohol and 2 -phenylethanol were found in the bound volatile fraction of sweet Fiano wine. The main odour impact compounds in sweet Fiano wine were nerol, geraniol and linalool (orange flowers), vitispirane (camphor), lactones such as γ-nonalactone (coconut), δ-decalactone and γ-decalactone (apricot) and 1 -octen- 3 -ol (mushroom). These differences appear to be {{due to the fact that}} grape overripeness and the drying process allows concentration of varietal aromatic compounds and an easier transfer of them from skins to must during vinificatio...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the intensity of synthesis of volatile aroma compounds by Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) on sunflower husks and barley straw using <b>sensory</b> profile <b>analysis</b> and UV spectroscopy. The main cultural and morphological characteristics of the mycelial growth and development of fruiting bodies are determined: the period of mycelial development on the substrate, the time of primordial formation, the number of mushroom bunches per unit volume of substrate, the morphology of carpophores. Characteristic attributes of the aroma of dried fruiting bodies (mushroom, woody, sweet, herbaceous, fish, meat, floral, earthy, acidic, putrescent) are established and their aroma profiles are built. <b>Sensory</b> profile <b>analysis</b> of flavor of dried samples showed that the mushroom flavor of fungi cultivated on the sunflower husk is more pronounced than of those grown on barley straw. The light absorption maxima are recorded in the ranges 204 – 210 and 250 – 290 nm according to UV absorption spectra. Optimal conditions for extracting aromatics from dried fungi samples are the extraction time of 20 – 35 min at the boiling point of the solvent. Analysis of the UV spectra of fungal alcohol and hexane extracts showed that the intensity of the synthesis of volatile compounds is higher for strains cultivated on sunflower husks than for samples obtained on barley straw...|$|R
