5|$|James Fletcher was {{responsible}} for early planning of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program during his first term as administrator under President Nixon.

5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> mission {{and the third}} flight of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E

5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E

He piloted STS-121 in 2006 and commanded STS-124 in 2008 and STS-134 in 2011. STS-134 was his final mission and the final mission of <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Endeavour.|$|E

5|$|STS-74 was {{the fourth}} mission of the US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the second docking of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> with Mir. <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Atlantis lifted off from Kennedy Space Center launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of Atlantis back at Kennedy. It was the second {{in a series of}} seven {{straight}} missions to the station flown by Atlantis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> {{became the}} {{major focus of}} NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a {{frequently}} launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.|$|E
5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} to the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E

5|$|Each <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
