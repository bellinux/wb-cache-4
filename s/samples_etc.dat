5000|$|Although {{the method}} of sample {{collection}} is different for soil, water <b>samples,</b> <b>etc.,</b> the extraction-derivatization is generally similar to the following protocol from an article on soil microbial communities. [...] The lipids were extracted from the dried soil sample by use of a chloroform-methanol-phosphate buffer mixture by use of a brief sonication followed by shaking for 2 hours and centrifugation to pellet the soil material. The liquid above the soil had additional chloroform and water added to cause separation of the lipid-containing chloroform from the buffer/methanol phase. The lipids were fractionated on a solid-phase extraction column and the neutral lipids, free fatty acids and other materials discarded and the phospholipid phase then dried, prior esterification to form the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) to make them suitable for analysis.|$|E

They can be either man-made (artifacts, tools, utensils, etc.) or naturally occurring (specimens, <b>samples,</b> <b>etc.),</b> usually borrowed, purchased, or received as donation by a teacher, library, or museum for use in classroom instruction or in exhibits. Archival and manuscript collections often receive items of memorabilia such as badges, emblems, insignias, jewelry, leather goods, needlework, etc., in connection with gifts of personal papers. Most government or institutional archives reject gifts of non-documentary objects unless they have a documentary value. When accepting large bequests of mixed objects they normally have the donors sign legal documents giving permission to the archive to destroy, exchange, sell or dispose in any way those objects which, according to the best judgement of the archivist, are not manuscripts (which can include typescripts or printouts) or are not immediately useful for understanding the manuscripts.|$|E
5000|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) is {{an analytical}} technique in which chemical species are ionized and sorted before detection, {{and the resulting}} mass spectrum is used to identify the ions' parent molecules. Spectroscopy is often {{used in conjunction with}} many techniques that are seen in microfluidic applications; incubation of cells within single droplets, droplet-based reaction vessels, sorting of small volume <b>samples,</b> <b>etc.,</b> to identify experimentally relevant species. This makes scalable spectroscopic techniques relevant in the field of microfluidics to reduce the overall workload and resource utilization necessary in carrying out microscale fluid-based experiments. There are many cases in which other spectroscopic methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence, infrared, or Raman, are not viable as standalone methods due to the particular chemical composition of the droplets, which are often sensitive to fluorescent labels, or contain species that are otherwise indeterminately similar, where MS may be employed along with other methods to characterize a specific analyte of interest. Scarcity and difficulty of separation/purification make entirely microfluidic scale systems coupled to mass spectrometry ideal in the fields of proteomics [...] enzyme kinetics, drug discovery, and newborn disease screening. The two methods of ionization for mass analysis most commonly used in droplet-based microfluidics today are matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), with surface acoustic wave nebulization (SAWN) approaches being developed as well.|$|E

40|$|Pack {{carburization}} is {{the oldest}} method among the case-hardening treatments, and sufficient attempts have not been made to understand this process in terms of heat and mass transfer,effect of alloying elements, dimensions of the <b>sample,</b> <b>etc.</b> Thus, a two-dimensional mathematical model in cylindrical coordinate is developed for simulating the pack carburizationprocess for chromium-bearing steel in this study. Heat and mass balance equations are solved simultaneously, where the surface temperature of the sample varies with time, but the carbon potential at the surface during the process remains constant. The fully implicit finite volume technique is used to solve the governing equations. Good agreement has been found between the predicted and published data. The effect of temperature, carburizing time, dimensions of the <b>sample,</b> <b>etc.</b> on the pack carburizing process shows some interesting results. It is found that the two-dimensional model gives better insight into understanding the carburizing process...|$|R
