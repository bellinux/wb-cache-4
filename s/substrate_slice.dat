40|$|In {{context of}} a European Commission funded project, {{development}} of a standardized multifunctional stacked 3 D package was envisioned for potential applications in aviation, space and telecommunication sectors. The standardization and modularity was aimed to integrate packages from different technologies and to allow mutual slice inter-changeability. Thermal management solutions to the proposed new stacked 3 D package as per the project specifications (a total of three stacked substrate slices, each slice of size 55 × 55 × 1 mm 3 and total package height not exceeding 10. 5 mm) are reported here. Three potential options were studied i. e. (a) module liquid cooling, (b) integration of miniature copper-water cylindrical heat pipes (OD 3. 0 mm) with the 1. 0 mm <b>substrate</b> <b>slice</b> and (c) development of flat plate heat pipes of 0. 9 mm thickness. For options (a) and (b), initial tests have been performed taking aluminum as a representative material for AlSiC metal matrix composites which were to be employed in the final design. Further, copper based flat plate micro-structure conventional heat pipes have been developed and performance tested. Thermal interactions have been investigated with thermocouples coupled with infrared thermography. For safe operation up to 30 W heating power (10 W/slice), while thermal diffusion through the bare metallic substrate is sufficient for heat transfer from chip to the substrate, micro heat pipes should be employed to cool the substrate and transfer heat from it to an external cold plate. Flat plate heat pipes are advantageous for higher power levels per slice. Interlayer thermal interactions also affect the response of stacked 3 D packages...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{aim of this}} in vitro {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} which surface treatment and adhesive type might provide the most predictable microshear bond strength results of repair resin composite to lithium disilicate ceramic and a newly introduced resin nanoceramic (RNC). MethodsA total of thirty six slices were prepared out of resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate) and lithium disilicate (IPS e. max CAD ceramic blocks) with dimensions of 14  ×  12  ×  3  mm (n =  18 for each material). The slices were divided into three main groups according to surface treatment: Control group (CN) received no treatment, group (DB) roughened with diamond bur and group (CJ) silica coated with Cojet system. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups according {{to the type of}} adhesive system used for repair: Subgroup (MH) : Treated with Monobond plus and Heliobond adhesive system and subgroup (SBU) : treated with Single bond universal adhesive system. The adhesives were applied according to the manufacturers' instructions. Five transparent microtubules were adjusted on each <b>substrate</b> <b>slice</b> and then repair resin composite (Tetric Evoceram, shade A 3) was applied and light cured (n =  15 for each subgroup). After 24  h storage in distilled water, microshear bond strength (μSBS) was measured for each specimen of tested groups. ResultsLava Ultimate RNC showed statistically significant higher μSBS compared to IPS e. max lithium disilicate ceramic. The use of diamond bur in conjunction with Monobond plus and Heliobond adhesive system showed higher μSBS compared to all tested groups. ConclusionsThe effect of different surface treatments on the μSBS to the repair resin composite is material dependent. Combination of the abrasive action of diamond bur and adhesive with separate silane treatment modalities had a synergistic influence on μSBS of the repair resin composite under the current circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{cutting of}} {{visco-elastic}} polymers is experimentally investigated using sharp knives. The knife is aligned orthogonally to the substrate’s surface, and is {{forced into the}} substrate. Two cutting scenarios are investigated i) plunge cutting, where the knife edge moves directly into the <b>substrate,</b> and ii) <b>slicing,</b> where the knife shears tangentially as it moves into the <b>substrate.</b> For <b>slicing</b> fracture lines emanating from the cut are observed, and the threshold forces for cutting are considerably smaller, indicating that the two cutting processes are very different. ...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{experiments}} using wire-saw {{techniques to}} slice thin silicon wafers are described. <b>Substrates</b> were <b>sliced</b> directly to 17 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil thicknesses. Some of the 8 mil substrates {{and all of}} the 5 mil substrates were chemically etched to 7 and 4 mils, respectively, to guarantee removal of any saw damage. The wafers wire sawed to 17 mil thicknesses were processed as reference cells. A baseline process which results in an n(+) -p cell structure, and two advanced processes which provide n(+) -p-p(+) structures were utilized. By using a p(+) enhancement layer on the solar cell back surface, the performance of the 7 mil wafers was increased to exceed that of the 17 mil solar cells with simple n(+) -p structures. Cells fabricated by an ion implantation sequence utilizing elemental boron and phosphorus implants were shown to be capable of equalling or exceeding the performance of cells fabricated by an equivalent all-diffusion process...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{activation of the}} prodrug N-acetyl-L [...] y-glu-tamyl sulfamethoxazole (AGSM) and of-y-glutamyl sulfameth-oxazole (GSM) {{as a model for}} the {{mechanism of}} the renal selectivity of N-acetyl [...] y-glutamyl prodrugs was investigated. The hypothesis was tested that this selectivity is due largely to a carrier-mediated transport followed by an intracellular conversion of the prodrug to the active drug, in contrast to another mecha-nism. The transport of AGSM and GSM was studied with the use of kidney slices. AGSM accumulated in the slices. At 75 M <b>substrate</b> concentration, the <b>slice</b> to medium ratio was 2. 5 ± 0. 2. This accumulation was inhibited by the anion transport inhibitor probenecid (82 % inhibition at 1. 0 mM) and by the-y-glutamyl transport inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (60 % at 1. 0 mM). Acivicin, L-(aS,a-amino- 3 -chloro- 4, 5 -dihydro- 5 -isoxa-zole acetic acid did not inhibit AGSM accumulation at 0. 1 mM,...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{emerging}} geo-distributed services, {{there is}} a need to coordinate the use of resources offered by field-area networks. In the case of vehicular networks, such resources include the processing, sensing, and storage capabilities offered to service providers for urban sensing or intelligent transportation. In this paper, we propose to virtualize the resources embedded on the vehicular nodes to allow multiple tenants to coexist and deploy their services on the same underlying mobile substrate. Virtualization is the task of an infrastructure provider that controls the mobile <b>substrate</b> and allocates <b>sliced</b> resources to the tenants. A service results from a collection of virtual machines hosted on the mobile nodes allocated by the infrastructure provider. Efficient utilization of the node resources may trigger virtual machine migrations. We study the problem of virtual machine migrations through V 2 V communications between mobile nodes. To evaluate the impact of such migrations on the resource allocation process, we use the real traces of a bus transit system to simulate a vehicular network where virtual machines migrate via V 2 V communications. Our results show that virtual machines of several hundreds of Megabytes can migrate between moving buses. We then discuss design principles and research issues toward the full virtualization of opportunistic networks...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Biochemical {{studies of}} phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) and mercuric acetate {{toxicity}} in rats carried out during this investigation were (1) the metabolism of ²⁰³Hg(Ac) ₂ and ²⁰³Hg-PMA within kidney and liver tissues following oral ingestion, (2) {{the effect on}} some soluble enzyme activities and determinations of ²⁰³Hg binding in the enzyme fractions, and (3) the metabolism of ¹⁴C-labeled <b>substrates</b> by kidney <b>slices</b> from control animals and animals receiving PMA and Hg(Ac) ₂. In vitro ²⁰³Hg binding of the kidney soluble proteins was determined after incubating the soluble fraction with ²⁰³mercury labeled Hg(Ac) ₂ and PMA. The proteins were separated by Sephadex G- 100 gel filtration and the ²⁰³Hg and O. D. ₂₆₀[subscript]mμ were determined in the eluate. Hg-binding depended {{on the type of}} mercurial and its concentration, and Hg did not seem to combine selectively with any particular group of proteins. Incubation of kidney slices in PMA solution resulted in mercury binding to groups of proteins of the soluble fraction in the 100, 000 (peak I), 40, 000 to 60, 000 (peak II) and the 8, 000 to 13, 000 (peak III) molecular weight ranges, and incubation of Hg(Ac) ₂ showed mercury binding to the peak I and III proteins. These binding patterns were different from those obtained with in vitro incubation of the soluble fraction. In vivo metabolism of ²⁰³Hg from a single dose of PMA or Hg(Ac) ₂ resulted in a very large portion of ²⁰³Hg being bound to the peak III proteins, especially after 48 hours. PMA and Hg(Ac) ₂ treatment resulted in different ²⁰³Hg-binding patterns the first 48 hours, especially in peaks I and II, and gradually became similar after that. Rats receiving multiple doses of PMA or Hg(Ac) ₂ also showed similar labeling patterns in the kidney soluble proteins. However, the O. D. profile was definitely altered, with an increase of O. D. in the area of peak III. Single dose of PMA or Hg(Ac) ₂, slightly increased the level of kidney soluble lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH). Multiple doses of PMA or Hg(Ac) ₂ decreased the LDH activity levels in the kidney soluble fraction. The maximum bindings were around 0. 32 and 0. 50 mole Hg/mole protein in the LDH fraction for Hg(Ac) ₂ and PMA respectively. When the kidney soluble fraction was incubated in 1 x 10 ⁻⁴M Hg(Ac) ₂, about 2 - 4 moles of Hg were bound per mole of protein, and the LDH activity was not affected. LDH in the rat kidney did not return to a normal value with a significant decrease in mercury binding when a 2 week period of time was allowed to lapse following Hg(Ac) ₂ dosage. It is highly possible that mercury binding at the active site of LDH enzyme is not the prime factor involved for the reduction of activity. It may be that the synthesis of enzyme is affected. Single or multiple PMA dosage did not affect malic acid dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. A single dose of Hg(Ac) ₂ showed no effect on MDH activity, but multiple doses showed a decrease. The Hg-binding was less than one mole of Hg/mole of protein in the MDH fraction. It seems doubtful that Hg binding at the active site of the MDH molecule is the main reason for the decrease of MDH activity following in vivo treatment. When kidney slices were incubated with lactate- 1 -¹⁴C, - 2 -¹⁴C, or glutamate- 3, 4 -¹⁴C, a marked difference between those taken from control rats and from rats receiving oral doses of PMA (Hg accumulation; 198 μg²⁰³Hg/gr. fr. wt. kidney) or Hg(Ac) ₂ (98 μg²⁰³Hg/gr. fr. wt. kidney) was observed. The effects were not due to an inhibition of lactate or glutamate uptake by the slices. Complete metabolism of labeled lactate or glutamate to CCO₂ and lactate-l- or - 2 -¹⁴C incorporation into glutamate were definitely affected more by PMA, and to a lesser degree by Hg(Ac) ₂. It seems possible that in vivo mercurial treatment induced an inhibition of decarboxyla se activity in the kidney. Due to a reduction of lactate-¹⁴C conversion through the decarboxylating pathway, a greater amount of lactate would become available for its metabolism through another pathway (a combination of assimilation followed by a degradation). A larger second peak which was found in all runs with kidney slices from mercurial treated rats illustrates this alteration. A delay of 2 or 3 hours for the appearance of the second peak may be explained by the overall depression of metabolic reactions. A decrease in respiration of isolated kidney tissues following toxic doses of both inorganic and organic mercurials has been reported...|$|R
