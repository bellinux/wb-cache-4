40|$|Abstract—Micrometer and sub-micrometer sized {{non-magnetic}} particles were {{manipulated by}} an external strong magnetic field (e. g., 10 Tesla) {{with a high}} gradient. During the strong magnetic field effects, <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> the non-magnetic <b>particles</b> was observed {{which could not be}} realised only with gravitational field.

Combining the experimental results and theoretical analysis, particle-particle magnetic interaction was found to influence the overall <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> as well. Magnetised by the strong magnetic field, magnetic interaction between non-magnetic particles becomes dominant and a self-assembly behavior can be demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceWe report {{experimental}} and theoretical results on <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in sandy bottom under {{the action of}} oscillating velocity field due to surface waves. Experiments were performed in-situ and in wave flume. Segregation in the mixtures of light and heavy particles of the same diameter and small and large particles of the same density was observed. It was found that segregation appears on the background of sand ripples generation in the upper «active» zone of the bottom. The thickness of this zone {{is proportional to the}} amplitude of velocity oscillation. The topology of segregation patterns depends on particle size differences, on particle density differences as well as on particle percentage composition in the mixture. It was revealed that small particles with small percentage are concentrated below sandy ripples crest. If percentage composition of small and large particles are approximately equal, the large particles are concentrated below the ripples crests. Light particles quite the «active» zone where concentration of heavy particles increases. To investigate the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> we use non-linear diffusion equations in the presence of gravity field like it was done recently in paper of Fernandez et al (Physica A, 2003, 327, 94 – 98).

40|$|Entrained-flow {{slagging}} coal gasifiers display large conversion efficiencies and small levels of unconverted carbon at the exhaust. Both features are apparently {{at odds with}} the fairly small “space-time”of the particle-laden gas feeding, as compared with the time scale of heterogeneous gasification of carbon. This apparent inconsistency can be explained by considering that fuel residence times are longer than the “space-time”due to <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>particles</b> in the near-wall region <b>of</b> the gasifier. <b>Segregation</b> is promoted by swirl flow, by particle–wall interaction as the wall is covered by a molten layer of slag and by the establishment of a dense-dispersed flow of granular solids in the proximity of the wall. This study presents results of granular flow simulations of the interaction of a dense-dispersed parti- cle flow with the confining wall. Simulations consider that both the particles and the wall may be either “sticky”or “non sticky”, based on the prevailing elastic vs plastic behaviour upon collision. The effect of drag forces exerted on particles by swirled gas flow is simulated in a simplified manner. Particle–particle collisions are modelled with a Hertzian approach that includes torque and cohesion. The extent and time scale <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> a lump <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> loaded into a cylindrical vessel are assessed.

The existence of circles with an intermediate radius shows that the segregation at an intermediate level within a flow is possible. In this paper, we experimentally study the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> of different densities and sizes in a half-filled rotating drum and other devices (chute flow, pile). In the drum, the location of the segregated ring continuously varies from the periphery to the center and is very sensitive to both the size (from 1 to 33) and density (from 0. 36 to 4. 8) ratios. The densest large beads segregate on a circle close to the center, the lightest large beads on a circle close to the periphery. Consequently, we found that for any tracer, its excess of mass, due to only a size excess, a density excess, or both, leads to a deep inside segregation of the tracer. There is a push-away process that makes heavy beads of any type go downwards, while the excess of size is already known to push large beads towards the surface, by a dynamical sieving process. Each segregation at an intermediate ring corresponds to a balance between these mass and geometrical effects. The segregation level in the flow is determined by the ratio of the intensities of both effects. Comment: submitted to Physical Review E (february 2004...|$|E
