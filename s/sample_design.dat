In survey sampling, weights {{can be applied to}} the data to adjust for the <b>sample</b> <b>design,</b> particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.|$|E
25|$|More generally, data should {{usually be}} {{weighted}} if the <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> {{does not give}} each individual an equal chance of being selected. For instance, when households have equal selection probabilities but one person is interviewed from within each household, this gives people from large households a smaller chance of being interviewed. This can be accounted for using survey weights. Similarly, households {{with more than one}} telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample, and weights can adjust for this.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} time when the PES results were fully {{analyzed}} in Zambia compared to previous years when they were only partially analyzed. The PES was aimed at finding the common issues to be considered for future census enumeration activities. PES was applied in every stage of <b>sample</b> <b>design,</b> enumeration, matching, reconciliation and the application of Dual System Estimation methodology. The major recommendations from PES were to have a pilot PES, have effective <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> and data collection of PES, match data between PES and actual enumeration by having correct names of respondents, computerize matching and include cell phone and telephone number of the respondents. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The estimated under count was 9.5 per cent [...] of the total population in rural areas and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.|$|E
