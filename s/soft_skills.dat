40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to describe the profile of <b>soft</b> <b>skill</b> teaching model in the economic and business vocational school (SMK) especially in productive subject that appropriate with industry needs. This was an qualitative research with the ethnographic approach. The data collection methods were interview, observation, documentation, and closed questionnaire. The source persons were vocational principals in Surakarta and CEO of some industries in Surakarta. The data analysis conducted by using the interactive pattern of analysis components. The research indicated that vocational schools in Surakarta needed to develop network among schools. However, while the private vocational school only had local network, the state vocational schools had wider network such as having collaboration with industry from Japan, Korea, and some countries from the Southeast Asia. The collaboration with the industry must cover the curriculum needs that had been adopted by the vocational school. The curriculum must include hard <b>skill</b> and <b>soft</b> <b>skill.</b> Hard skill must consist of knowledge (25 %) and skill (35 %). Whereas <b>soft</b> <b>skill</b> consist of character (24 %) and physical condition (16 %). There are two conclusion of this study. Firstly, the <b>soft</b> <b>skill</b> teaching in state vocational school had already integrated with teaching and learning activity. While, secondly, in the private vocational school still disintegrated with teaching and learning activity.

5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>skills</b> are {{a cluster}} of {{productive}} personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a milieu. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains <b>soft</b> <b>skills</b> as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes. National Business Education Association deems <b>soft</b> <b>skills</b> as critical for being industrious in today’s workplace. <b>Soft</b> <b>skills</b> complement hard skills also known as technical skills, for productive workplace performance and everyday life competencies (Arkansas Department of Education, 2007). Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from educational background, work experience or through interview. In the 20th century <b>soft</b> <b>skills</b> are a major differentiator, a sine qua non for employability and success in life. A study conducted by Harvard University noted that 80% of achievements in career are determined by <b>soft</b> <b>skills</b> and only 20% by hard skills. Experts say <b>soft</b> <b>skills</b> training should begin for a person when they are students, to perform efficiently in their academic environment {{as well as in}} their future workplace.

This {{research was}} an action research (Kemmis model), and it was conducted in three cycles. Each cycle consists of several meetings, and each meeting was done by some steps: planning, action, observation, and reflection. The subjects of this research were 20 male students of Grade X.

Field notes were used to describe about all the condition and situation of the class in each cycle. The results of this research show that the implementation of cooperative learning (jigsaw type) is able to develop students’ <b>soft</b> <b>skill</b> in each cycle, such as students’ responsibility to themselves and to the group, improving students’ discipline, initiating students’ creativity, and also increasing students’ communication skill so that they become more active in class either with their friends or teacher.

40|$|Main {{emphasis}} of engineering {{education in the}} pre 80 ’s {{had been in the}} science and engineering fundamentals with problem solving capability. Any acquisition of <b>softer</b> <b>skills</b> such as team work, communications skills were incidental. However, after a comprehensive review and the publication of "Change the Culture: Engineering Education into the Future", the accreditation requirement of Engineers Australia (EA) has placed emphasis on not only the technical skills but also on the <b>softer</b> <b>skills.</b> Since then, most engineering schools in Australia have incorporated the development of <b>softer</b> <b>skills</b> as part of the engineering curriculum. Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is no exception and has committed to the integration of <b>softer</b> <b>skills</b> into the overall graduate capabilities. QUT has listed seven graduate capabilities to be incorporated in every course (Bachelor of Engineering). Communication and collaborative working are among these seven capabilities. One of the EA accredited courses within Engineering at QUT is Infomechatronics which integrates mechanical, electrical and information technology areas. One of the units that include communication skills and teamwork as part of the content is Mechatronics Systems Design. This unit uses an extended laboratory as a means to facilitate teamwork and communication skills. An extended laboratory is where the students as a team will spend about 5 to 6 weeks to complete the nominated task. To enhance these <b>softer</b> <b>skills</b> the students use a web based facility called ‘TeamWorker’ developed at QUT. This paper describes the extended laboratory project and how it is being used for the enhancement of the communication and teamwork skills through TeamWorker. Results of students’ activities within the Teamworker as well as students’ response to the unit as a whole and in particular team skills {{over the past three years}} indicate that the students have become more aware of their own strengths and weaknesses in working in teams.
