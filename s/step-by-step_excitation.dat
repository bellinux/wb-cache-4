40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with quadrupole transitions in alkaline-earth atoms of calcium and strontium. The experimental values received for the quadrupole transitions probability are by 3 orders greater than theoretical values that requires new theoreticalmodels to descibe quadripole transitions. For the first time <b>step-by-step</b> <b>excitation</b> spectra have been received, probabilities of quadrupole transitions in the <b>step-by-step</b> <b>excitation</b> circuit have been measured. A method of the step-by-step ionizing spectroscopy with using of the Glan prism to increase sensitivity can be introduced in laboratory practice. The fields of application are as follows: analytical spectroscopy, laser separation of isotopesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} multi-plateau {{high-order}} harmonic generation (HHG) from solids numerically. It is {{found that the}} HHG spectrum in the second or higher plateau is redshifted in short laser pulses due to the nonadiabatic effect. The corresponding FWHMs also increase, suggesting the <b>step-by-step</b> <b>excitation</b> process of higher conduction bands in the HHG process. Even order harmonics in the higher plateaus of HHG are present due to the break of symmetry in the k space. It may stimulate related experimental work...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{more natural}} model {{is used for}} {{simulating}} the energy transfer processes in phycobilisomes from cyanobacteria. In the model, the crystal structure data of C-phycocyanins are applied and the linker polypeptides {{are taken into account}} to calculate Förster transfer rates between neighboring disks. Applying computer simulation, the single-step dynamic nature and the <b>step-by-step</b> paths for <b>excitation</b> transfer are investigated. The time constant and mean number of transfer events through a single-step provide a quantitative description of not only the dynamic property of each step but also the dominant pathways in phycobilisomes of blue-green algae. It is estimated that about 90 % of the excitation energy is transferred to the core through β 84 chromophores. The simulation also shows that the excitation energy is transferred in a natural phycobilisome most likely in partially reversible manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} conformation of a bisbinaphthyldurene (BBD) molecule is manipulated using a low-temperature ultrahigh-vacuum {{scanning tunneling microscope}} (LT-UHV STM) on an Au(111) surface. BBD has two binaphthyl {{groups at}} both ends connected to a central durene leading to anti/syn/flat conformers. In solution, dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance indicated the fast interexchange between the anti and syn conformers as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. After deposition in a submonolayer on an Au(111) surface, only the syn conformers were observed forming small islands of self-assembled syn dimers. The syn dimers can be separated into syn monomers by STM molecular manipulations. A flat conformer can also be prepared by using a peculiar mechanical unfolding of a syn monomer by STM manipulations. The experimental STM dI/dV and theoretical elastic scattering quantum chemistry maps of the low-lying tunneling resonances confirmed the flat conformer BBD molecule STM production. The key BBD electronic states for a <b>step-by-step</b> STM inelastic <b>excitation</b> lateral motion on the Au(111) are presented requiring no mechanical interactions between the STM tip apex and the BBD. On the BBD molecular board, selected STM tip apex positions for this inelastic tunneling excitation enable the flat BBD to move controllably on Au(111) by a step of 0. 29 nm per bias voltage ramp...|$|R
