40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the risk {{management}} of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are non-maturing accounts bearing a relatively attractive rate of return and two embedded options: a customer's option to withdraw money {{at any time and}} a bank's option to set the deposit as it wishes. The risk management of <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> remains a big challenge for banks and simultaneously raises serious concerns by some regulators. In this paper, we focus on the interest rate risk management of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> By constructing the replicating portfolio and simulating six scenarios for the market rate and client rates, we show that under the severest scenario, some banks in the Czech Republic might face a capital shortage up to 22 % in next two years if market rates start to increase dramatically. We conclude that <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are risky instruments that cannot be hedged by standard risk mitigation techniques. Since <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> in the Czech Republic are not subject to any special regulation yet, we propose imposing stricter regulation and supervision (the Belgium framework might be an inspiring model to consider) ...|$|R
5|$|Utilities {{and other}} {{services}} also have significantly changed since 1990. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was renovated and expanded in 1976, 1985, 1995, and 2000. In 2009, the hospital opened a new heart care center during its latest expansion. Bassett Army Hospital on Fort Wainwright went through a $132 million renovation in 2005. To meet the demand for a convention center and large sporting arena, the city paid for construction of the Carlson Center, a 5,000-seat arena that opened in 1990. In 1996, the city of Fairbanks privatized its utilities when the Municipal Utilities Service was sold to a private company. About $74 million from the sale was deposited into a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> called the Fairbanks Permanent Fund, which was invested and managed in a fashion similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, though residents do not receive any income from the Fairbanks Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and what they should be used for.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to study the}} effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate economy. I incorporate tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in a theoretical model of household 2 ̆ 7 s life-cycle decisions, which is then linked to the real world data by calibration. I {{study the effects of}} tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate savings and the aggregate output, and further analyze their impacts of different policy changes. In the first chapter, I present the important features of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in the U. S. and their institutional changes over time. I highlight the differences between IRA and 401 (k) on their contribution limits and household 2 ̆ 7 s eligibility. While IRA has a lower contribution limit and is available to all households, 401 (k) has a much higher contribution limit but is only accessible by a fraction of households. In the second chapter, I present an overlapping-generations model to capture the effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in a general equilibrium framework. There are four key aspects to the model: first, households can save in both ordinary <b>saving</b> <b>account</b> and tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>account.</b> Second, there is a nonlinear progressive income tax system. Third, households are heterogeneous in their labor productivity and 401 (k) eligibility. Fourth, households decide consumption, savings and labor supply endogenously. The model is calibrated to the US economy in 2000, with the distribution of 401 (k) eligibility being an endogenous outcome that matches the data reported in Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) in 2001. In the third chapter, I study the quantitative effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate economy and investigate their policy implications. Specifically, I estimate the macroeconomic impacts of eliminating tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> from the economy. To highlight the role played by the heterogeneity of 401 (k) eligibility, I conduct a quantitative exercise that provide universal 401 (k) eligibility to all households. In these experiments, I maintain government revenue neutrality by introducing a new proportional income tax (subsidy) that has the same effects as a upward (downward) shift of all marginal tax rates in the US income tax schedule. Since the institutional settings of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> essentially provide consumption tax treatments on households retirement savings, I further explore the implications of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> for a proportional consumption tax reform. Results from this study indicate that tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> have significant impacts on the aggregate economy and demonstrate that these accounts substantially reduce the impacts of a consumption tax reform...|$|R

40|$|Young people’s savings has {{received}} attention for its unique effects on educational outcomes, namely college attendance and graduation. Young people are {{three to six}} {{times more likely to}} attend and graduate from college when they have <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> of their own compared to those without <b>savings</b> <b>accounts,</b> even when considering household income and assets. Given these findings, researchers and policymakers are offering up young people’s savings as a solution for mitigating the effects of parents’ and households’ financial resources on educational outcomes. For the most part, research focuses on young people’s savings as a predictor, giving less consideration to variables that predict their savings. This distinction is relevant given the potential for selection bias in how young people come to have savings. Young people’s savings may be another manifestation of households’ financial resources, meaning that young people have <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> more often when their parents and households have greater financial resources. Along these lines, questions of interest include whether young people’s financial outcomes, and ultimately their educational outcomes, can be improved by extending access early in life to basic financial services like <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> This dissertation tests predictors of young people’s savings—including having <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> and median amount saved (± 600) —between adolescence and young adulthood using a longitudinal sample (N = 694) from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and its 2002 Child Development (CDS) and 2007 Transition into Adulthood (TA) Supplements. Propensity score weighting accounts for observed selection into groups of adolescents with and without <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> As the evidence stands, early access to savings leads to improved financial outcomes. Results indicate that young adults are almost two-and-a-half {{times more likely to have}} <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> and almost two times more likely to have savings above the median when they have <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> as adolescents. Young adults are more likely to have <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> and more money saved when their heads of households have more education and prestigious occupations, and parents have savings on adolescents’ behalf (e. g., 529 savings plans, Roth IRAs). Policy innovations that extend access to <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> may be a novel way to improve young people’s outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the risk {{management}} of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are non- maturing liabilities bearing two embedded options. The first option is the client's right to withdraw deposits on notice. The second option is a bank's right to change the deposit rate on <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> whenever it wishes. This in practice means that a fierce competition may arise as banks can quickly react to competitor's change in the deposit rate. The embedded characteristics make the risk management of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> challenging. We identify five key risks of savings accounts: liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate risk), systemic risk, reputational risk, and model risk. The thesis focuses on the interest rate risk and the method of replicating portfolios, which is a standard technique of the estimation of non-maturing liabilities' interest rate risk employed by banks. Using replicating portfolio approach, we derive that <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are risky liabilities. We provide evidence that high deposit rates offered on numerous <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> in the Czech Republic have not been consistent with low market rates since January 2012, at least. We show that unsustainable deposit rates combined with competition among banks will lead to capital losses in some banks when market rates increase. JEL [...] ...|$|R
