40|$|Root rot {{severely}} constrains bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{production in}} parts of Western Kenya. Genetic and soil management options were evaluated for an integrated root rot management approach. Four hundred genotypes were progressively screened {{in the field for}} resistance to root not over six seasons. A sequence of problem-solving trials on cultural methods was conducted over four seasons. All trials were conducted in root rot infested fields of farmers. No resistant varieties were found in the Kenyan germplasm collection of 374 accessions. Ten resistant varieties were identified from 26 introductions which were known to be resistant to root rots in Rwanda. Farmers preferred MLB- 49 - 89 a because of its early maturity, SCAM 80 -CM/ 5 and RWR 532 because of their high yield and seed type, and the late maturing RWR 719 as it was seen as a replacement for a previously popular cultivar which succumbed to root rots. Crop tolerance to root rots was greatly improved by improving soil fertility through application of diammonium phosphate or certain organic manures, and less so by <b>sowing</b> <b>on</b> <b>ridges.</b> Application of several rapidly decomposing green manures, including Tithonia diversifolia which was abundantly available in field borders, resulted in improved crop tolerance to root rot.

The four different farms v/z Muhammad Ismail Sehto, Noor Muhammad Sehto (Village Hakim Ali Khatian), Abdul Karim Khaskheli (Village Moosa Khatian) and Ghulam Serwar Sheikh (Village Shaman Ali Sheikh) were surveyed. The okra crop was <b>sown</b> <b>on</b> <b>ridge</b> and drill method under natural conditions. All the practices were followed by the farmers, from sowing to harvesting. The farmers were interviewed and data was collected on pesticides application, dose and time of usage by farmer. The insect pests’ infestation, occurrence of natural enemies, production and crop life duration were studied. The results regarding irrational {{use of pesticides}} in okra crop reveals that the farmers are applying pesticide on their own, without consulting/suggestions of Agriculture Experts. The farmers applied pesticide in single and in mixture with micronutrients and repeat on weakly basis, but no pest populations observed under control while the populations of natural enemies were found decreased. The yield of okra crop was also not improved due to huge application of pesticides. The crop comes in stress, pollination of flower affected and crop life reduced. The farmers are advised for proper pest scouting before any pesticide spray. If pests found at ETL then selected pesticide may be applies to control the target pests.

40|$|Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is a crop {{of great}} antiquity and {{probably}} one of the oldest oilseeds under cultivation. No records on sesame outdate those of Babylon in Sumeria where it was known in 2350 B. C. At present the crop is grown in many tropical and subtropical countries, among which India, China, Mexico, the Sudan and Venezuela rank first in production. Since 1967 most published research has been carried out in India and Venezuela. The total world production which varies considorably from year to year, has shown since 1950 / 1951 no consistent trend of increase or decrease. It amounted to about 1. 8 million ton both in 1950 / 1951 and 1969 / 1970. Approximately 10 per cent of the production moves into international trade. In Nigeria purchases of sesame seed by the Marketing Board arrived at 17, 459 ton in 1969 / 1970 and 5, 714 ton in 1970 / 1971. The export is mainly directed towards Italy. Sesame seed contains about 50 Per cent oil and 20 per cent protein, it is a popular constituent of various local dishes and is highly regarded because of the good quality of its oil. The crop is well established in parts of four province- of the Northern States of Nigeria. The production areas are characterised by their location between latitudes 6 ° and 10 °, a duration of the dry season of about 4 to 5 months, an annual rainfall of about 1, 000 - 1, 500 mm, a vegetation of rather open savannah woodland and a top soil of loamy sand. The cultivation and crop handling follow traditional patterns and the use of machinery is uncommon. Most of the experimental work reported here has been carried out at the Agricultural Research Station, Mokwa, Nigeria. Section 4 deals with spacing and density experiments. Ways of sowing vary in the different production areas of Nigeria but basically two methods can be distinguished. (a) The Igbirra method, characterised by <b>sowing</b> <b>on</b> <b>ridges</b> about 4 m apart at a spacing of 45 cm between the stands and with about 16 plants per stand, and (b) the Tiv method, which involves broadcasting,rarely followed by thinning; plant counts per unit area showed considerable variation, the mean plant density value being calculated as 673, 000 plants per ha. In view of soil and water conservation, <b>sowing</b> <b>on</b> <b>ridges</b> has been a recommended practice in Nigeria for a long time, the distance between the ridges usually being 91 cm. The experimental results under such conditions were interpreted as to give an optimum for a spacing of about 6 cm. on the ridges. Sowing on the flat in 1971 produced a maximum-yield at a spacing of about 22 x 13 cm. In this case a formula derived from Bleasdale and Nelder (1960) was found to describe well the relation between spacing and yield. In both methods, described under (a) and (b) there is room for improvement. In Nigeria. it is common experience that for a good number of crops early sowing, immediately after the onset of the rains, results in maximum yields and delay of sowing causes yield reduction. Factors thought to affect sowing date differences and their consequences for crop growth and yield, were, daylength changes, leaching of nitrogen, capping of the soil caused by hard rain, saturation of the soil with water, and differences in light intensity, disease and post incidence and temperature during the growing season. The data in section 5 provide a quantitative evaluation of the effect of sowing date on growth and yield of sesame. They indicate that the first four factors mentioned cannot explain the typical "sowing date delay effect. " However, changes in light intensity, disease incidence and possibly temperature during the season influence the relation between sowing date and crop growth. Most of the common sesame cultivars are characterised by opening or dehiscent capsules. This capsule character has the advantage that it simplifies threshing, but the disadvantage that it increases seed loss. The discovery in 1943 of the indehiscence character in Venezuela by Langham was of great significance, as it enabled increased mechanisation of sesame production, and was expected to reduce seed loss. However, the results of experiments described in section 6 showed that losses caused by shattering of seed from opening capsules is less than visually estimated, and that seed loss need not exceed 2 per cent if a good harvesting method is applied (Fence B). It is concluded that the character of indehiscent capsules will become of value only when combines can be employed economically at harvest. Picking or stripping of capsules appeared to be a method of no practical value. Section 7 mentions the main diseases and pests of sesame and deals in more detail with a virus, disease called leaf-curl. Attempts to transmit the disease with plant sap and with seed failed but white flies were observed to act as vectors of leaf-curl. The damage caused by the disease can be disastrous and it embodies an actual or potential threat to sesame cultivation in Nigeria. Sowing date trials showed that delay of sowing after the onset of the rains increases infection and that the disease incidence decreases when sowing is postponed till after the middle of July. Sowing after the middle of August results in disease-free crops. The magnitude of the white fly population, as estimated by counts on yellow, sticky traps, was not always a reliable indicator for the extent of disease infection. Resistance to leaf-curl was correlated with hairiness in an F 4 bulk population, but occurred also in glabrous plants and reduced the disease damage considerably. ...|$|E
40|$|Mr. Seydou Kone, a 44 year-old sorghum farmer {{from the}} village of Garasso in Sikasso region is a hard worker and {{dedicated}} farmer. However, in his field, yields of the local sorghum variety have never exceeded 1. 2 metric tons per hectare. In 2008, when he heard about the increased productivity made possible by the adoption of a new sorghum hybrid variety “Grinkan”, he saw, as many other producers in Garasso, a great opportunity to improve his sorghum productivity. Through the technical assistance provided by the NGO AMEDD, Mr Seydou Kone remarkably improved his technical skills regarding sorghum production. First and foremost, land preparation is an essential first step in his crop management. He uses water harvesting techniques to increase the soil moisture and improve the response of the sorghum cultivar to the use of inorganic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer is used during land preparation and the seeds are <b>sowed</b> <b>on</b> <b>ridges.</b> The use of inorganic fertilizer in the form of Di-Ammonium Phosphate and urea provides all the nutrients necessary for the plant growth. A big technical innovation is the implementation of plant thinning. Every year, this agronomic practice is performed on the basis of two plants per hole as suggested. The rigorous application of these agricultural practices has helped Mr. Kone to make impressive yield gains. Indeed, in 2009, he was the best sorghum farmer in the village and achieved a yield of 3 metric tons per hectare, almost three times what he was able to harvest under the traditional technology. Mr Kone is a model of work achievement in the village and an inspiring example for other producers willing to adopt the new sorghum technology. With the adoption of the sorghum technical innovations, his family’s household grain consumption has improved, and as it has never happened in the past, sorghum is now used as a source of cash income. The profit resulting from the sales of sorghum is evaluated at $ 708 per hectare. This income has helped Mr Kone to meet the necessary household expenditures and improve his family’s living standard through the purchase of a new means of transportation and some housing improvements...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The Matengo have {{cultivated}} {{steep slope}} fields {{for more than}} a century using their original soil conservation system. This system is a two-year rotation that includes a short-term grassland fallow. The field lies fallow without cultivation during the early rainy season at the first year. The grasses are cut down and the dry shoots are gathered up in lines forming a grid on the field that is then covered with topsoil in a square. The ridges form the grid, thereby producing many well-ordered pits over the whole field. The pit can function as a buffer and controls run-off by allowing rainwater to stand. Although the pit may break if the precipitation of an intense rain is beyond the capacity of buffer, the ridges are protected con-sistently because the water in pit can be efficiently led downward along the buried shoot bun-dles in the soil. At the beginning of the next rainy season, maize is <b>sown</b> <b>on</b> the <b>ridges.</b> Because the buried shoots are decomposed during this rainy season releasing nutrients of the maize, subsurface drainage is lost. The pit functions as a small sedimentation tank until the pit is filled with soil. Thereafter, because the field is covered with well-grown maize, the sur-face soil is again protected from runoff, thus conserving the topsoil and their fertility on steep slopes throughout a year. This area is also famous for coffee production, and the high cash income from coffee has economically sustained this farming system and the societ...|$|R
