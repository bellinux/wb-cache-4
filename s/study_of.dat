5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses on the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> fossil plants, but traditionally includes the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy is the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence.

Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E

40|$|This paper clarifies {{contents}} <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> {{education by}} teachers in colonial Korea and examines its characteristic. In {{the history of}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers 2 ̆ 7, a lot <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> in Japanese colony have been missed till now. Under the education system to follow 2 ̆ 2 mainland 2 ̆ 2 (Japan) in colonial Korea, <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers were performed for 1910 - 45 years. They were <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education performed in special environment such as a colony, but we cannot deny {{that they were a}} part <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers of 2 ̆ 2 Japan 2 ̆ 2. Therefore, it is important for elucidation <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers in modern 2 ̆ 2 Japan 2 ̆ 2 to clarify how <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers in colonial Korea were performed. Furthermore, it is a trial for finding reality of education in Japanese colony by make clear what were considered to be problems in colonial Korea, and what were objects <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers. Under the thought, this paper focused on 2 ̆ 2 Chosen syoto kyouiku kenkiyukai 2 ̆ 2 (representative organization <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers in colonial Korea) established in Keijo normal school. And in this paper, I examined the following points. 1. A characteristic of 2 ̆ 2 Chosen syoto kvouiku kenkyukai 2 ̆ 2.

(Holding <b>of</b> meetings for <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers and publication of magazines/books) As a result, provided knowledge are four points of the following. 1. <b>Studies</b> <b>of</b> education by teachers in colonial Korea were differed from 2 ̆ 2 mainland 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 one.
