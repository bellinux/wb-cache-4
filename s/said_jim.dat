According to Jackson, it {{is reminiscent of}} [...] "Together Again" [...] or [...] "Throb" [...] from The Velvet Rope (1997) and janet. (1993), respectively. [...] "It's still classic me but with a different twist to it â€“ a modern twist", she <b>said.</b> <b>Jim</b> Farber from New York Daily News noted the song's riffs, which he considered greater when they first appeared in Madonna's 1985 song [...] "Into the Groove". The song was compared to Jackson's brother Michael Jackson's [...] "Rock with You" [...] (1979), due to its disco themes. [...] "Rock with U" [...] also contains vocodered whispers and murmured vocals. The song opens with the line, [...] "Strobe lights make everything sexier," [...] while it talks about an erotic proposition which was reportedly dedicated to the gay community.|$|E

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} Muncie [...] "was gifted with size, speed and power", while The Miami News said he possessed the {{strength}} of a fullback and the elegance of a halfback. U-T San Diego added that he was [...] "widely considered the most talented running back of his era", and the San Francisco Chronicle said Muncie [...] "could have been the greatest running back in NFL history, a 2.0 version of Jim Brown" [...] if he had the discipline of running backs like Walter Payton or Roger Craig. [...] "His head is the only thing holding him back", <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> Brown. [...] "If he had total dedication, he could achieve any goal." [...] While he was in New Orleans, he frequently slept through meetings whenever he attended them at all. Whenever the Saints broke the huddle, quarterback Archie Manning had to walk by Muncie and tell him exactly what he was supposed to do in the upcoming play. Manning recalled years later that it was obvious that Muncie [...] "wasn't thinking about football" [...] during the week.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose I must go back," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jims</b> with a sigh. [...] "It {{will be our}} supper time in half an {{hour and}} Aunt Augusta will come to take me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jims.</b> He {{took her}} hand and kissed it. He had read of a young knight doing that and had always thought he would like to try it if he ever got a chance. But who could dream of kissing Aunt Augusta's hands? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim,</b> {{in a tone}} of gloomy confidence,--"how {{much did}} you reckon to make by stealin' that gal-baby, sonny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's grand,' <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> 'And it's awfully decent of you chaps to fag yourselves {{like this}} for me. I'll start on {{something}} now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now--thank the Lord; but {{you must}} lie down again and keep quiet," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim,</b> gently and kindly forcing his friend backward.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, indeed!' said Irene, {{laughing}} {{as if she}} didn't believe me. 'Morgan on the Care of Infants' was upstairs or I would soon have convinced her. Then she <b>said</b> <b>Jims</b> didn't have much hair--she {{had never seen a}} four months' old baby so bald.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Burroughs said so. I'm only quoting," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jims</b> easily. [...] "And Uncle Walter just worshipped her. And all at {{once she}} just jilted him without a word of explanation, Mr. Burroughs said. So {{that is why he}} hates women. It isn't any wonder, is it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Stone Sour (mostly used {{on their}} softer songs, or [...] "songs for the ladies" [...] as <b>said</b> by <b>Jim</b> Root).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' <b>said</b> <b>Jim,</b> {{in a tone}} which implied, 'I am no George Washington myself, {{but when}} you say he read it inadvertently, well--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't goin' to hev such {{wreckage}} as {{they pick}} up and enlist set adrift on our marshes, Mag," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> decidedly.|$|E
6000|$|Vine's hat was thrust {{back into}} his poll. His face was pale, and his manner bewildered. 'Hullo? what's the matter?' <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> 'Where's my Margery?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hope it didn't want an answer,' he <b>said</b> to <b>Jim</b> after school. 'Constant {{practice}} has made Thompson {{a sort of}} amateur lynx.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, you know," [...] <b>said</b> Captain <b>Jim</b> solemnly, [...] "the Royal William {{came into}} Four Winds Harbor at {{daylight}} the next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Cornelia," [...] <b>said</b> Captain <b>Jim</b> gravely, [...] "I've {{often thought}} that if I wasn't a Presbyterian I'd be a Methodist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless me,' <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> to her, on {{entering}} the sitting-room; 'I quite forgot {{to get a}} light beforehand; but I'll have one in a jiffy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a far {{cry from}} here to the Lawrence Hall,' <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> 'Better turn in early, Scott. It's paddy-carts to-morrow; you'll begin loading at five.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} it's old Neptune himself," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> Freeman, {{another of the}} [...] "hands." [...] "There's his head; an' {{something}} like his pitchfork." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I got to land, you Fool," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Jim,</b> {{with a sort}} of despairing wrathfulness, and began moving down-stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Gaw!" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Jim,</b> going {{backward}} helplessly, and Mr. Polly thrust {{hard and}} abandoned the broom to the enemy's despairing clutch.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whuff!' <b>said</b> Old <b>Jim,</b> {{to show he}} was ready, {{and struck}} across a long rolling stretch of turf. Presently he asked for his beefbone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{sometimes}} difficult," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> [...] "As a rule, gold is pure. It doesn't form chemical alloys, but it's often {{mixed with}} other substances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucky {{that we made}} up the parcels last night, warn't it?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> Slagg as {{they made}} hasty {{arrangements}} for carrying out their plan.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now a {{man might}} think so, my baron,' <b>said</b> <b>Jim,</b> getting more confidential. 'But the real truth is, 'tis {{the hardest part of}} all for me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Jim,</b> as he hurriedly slurred {{over the}} French {{substantive}} at the close, [...] "did ye ever see such God-forsaken foolishness?" ...|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Although Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} cheese puffs scene was [...] "one {{of the most}} awesome cold opens in recent memory", he also said [...] "Heavy Competition" [...] was [...] "one of the weakest episodes of the Idris Elba cycle". Rabin also <b>said</b> <b>Jim's</b> {{treatment}} of Andy was mean-spirited and unfunny: [...] "Jim tried to spin it into a character-building lesson for Andy but it left a bad taste all the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'One minute,' <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Jim,</b> who was thinking. 'If {{he goes to}} Khanda, {{he passes}} within five miles of us. Of course he'll ride in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{they have}} no games worth playing at," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> [...] "They can neither throw nor leap. I don't wonder at Mary's not liking it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a clear case of bolt," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim.</b> [...] "He's skipped, or my name's not Pinkerton. He's gone to head us off at Midway Island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jim</b> Crow, gruffly, [...] "what's {{the matter}} with you fellows? Haven't you got tongues? You seemed to talk fast enough a minute ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} about you," [...] said the thrush, boldly; [...] "and you wouldn't care at all {{to know what we}} <b>said,</b> Mister <b>Jim</b> Crow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "World {{coming to}} pieces bit by bit," [...] <b>said</b> Lilly. <b>Jim</b> was {{twisting}} in his chair, and {{looking like a}} Chinese dragon, diabolical. The room was uneasy.|$|R
6000|$|... "If only you'd {{told me she}} had died," [...] he <b>said</b> to <b>Jim,</b> [...] "I'd {{have been}} man enough to stand it, but--this--this kills me--I can't breathe!" ...|$|R
