50|$|Although {{the term}} {{insulator}} implies low electrical conduction, dielectric typically means materials {{with a high}} polarizability. The latter is expressed by a number called the relative permittivity (also known in older texts as dielectric constant). The term insulator is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while the term dielectric is used to indicate the energy <b>storing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the material (by means of polarization). A common example of a dielectric is the electrically insulating material between the metallic plates of a capacitor. The polarization of the dielectric by the applied electric field increases the capacitor's surface charge for the given electric field strength.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of new holographic memories based in photopolymers have a great goal. A new commercial holographic memories has been optimized by Aprilis and Inphase. The advantages of this type of materials to store information are well know: their high capacity and their fast random access. In the behaviour of this type of material two important factors determinate the quality of the material, the capacity and the energetic sensitivity. The base of the high capacity of the holographic memories is the high Bragg’s angular selectivity. The narrow curve of the angular scan are obtained when the effective optical thickness of material is high and permits record many holograms turning the plate only 3 °. Others important factors are the dye and monomer concentration, high values of the concentrations origins high values of the index modulation (higher <b>stored</b> <b>capacity,</b> better energetic sensitivity and large dynamic range) but in when the dye and monomer concentrations are high all the light is absorbed in the first 200 μm of the material and the effective optical thickness of the grating recorded decrease (decrease the <b>stored</b> <b>capacity)</b> and the values of the noise are high in this case. In this work this attenuation of the index modulation in depth is having into account using rigorous couple wave theory to obtain the limit of the effective optical thickness for each composition of photopolymer. The optimal composition to obtain high <b>stored</b> <b>capacity,</b> high index modulation, good energetic sensitivity, high dynamic range and low noise are found.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to develop an {{estimation}} method based on available soil map information (categorical data) and thereafter estimate and map across Europe the soil filtering and <b>storing</b> <b>capacity</b> of different substances, which support ecosystem services and those which present a hazard to the ecosystem functioning. Pollutants were grouped as follows: (1) elements in cationic form; (2) elements in anionic form; (3) solids and pathogenic microorganisms; (4) non-polar organic chemicals and (5) nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). The spatial pattern of areas with high soil <b>storing</b> <b>capacity</b> are largely different depending on the stored substances. In general, those soils are characterized by good storing capability that have thick topsoil and subsoil layers and these layers are free from the effects of groundwater. As the content of clay and humus content increases and the stone or gravel content decreases, the storage capacity increases simultaneously. However, the effect of soil pH and the soil mineralogy is different depending on the various groups of pollutants (e. g. the calcareous soils with high swelling clay mineral content are able to bind more cations, whereas the acidic soils or the soils with high sesquioxide content have higher anion <b>storing</b> <b>capacity).</b> The soil filtering capacity pattern of Europe in the case of different groups of substances are in part similar to the <b>storing</b> <b>capacity</b> pattern.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{release of}} fission gas during temperature transients (burst release) can be critical during operational reactor transients and (design-basis) accidents. A purely diffusion-based model cannot explain the rapid kinetics of the process. In this work, {{we present a}} model for transient fission gas release in oxide fuel. This model arises from experimental observations relative to both in-reactor irradiation and post-irradiation annealing of UO 2 fuel. In particular, micrographs demonstrate the presence of grain-face separations (micro-cracks) in transient-tested fuel, thus indicating that a basic mechanism of burst release is micro-cracking. The presented model extends a previously developed diffusion-based model, introducing the effect of micro-cracking. This is interpreted as a reduction of the grain-face gas inventory and <b>storing</b> <b>capacity</b> during transients. The process is modelled through an empirical temperature-dependent function based on the experimentally observed characteristics of gas release during both heating and cooling transients. The model also includes an irradiation-induced micro-crack healing process, which gradually restores the original grain-face gas <b>storing</b> <b>capacity.</b> This process is described {{by means of an}} empirical burnup-dependent function. The resulting extended model (diffusion-based fission gas behaviour together with transient release) is overall semi-empirical, but the burst release capability notably preserves the continuity in time and space as well as the consistent coupling of the calculated fission gas release and swelling. The new model was originally implemented in the fuel performance code BISON. In this work, we implemented the model in the TRANSURANUS fuel performance code, and applied it to the simulation of some light water reactors fuel rod irradiation experiments of the OECD/NEA International Fuel Performance Experiments database. The results point out a representation of the kinetics of burst release consistent with experimental evidence...|$|E

Our results suggest that only pure water can penetrate the pores, the ions being quartered in the bulk liquid around nanoporous medium. This selectivity explains very high pressures for very concentrated ions reported by Tzanis et al (2014). Finally, a partial intrusion of NaI and LiI is observed.

In the first experiment, it was found that subjects' digit spans were not significantly related to their performances on either short-term or longterm memory tasks, or to theoretical measures of their memory <b>store</b> <b>capacities.</b> Memory for the temporal occurrence of events, however, proved to be positively correlated with digit span. A second experiment confirmed that digit span was correlated with memory for the temporal occurrence of events, but not with item memory.
