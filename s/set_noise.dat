This work is motivated by the approach taken to improve the accuracies in the Global Positioning System (GPS), through noise modeling and augmentation. Since UWB indoor position tracking is accomplished using methods {{similar to that of the}} GPS, the same two general approaches can be used to improve accuracy. Trilateration calculations are affected by errors in distance measurements from the set of fixed points to the object of interest. When these errors are systemic, each distinct set of fixed points can be said to exhibit a unique <b>set</b> <b>noise.</b> For UWB indoor position tracking, the set of fixed points is a set of sensors measuring the distance to a tracked tag.

Therefore to reduce gear noise and vibrations several techniques have been proposed in recent years. In this research the experimental work is carried out to study the effect of planet phasing on noise and subsequent resulting vibrations of Nylon- 6 planetary gear drive. For this purpose experimental set-up was built and trials were conducted for two different arrangements (i. e., with phasing and without phasing) and it is observed that the noise level and resulting vibrations were reduced by planet phasing arrangement.

While this ability for perfect interference cancellation is very appealing, it relies heavily on the Gaussianity of the (unknown) noise Z. We construct an example of “bad ” noise for writing on dirty paper, namely, “difference <b>set</b> <b>noise</b> ” (DSN). If the interference S is strong, then DSN limits the WDP capacity to at most 2 bits. At the same time, {{the capacity of the}} zero-interference channel Y = X + Z, where Z is DSN, grows without bound as the input constraint grows. Thus almost 100 % of the available capacity is lost in WDP in the presence of DSN. These results are based on the “entropy amplification property ” of DSN, and they shed light on the potentials and limitations of writing on dirty paper. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Physical-layer-based {{security}} aims at {{ensuring the}} reliability of communication and preventing eavesdropping {{by taking advantage of}} the physical layer’s characteristics rather than the data encryption in upper layer. Cooperation is a way to achieve this goal with many benefits for wireless communication. In particular, the cooperation scheme called decode-and-forward (DF) is discussed in this paper and our objective is to design the beamforming weight of each cooperating node which is one antenna equipped for maximum achievable secrecy rate. Considering that individual power constraint is more reasonable than total power constraint and to <b>set</b> <b>noise</b> power levels at the destination and the eavesdropper different is more practical than the same, we get the whole optimization problem which is unconvex. With the help of perfect global channel state information (CSI), the problem is solved through a way where convex optimization and one-dimensional search are combined together. And strict proofs are presented for this method. Then zero-forcing (ZF) based simplification and extension to cope with multi-antenna case are discussed. Numerical results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the security performance of wireless systems. Index Terms—physical layer security, maximum achievabl...|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of functional brain images is often {{hampered by the}} presence of noise. This problem is most commonly solved by using a statistical method and only considering signals that are unlikely to occur by chance. The method used should be specific and sensitive, specific because only true signals are of interest and sensitive because this will enable more information to be extracted from each experiment. Here we present a modification of the cluster analysis proposed by Roland et al. (Human Brain Mapping 1 : 3 – 19, 1993). A covariance model is used to test hypotheses for each voxel. The generated statistical images are searched for the largest clusters. From the same data <b>set</b> <b>noise</b> images are generated.

The goal of point set {{registration is}} to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown non-rigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point <b>set,</b> <b>noise</b> and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and non-rigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the GMM centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and non-rigid transformations {{in the presence of}} noise, outliers and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods...|$|E

This is the first plot of this type. We follow the model-independent methodology of Daly and Djorgovski (2004) used for their radio-galaxy data. Once the data plot is completed, any model can be applied and will display accordingly as described in standard literature. We then compile an extensive data set to z = 1. 8 by combining SNe Ia data from SNLS 3 of Conley et al. (2011), High-z SNe data of Riess et al. (2004) and radio-galaxy data of Daly & Djorgovski (2004) {{to be used to}} validate the new plot. We first display these data on a standard Hubble diagram to confirm the best fit for LCDM cosmology and thus validate the joined data set. The scale factor plot is then developed from the data and the LCDM model is again displayed from a least-squares fit. The fit parameters are in agreement with the Hubble diagram fit confirming the validity of the new plot.

40|$|This study {{examined}} hormonal responses to competition {{in relation to}} gender, social context, and implicit motives. Participants (N = 326) {{were randomly assigned to}} win or lose in a 10 -round, virtual face-to-face competition, in same-sex individual- and team-competition contexts. Saliva samples, taken before and twice after the competition, were assayed for testosterone (T), estradiol (E), progesterone (P), and cortisol (C). Implicit needs for power (nPower) and affiliation (nAffiliation) were assessed with a picture-story exercise before the competition. Aggression was measured via the volume at which participants <b>set</b> <b>noise</b> blasts for their opponents. Men competing individually and women competing as teams showed similar T increases after winning. C was differentially associated with outcome in the team matches, with higher post-match cortisol for winning women, and an opposite effect for male teams. Analyses including implicit motives indicated that situational variables interacted with motivational needs in shaping hormonal responses to competition: in naturally cycling women, nPower predicted T increases after winning and T and E decreases after losing. In men, nPower predicted T increases after losing and decreases after winning. In male teams, nPower predicted C increases after losing, but not after winning, whereas in individual competitions, nPower was a general negative predictor of C changes in women. nAffiliation predicted P increases for women competing as teams, and P decreases for women competing individually. Aggression was higher in men, losers, and teams than in women, winners, and individuals. High aggression was associated with high baseline C in women competing individually and with low baseline C and C decreases in women competing as teams and in men generally. Our findings suggest that while situational and gender factors play a role in hormonal responses to competition, they also depend on their interplay with motivational factors. They also suggest that while aggression is strongly affected by situational factors {{in the context of a}} competition, it has no direct association with motivational and hormonal correlates of dominance (nPower, T, E) and instead is associated with (mostly) low levels of C...|$|E

Speakers produced each of the 24 consonants (/b/, /d/, /g/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/, //, /f/, /v/, //, //, /t/, /z/, //, /h/, /d/, /m/, /n/, //, /w/, //, /y/, /l/) in nine vowel contexts consisting of all possible combinations of the three vowels /i:/ (as in “beat”), /u:/ (as in “boot”), and /ae/ (as in “bat”). Each VCV was produced using both front and back stress (e. g. ‘aba vs ab’a) giving a total of 24 (speakers) * 24 (consonants) * 2 (stress types) * 9 (vowel contexts) = 10368 tokens. Pilot listening tests were carried out to identify unusable tokens due to poor pronunciations or other problems. See the Technical details page for further details of the collection and post-processing procedure. Training, development and test sets Training material comes from 8 male and 8 female speakers while tokens from the remaining 8 speakers {{are used in the}} independent test set. A development set will be released shortly. After removing unusable tokens identified during post-processing, the training set consists of 6664 clean tokens. Seven tests sets, corresponding to a quiet and 6 noise conditions, are available. Each test set contains 16 instances of each of the 24 consonants, for a total of 384 tokens. Listeners will identify consonants in each of the test conditions. Minimally, each contribution to the special session should report results on {{some or all of the}} test sets. Scoring software will be released in February 2008.

Signal-to-noise ratios were determined using pilot tests with listeners with the goal of producing similar identification scores (~ 65 - 70 %) in each noise condition. VCV tokens are additively embedded in noise samples of duration 1. 2 s. The SNR is computed token-wise and refers to the SNR in the section where the speech and noise overlap.

In addition, test materials are also available as “stereo” sound files which are identical to the test sets except that the the noise and VCV tokens are in separate channels. We have made the test material available in this form to support computational models of human consonant perception which may wish to make some assumptions about e. g. ideal noise processing, and also to allow for the computation of idealised engineering systems (e. g. to determine performance ceilings).
