Using software ANSYS, The 3 -D finite element models of single tower, one tower and two <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> conductor <b>wires,</b> three towers and four <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> conductor <b>wires,</b> five towers and six <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> conductor <b>wires</b> were established separately, which were based on Qixia ∼ Wendeng (Kunyu) 500 kV transmission line project. Time histories of wind speed acting on transmission tower-line system were simulated with AR method using software Matlab. The displacement of middle towers in every model were caculated and analyzed. This paper discusses {{the effect of the}} tower-line interaction on the transmission tower-line system and derives some useful results, which is useful for the future research...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, service {{providers}} use the intermediate frequency ranges of 950-2150 MHz {{to carry the}} signal from the LNBF at the dish down to the receiver. This allows for transmission of UHF signals along the same <b>span</b> <b>of</b> coaxial <b>wire</b> at the same time. In some applications (DirecTV AU9-S and AT-9), ranges of the lower B-band and 2250-3000 MHz, are used. Newer LNBFs in use by DirecTV, called SWM (Single Wire Multiswitch), are used to implement single cable distribution and use a wider frequency range of 2-2150 MHz.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} nonexpensive adapted {{dip-coating}} technique is presented {{and used to}} fabricate arrays of magnetic nanowires with a linear varying height profile. This approach allows controlling the wire height from tenths of nanometers up to several micrometers. Furthermore, the main parameters of this height gradient can be controlled, such as the maximum wire height and the lateral <b>span</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> array, which can be predicted with excellent accuracy using a proposed analytical model. Moreover, we show that by sequential electrodeposition with dip-coating, arrays of these height varying wires can be grown. This technique represents a novel method to fill porous templates with controlled spatial growth, leading to the fabrication of novel structures and providing control over structural features on the nanoscale level. In particular, {{the use of these}} asymmetrically loaded magnetic nanowired substrates to obtain improved microwave nonreciprocal behavior is shown for a microwave phase shifter...|$|R

An innovative and inexpensive method to reproduce wet snow accretions on a cable in a controlled environment is explained. Wet snow sleeves were experimentally reproduced by using this technique to study their shedding mechanism. A numerical modeling technique using nonlinear finite element analysis is proposed to evaluate the dynamic response of an overhead cable subjected to any snow-shedding scenario. A time function is associated to the mass and weight of each snow element, which enables its virtual removal from the model at the time prescribed by the user.

It {{has been reported that}} a flexural Young’s modulus of ~ 133 – 184  GPa for as-received SS archwires was measured by a three-point flexural test [13], while 468 – 526  GPa of Young’s modulus on SS wires was measured in this study by a four-point bending test, which was about threefold of the former. The explanation for the differences could be the support span. A support <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 20  mm was used in this research (Fig.  5), while other researchers used a lower support <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 14 and 9  mm [14, 20].

In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R

METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
