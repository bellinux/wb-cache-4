5|$|Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, {{because of}} Ruisdael's {{depiction}} of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael {{was buried in the}} Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.|$|E

The historical costume drama, the western and the war film had filled Fox's production schedule and this all-black musical drama based on an established and popular opera would <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> a box-office success, as proved true. Carmen Jones was released in October 1954, exactly one year and one month after Fox's first CinemaScope venture, the Biblical epic The Robe, had opened in theatres.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E
25|$|On {{hearing this}} Duryodhana closed all the fingers and rested. Duryodhana {{concluded}} that these 3 factors should have surely brought him victory. Had {{he built a}} fort around Hastinapur, he could have totally avoided {{the war in the}} first place. If Vidura had fought on his side, he would have had the best strategist, even better than Krishna. At last, Duryodhana {{came to the conclusion that}} Krishna was in fact the avatar of Lord Vishnu. If Duryodhana had named Ashwatthama the commander of the army after the death of Drona, victory would have <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> his as Ashwatthama was the avatar of Lord Shiva. No one can handle a 'furious' Ashwatthama, the part incarnate of Lord Shiva. All Duryodhana need to do to win the war was to make Ashwatthama furious. The remorse about under-utilizing Ashwatthama prompted Duryodhana to rethink and make Ashwatthama the commander of his army after the war, after his defeat. These events led to the complete destruction of the Pandavas' army. After the night raid of Ashwatthama on the Pandava camp, Duryodhana felt like he had won the war, as the Pandavas lost everything and everyone they cared about.|$|E

500|$|Justin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow [...] "a cleverly crafted and propulsively {{executed}} sci-fi thriller", {{saying that}} the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, {{with the assistance of}} the editors, [...] "tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said [...] "Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole." [...] He also commended the visual effects of the [...] "expertly designed Mimics" [...] as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.|$|E

He finished his review on a hopeful note, eyeing the still undeveloped spaces available in the civic centre building for further expansion. [...] He concluded that it would be [...] "a real shame if the project were to falter at this stage", and that further phases of expansion [...] "must <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> good for the city and its future success." ...|$|E

500|$|For much of 1948 Jacques {{continued}} to record episodes of ITMA {{for half the}} week, while spending evenings in the Players' Theatre; she also found time during the spring to record the role of Flora in No, No, Nanette for the BBC and appear at the Whitehall Theatre in Bates Wharf with the Under Thirty Theatre Group. Later that year she appeared as a singer at the Three Cripples tavern in the David Lean film Oliver Twist. In September she started recording her second series of ITMA—the show's twelfth—before returning to the Players' for the Christmas pantomime, The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood. In the latter performance, The Times commented that Jacques [...] "must <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> among the funniest fairies" [...] {{in her role as}} the Fairy Queen Antedota—which was one of her favourite parts.|$|E
500|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} (Pitohui dichrous) was {{described}} by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. Bonaparte placed it in the genus Rectes which had been erected {{in the same year}} by Ludwig Reichenbach as an alternative name for the genus Pitohui, which had been described by René Lesson in 1831. No explanation was given for the preference of the newer name over the established older one, but it was common to prefer Latin names over non-Latin names, and to provide Latin names to those without. Richard Bowdler Sharpe encapsulated that attitude when he wrote in 1903 [...] "Pitohui is doubtless an older name than Rectes, but can <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> laid aside as a barbarous word". Eventually however the principle of priority, which favours the first formal name given to a taxon, was applied, and Rectes was suppressed as the junior synonym of Pitohui.|$|E
500|$|Voltaire {{actively}} rejected Leibnizian optimism {{after the}} natural disaster, {{convinced that if}} this were the best possible world, it should <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> better than it is. In both Candide and Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne ("Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both Candide and his Poème to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe {{as one of the most}} horrible disasters [...] "in the best of all possible worlds". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and Candide, has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne by Ange Goudar.|$|E
