5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in a properly functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, <b>seatpost,</b> or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
25|$|The {{wheel is}} usually {{similar to a}} bicycle wheel with a special hub {{designed}} so the axle is a fixed part of the hub. This means {{the rotation of the}} cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach {{to the ends of the}} axle, and the <b>seatpost</b> slides into the frame to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|The seat [...] tube {{contains}} the <b>seatpost</b> of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the <b>seatpost</b> is inserted into the seat tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick release lever. The <b>seatpost</b> must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|E
50|$|Lengths {{range from}} 75 mm to 430 mm. Mountain bike <b>seatposts</b> {{tend to be}} longer than road bicycle <b>seatposts.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Seatposts</b> {{generally}} clamp {{directly onto}} saddle rails {{with which they}} must be compatible, while old or inexpensive <b>seatposts</b> slide into a separate clamp that then clamps the saddle rails.|$|R
50|$|Suspension <b>seatposts</b> {{allow the}} saddle {{to move up}} and down with either a {{telescoping}} or parallelogram mechanism and incorporate a spring, an elastomer, or compressed air and possibly a damper to insulate against bumps. The preload of the spring may be adjustable. These <b>seatposts</b> are most common on hybrid and mountain bikes. Suspension <b>seatposts</b> usually come in fewer diameters, and shims {{are more likely to be}} necessary.|$|R
2500|$|... seat lug or seat cluster {{joins the}} top tube and seat tube; {{the ends of}} the seat stays are usually brazed {{directly}} to the sides or back of the seat lug, although some newer designs of seatlugs also have sockets for the seat stays.

2500|$|Generally {{used for}} {{flatland}} skills and freestyle routines, freestyle unicycles typically {{have a relatively}} high <b>seatpost,</b> a narrow saddle, and a squared fork (used for one-footed tricks). These unicycles are used similarly to flatland bicycles. Wheel size is usually , but smaller riders may use [...] unicycles. Some people prefer [...] wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{size of the}} <b>seatpost</b> is {{dependent}} upon the internal dimensions of the seat tube of the bicycle frame. They come in various diameters, lengths and offsets. Offset is {{the distance between the}} centerline of the <b>seatpost</b> tube, and the centerline of the clamp area. Shims are often available to adapt a too-small <b>seatpost</b> to a too-large seat tube.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to wheels, the Zipp product range currently includes handlebars, stems, <b>seatposts,</b> tires, and bags.|$|R

The <b>seatpost</b> must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|E
50|$|A bicycle saddle is {{commonly}} {{attached to the}} <b>seatpost</b> and {{the height of the}} saddle can usually be adjusted by the <b>seatpost</b> telescoping {{in and out of the}} seat tube.|$|E
50|$|A trailer bike is {{attached}} to a bicycle at either the <b>seatpost</b> or on a special rear rack by a linkage that allows for pivoting. Alternatively, the hitch mechanism may rotate using the <b>seatpost</b> as the pivot. The attachment may include a quick-release option.|$|E
50|$|Giant frames were {{originally}} made of 6061 (ALUXX) aluminium alloy and were also characterised by bladed forks and <b>seatposts</b> to reduce air resistance. Frames came in three sizes (small, medium, and large), with riders fitted {{through the use}} of stems and <b>seatposts</b> of different lengths. Another Mike Burrows innovation that was featured on the original TCR (Total Compact Road) bikes included a height-adjustable stem, later removed from road racing bicycles due to flex under heavy loads.|$|R

50|$|SRAM {{purchased}} Truvativ in 2004, providing SRAM {{with a line}} of cranks, bottom brackets, handlebars, stems, pedals, <b>seatposts</b> {{and chain}} retention systems. This allowed SRAM to offer a complete drivetrain with the first SRAM branded road groupsets being released the following year.|$|R
5000|$|With Scott Sports {{taking more}} {{prominence}} as a naming sponsor, non-drivetrain components from Shimano subsidiary PRO such as <b>seatposts</b> and handlebars {{were replaced by}} Scott subsidiary Syncros. Also for 2017, Italian clothing brand Giordana replaces all apparel previously supplied from Swedish company Craft.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in {{the fall}} of 2010, Zipp {{released}} its first-ever aluminum components. Drop bars, stems, and <b>seatposts</b> are available in two versions: Service Course and the lighter Service Course SL. The Cannondale prepared by Cyclocrossworld.com team has used Service Course SL components from 2010 through 2016.|$|R
5000|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{about whether to}} grease carbon <b>seatposts</b> or not. There does not yet {{appear to be a}} consensus. There are now specialty products, referred to as [...] "carbon prep" [...] or [...] "carbon paste", specifically for the interface between carbon and most other materials.|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} with {{clamping}} stands not to clamp {{a part of the}} bike that cannot withstand the pressure, such as the tubes of many aluminum or carbon fiber frames, and non-cylindrical carbon fiber <b>seatposts.</b> An auxiliary bracket may be used with clamping stands to keep the steering mechanism from rotating.|$|R

50|$|Folding bikes {{generally}} {{come with}} {{a wider range of}} adjustments for accommodating various riders than do conventional bikes, because folding bike frames are usually only made in one size. However, <b>seatposts</b> and handlebar stems on folders extend as much as four times higher than conventional bikes, and still longer after-market posts and stems provide an even greater range of adjustment.|$|R
2500|$|Finally, {{manufacturers}} have also introduced the [...] "comfort bike" [...] category, {{to combine the}} soft ride and upright posture of cruisers with a more conventionally styled bike. Comfort bikes have such features as fenders, suspension <b>seatposts</b> and forks, and large padded saddles with giant springs. All of these features are copied from cruisers, but redesigned to look more like regular road or hybrid bikes.|$|R
50|$|Carbon fiber {{has also}} become more popular for components. Shimano, Campagnolo and SRAM have {{introduced}} carbon fiber for their high-end shifters and brake levers, cranks, and parts of their derailleurs. Carbon fiber stems, handlebars, shoe soles, forks and <b>seatposts</b> are also more commonplace, including integrated stem/handlebar combinations. The advantages of carbon fiber are low weight as well as increased vibration damping leading to a more comfortable ride.|$|R
