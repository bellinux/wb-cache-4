50|$|A <b>sustaining</b> <b>program</b> is a {{radio or}} {{television}} program that, despite airing {{on a commercial}} broadcast station, does not have commercial sponsorship or advertising. This term, mostly used in the United States, was common {{in the early days}} of radio, but has become unfamiliar, due to the nearly universal use of commercial advertising on radio and television.|$|E
50|$|Currently, most <b>sustaining</b> <b>programming</b> on {{commercial}} television {{is confined to}} public affairs, religious, and special television news programs (and even most religious programming is now brokered instead). <b>Sustaining</b> <b>programs</b> can occasionally appear in modern times, most commonly if a program loses advertisers (such as through boycott campaigns) but contractual obligations require the program to air until the contract expires, in which case a show may be moved to a graveyard slot to free up what has become highly valuable advertising space; ad rates for new shows are now based on complicated projections based on the network's other programs, and even the rare airing of a television pilot now almost always comes with network advertising.|$|R

The factors are synthesized into three themes; program characteristics, workplace capacity, and process and interaction factors. The majority of factors map onto commonly cited sustainability influences in implementation science. However, there was an additional focus for studies included in this review on the importance of factors such as program burden, program familiarity and perceived competence in program skills, workplace support for the program, staff mobility and turnover, supervision and peer support, and ongoing technical assistance. The need to use a conceptual framework and develop measures to guide and evaluate capacity building in EBP implementation and sustainment in low-resource community settings is highlighted...|$|R

When it began, it was a <b>sustaining</b> <b>program.</b> The initial sponsor was Los Angeles-based Ben Hur Products (later acquired by McCormick & Company), which promoted its coffee, tea and spices via the program. On Feb. 19, 1945, Safeway Stores, Inc. took over sponsorship. By 1948, Albers Brothers Milling Company had become the sponsor.

50|$|After {{finding an}} {{audience}} with Kate Smith's listeners, The Aldrich Family was launched in its own series as a summer replacement program for Jack Benny in NBC's Sunday night lineup, July 2, 1939, and it stayed there until October 1, 1939, when it moved to Tuesday nights at 8 p.m., sponsored by General Foods's popular gelatin dessert Jell-O, which also sponsored Jack Benny at the time. The Aldriches ran in that slot from October 10, 1939 until May 28, 1940, moving to Thursdays, from July 4, 1940 until July 20, 1944. After a brief hiatus, the show moved to CBS, running on Fridays from September 1, 1944 until August 30, 1946 with sponsors Grape Nuts and Jell-O before moving back to NBC from September 5, 1946 to June 28, 1951 on Thursdays and, then, as a <b>Sustaining</b> <b>program</b> in its final run of September 21, 1952 to April 19, 1953 on Sundays.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{increase}} {{was a result of}} Paley's second upgrade to the CBS business plan - improved affiliate relations. There were two types of program at the time: sponsored and sustaining, i.e., unsponsored. Rival NBC paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran. It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of <b>sustaining</b> <b>programs.</b> Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible: he would give the <b>sustaining</b> <b>programs</b> away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so. CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{evaluations}} {{show that}} {{conditional cash transfer}} programs change households’ investments in their young children, {{but there are many}} open questions about how such changes can be sustained after transfers end. This paper analyzes the role of social interactions with local female leaders for <b>sustaining</b> <b>program</b> impacts. The social interactions are identified through the randomized assignment of leaders and other beneficiaries to different cash transfer packages. Random exposure to leaders that received the largest package was found to augment short-term program impacts on households’investments in education and nutrition, and to affect households’ attitudes towards the future during the intervention. This paper shows that the strong social multiplier effects from leaders’ treatment persisted two {{years after the end of}} the program. Households randomly exposed to female leaders with the largest package sustained higher investments in their children and reported higher expectations and aspirations for the future of their children. These results suggest that program design features that enhance ownership of a program’s objectives by local leaders may shift other beneficiaries’ norms and sustain higher levels of human capital investments...|$|E

50|$|Non-commercial {{public radio}} {{stations}} are funded by donations and operate without radio advertising. However, {{many of their}} programs briefly acknowledge (through carefully worded underwriting spots) funding from commercial sponsors; thus, {{those that do not}} have such sponsors can be considered <b>sustaining</b> <b>programs.</b> An estimated 53% to 60% of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television's revenues come from private membership donations and grants, making <b>sustaining</b> <b>programs</b> viable in that sector. Most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising, pledge drives or telethons which can disrupt regularly scheduled programming. Some viewers find this a source of annoyance since normal programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience to solicit new members and donations, while others find it ironic that these pledge drives air the most desirable programming in order to solicit sponsorship for regularly scheduled shows they have no desire to watch, under the ruse that the donations are supporting the pledge drive programming.|$|R

40|$|In the {{lifecycle}} of {{an engineering}} education grant, the phase where best practices are sustained and disseminated {{is perhaps the}} most crucial stage for maximizing impact. Yet this transition phase often receives the least attention as project team enthusiasm can wane, while funding tapers off, and faculty priorities are pulled in other directions. There are numerous obstacles associated with <b>sustaining</b> <b>program</b> changes, even those perceived as very valuable. Typical challenges are: What happens when the funding runs out? What grant-developed programs should be sustained by the university? Does the institution need to internally allocate resources in an annual budget large enough to replace the grant? Ultimately, sustaining successful programmatic improvements is about “change management” in an institution. In this paper, we will review the literature relating to institutional change in engineering education. We will build on current curriculum change models, {{in the context of a}} major engineering education grant at Boise State University that included a variety of curricular enhancements, academic support, and outreach efforts. Over the past two years, the project team focused considerable effort on institutionalizing the most successful programs, and met with mixed results. While many programs will continue and benefit students long-term, other programs, even ones with stellar success and solid assessment, have not been entirely adopted for a number of reasons that we will examine. We will review the role assessment played in the process of program transfer (from the grant to the university) and lessons learned about building alliances with other campus partners to achieve university-level buy-in, well before the last stage of the grant. Finally, we will discuss two factors that are not identified in institutional change literature, but that contributed significantly to the successful transition of our programs—the importance of taking a research based approach, and flexibility in time and resource allocation...|$|E
