5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, <b>seasonal</b> climate. These traits can include <b>seasonal</b> fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and <b>seasonal</b> breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} Nokian tyres is <b>seasonal,</b> {{as a high}} {{percentage}} of the company's sales are of winter tyres, but it has reduced <b>seasonal</b> fluctuations by its development of summer and all weather tyres. According to the company, more than 80% of its passenger car and van tyre sales are winter tyres. Winter tyre sales have a strong <b>seasonal</b> characteristic with 30% of retail sales occurring in the ten days after the first snowfall, thus presenting challenges in production and delivery.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and <b>seasonal</b> availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and <b>seasonal</b> changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a <b>seasonal</b> {{prevailing}} wind that lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big <b>seasonal</b> winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat low over the Asian, African, and North American continents during May through July, and over Australia in December.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are {{not wholly}} migratory, {{but they do}} exhibit regular <b>seasonal</b> {{movements}} {{in different parts of}} Australia. In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer wet season. In {{other parts of the country}} cockatoo <b>seasonal</b> movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland, and New South Wales. In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a north-south pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies naso, while movements by subspecies samueli in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more broadly to identify species present in a body of water, debris filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track <b>seasonal</b> populations.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{slightly}} less active June and July than originally anticipated, TWC/WSI downgraded their number of named storms from 20 to 19 on July21, but kept their June numbers of 11 hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes untouched. In their final <b>seasonal</b> prediction on August4, CSU left their June numbers the same, predicting 18 named storms, 10 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 185 units. That same day, TSR reduced their predictions for their final <b>seasonal</b> outlook, expecting 17.8 named storms, 9.7 hurricanes, 4.5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 183 units. On August5, NOAA announced the official development of La Niña {{in their last}} <b>seasonal</b> outlook. The organization lowered the upper bounds of their forecast compared to May due to less early season activity than expected, in all predicting 14 to 20 named storms, 8 to 12 hurricanes, and 4 to 6 major hurricanes. TWC/WSI issued two final forecasts on August25 and September22, both expecting 18 named storms and 10 hurricanes. The number of major hurricanes was increased from 5 to 6 in their September update, however.|$|E
