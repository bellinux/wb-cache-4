40|$|Abstract Lateral Torsional Buckling of Welded Wide Flange Beams Md. Imran Kabir Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) can {{be defined}} as a {{combination}} of lateral displacement and twisting due to an application of load on an unsupported beam. Design specifications of Canada CSA S 16 - 14 provides solutions for LTB of welded and rolled beams that were derived for constant moment situation. Same equations have been used over the years for design of rolled and welded <b>shape</b> <b>beams.</b> A recent study has shown that the current code equations might overestimate the capacity of the welded wide <b>shape</b> <b>beams,</b> which make them unsafe to use. Thus a detailed study is required to evaluate the existing LTB equations for welded wide flange (WWF) shapes. This thesis evaluates the performance of current equations in providing LTB capacities of WWF <b>shape</b> <b>beams.</b> A nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to investigate the LTB capacity of WWF <b>shape</b> <b>beams.</b> The validated FE model is used to analyze a series of simply supported WWF <b>shape</b> <b>beams</b> with varying unbraced lengths and subjected to equal end moments. Four different patterns of residual stresses and a constant initial imperfection of L/ 1000 are considered for the analysis.
