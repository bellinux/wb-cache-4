Since no sonar equipment was fitted these depth charges were unlikely to actually damage a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and <b>stowed</b> each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E

The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly <b>stowed</b> in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Front, it {{was first}} used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) {{resisting}} the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be <b>stowed</b> within the turret, reducing capacity to 68. Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st {{were lost in the}} area between 12 and 13 August to ambushes and flank attacks by Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain.|$|E

Her secondary armament consisted of ten 9.2-inch (234mm) guns, eight in twin gun turrets on each {{corner of the}} superstructure, and a single gun turret between them. For defence against torpedo boats, Lord Nelson carried twenty-four QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns and two 3-pounder guns. She also mounted five submerged 18-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were <b>stowed</b> aboard.|$|E
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were <b>stowed</b> in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E

5|$|The closest large German unit to {{the canal}} bridge was the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon.

At 02:00, the 2nd Battalion headed for the bridges from the west, supported by the 1st Panzerjager Company {{and part of the}} 989th Heavy Artillery Battalion coming from the north. As the first Panzer IVs from the north reached the junction leading to the bridge, the leading vehicle was hit by a round from 'D' Company's only serviceable PIAT anti-tank weapon. The vehicle exploded, setting off its <b>stowed</b> ammunition, and the other tanks withdrew.|$|E
