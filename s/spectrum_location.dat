50|$|The SARH system {{determines the}} closing {{velocity}} using the flight path geometry shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity {{is used to}} set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown {{at the bottom of}} the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the <b>spectrum</b> <b>location</b> set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by flight dynamics using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.|$|E

Cognitive-radio technology has capabilities for acquiring accurate <b>spectrum,</b> <b>location,</b> and environmental information, due to its unique features such as <b>spectrum,</b> <b>location,</b> and environmental awareness. The goal {{of this paper is}} to give a comprehensive review of the implementation of these concepts. In addition, the dynamic nature of cognitive-radio systems - including dynamic spectrum utilization, transmission, the propagation channel, and reception - is discussed, along with performance limits, challenges, mitigation techniques, and open issues. The capabilities of cognitive-radio systems for accurate characterization of operational environments are emphasized.

Hence, the need to normalize the pitch delay is by 147, the maximum pitch delay, before the hiding process. The normalized pitch delay will have a value ranging from 0 to 1. For this reason, the best location to hide these parameters is the last cover speech <b>spectrum</b> <b>location</b> since the amplitude of this last component is very small.|$|E

30|$|Several {{theoretical}} approaches rely on {{the existence}} of secondary channels, which can be opportunistically accessed. However, in practical cases and without assuming external knowledge, spectrum holes are dynamically formatted (both in size and <b>spectrum</b> <b>location),</b> rendering difficult the definition of convenient secondary channels. Such an obstacle can be overcome by obtaining knowledge on the initially unknown PU spectrum allocation and consequently, our methodology can efficiently contribute to this direction. This knowledge also enables SUs to estimate the expected length of white spaces that could potentially be detected at each band of interest and hence, determine transmission policies based on their communication needs. For instance, inferring technology channels of length equal to 200 kHz (e.g., GSM case) allows SUs to expect larger white spaces only at the cost of significantly higher reconfiguration overhead due to reasons explained in Section 5.2.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} fuse two main {{enabling}} features in cognitive radio systems (CRS) : <b>spectrum</b> sensing and <b>location</b> awareness {{in a single}} compressed sensing based formalism. In this way, we exploit sparse characteristics of primary units to be detected, {{both in terms of}} <b>spectrum</b> used and <b>location</b> occupied. The compressed sensing approach also allows to overcome hardware limitations, in terms of the incapacity to acquire measurements and signals at the Nyquist rate when the spectrum to be scanned is large. Simulation results for realistic network topologies and different compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms testify to the performance and the feasibility of the proposed technique to enable in a single formalism the two main features of cognitive sensor networks...|$|R

40|$|In the {{emerging}} paradigm of open spectrum access, cognitive radios dynamically sense the radio-spectrum environment and must rapidly tune their transmitter parameters to efficiently utilize the available spectrum. The unprecedented radio agility envisioned, calls for fast and accurate spectrum sensing {{over a wide}} bandwidth, which challenges traditional spectral estimation methods typically operating at or above Nyquist rates. Capitalizing on the sparseness of the signal spectrum in open-access networks, this paper develops compressed sensing techniques tailored for the coarse sensing task of spectrum hole identification. Sub-Nyquist rate samples are utilized to detect and classify frequency bands via a waveletbased edge detector. Because <b>spectrum</b> <b>location</b> estimation takes priority over fine-scale signal reconstruction, the proposed novel sensing algorithms are robust to noise and can affordreduced sampling rates.

30|$|Many {{pieces of}} work have {{been devoted to}} design radar {{sequences}} which are capable of spectrum compatibility. For instance, the sequence designing technique proposed by Gerlach [10] can generate sequences with some desired spectral nulls by appending polyphase codes on a stepped frequency modulated pulse. Selesnick and Pillai [11] devote themselves to produce constant modulus waveforms with multiple notches in their frequency spectra (2011). Moreover, some waveform design algorithms are exploited for both <b>spectrum</b> <b>location</b> and auto-correlation function (ACF) requirements. For example, the technique developed by Lindenfeld [12] achieves frequency stop-band suppression and range sidelobe minimization by the joint design of the transmit signal and the receive filter (2004). Stop cyclic algorithm new (SCAN), proposed by He et al. [13], implements the spectrum space operation to consider both the stop-band suppression and the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) suppression (2010). A sparse frequency constant modulus sequence design algorithm, built by Wang and Lu [14], optimizes both the ISL metric and a penalty function which accounts for the sequence frequency allocation (2011). A spectrum-centric sequence design approach, proposed by Patton et al. [15], minimizes the transmitted energy over some frequency bands under the uni-modularity and ACF masking constraint (2012).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the algorithm {{development of a}} new fatigue data editing technique using S-T approach. In general, the S-transform (S-T) is a time-frequency spectral localization method which performs a multi-resolution analysis on signal. This method represents a better time-frequency resolution especially for non-stationary signal analysis. This technique was developed to produce shortened fatigue data for fatigue durability testing. The S-T method was applied to detect the damaging events contained in the fatigue signals due to high S-T <b>spectrum</b> <b>location.</b> The damaging events were extracted from an original fatigue signal to produce the shortened edited signal which has equivalent fatigue damage. Three types of road load fatigue data were used for simulation purpose, pave track, highway and country road. In this study, an algorithm was developed, to detect the damaging events in the original fatigue signal. The algorithm can be used to extract the fatigue damaging events and these events were combined in order to produce a new edited signal which neglect the low amplitude cycles. The edited signal consists {{of the majority of the}} original fatigue damage in the shortened signal with 15 – 25 % time reduction. Thus, it has been suggested that this shortened signal can then be used in the laboratory fatigue testing for the purpose of accelerated fatigue testin...|$|E
