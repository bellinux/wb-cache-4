50|$|This is in {{face-to-face}} tactical situations. Currently, a High-altitude airship {{project is}} planned to survey hundreds of kilometres as their operation radius, often much {{farther than the}} normal engagement range of a military aeroplane. For example, a radar mounted on a vessel platform 30 m high has <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> at 20 km range, while a radar at 18000 m altitude has <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> at 480 km range. This is significantly important for detecting low-flying cruise missiles or fighter-bombers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Horizon</b> <b>Radio</b> or Хоризонт (Horizont) in Bulgarian is a {{state-owned}} Bulgarian Radio Station, {{specializing in}} news coverage from Bulgaria. It {{is the most}} popular radio station in Bulgaria and it is part of The Bulgarian National <b>Radio</b> Network. <b>Horizon</b> <b>Radio</b> is considered the most independent media in Bulgaria with news and comments from around the nation. It has an extensive network of correspondents in every big city in Bulgaria, ready to report when the news breaks. The programme plays a lot of music from all genres but prominence is given to the latest in the pop charts. The motto of <b>radio</b> <b>Horizon</b> is [...] "Quick and in-depth".|$|R
50|$|The {{broadcasting}} {{division of}} the company was renamed <b>Standard</b> <b>Radio</b> Limited in 1941 when the Rogers family sold off the assets of Rogers Majestic {{two years after the}} death of Edward Rogers.

In January 1960, the TV DX interest was further promoted via Robert B. Cooper's regular DXing Horizons column.|$|R

50|$|Anomalous {{propagation}} (sometimes shortened to anaprop or anoprop) includes {{different forms}} of radio propagation due to an unusual distribution of temperature and humidity with height in the atmosphere. While this includes propagation with larger losses than in a standard atmosphere, in practical applications it is most often meant to refer to cases when signal propagates beyond normal <b>radio</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tamara could {{automatically}} track 23 {{radar and}} 48 IFF targets simultaneously. Its frequency band is 0.8-18 GHz. The nominal {{range of the}} system is 450 km, and it is generally limited by the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon.</b> It provides surveillance over a sector of approximately 100 degrees, with the later KRTP-91 system offering a wider 120 degree sector of surveillance.|$|R
50|$|The station began {{broadcasting}} in 1983 under Skeena Broadcasters. Around 1987, {{the corporate}} name changed to Okanagan Skeena Group Limited. In 1999, Telemedia Radio Inc. purchased Okanagan Skeena Group Ltd. In 2002, <b>Standard</b> <b>Radio</b> Inc. purchased the Western and Ontario operations of Telemedia. Some stations were then sold to other companies but <b>Standard</b> <b>Radio</b> retained the Okanagan Skeena group. On September 27, 2007, Astral Media Radio received Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approval {{to acquire the}} assets of the radio and television undertakings owned by <b>Standard</b> <b>Radio</b> Ltd., subject to certain conditions.

50|$|For analog TV, VHF {{transmission}} range {{is a function}} of transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and distance to the horizon, since VHF signals propagate under normal conditions as a near line-of-sight phenomenon. The distance to the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> is slightly extended over the geometric line of sight to the <b>horizon,</b> as <b>radio</b> waves are weakly bent back toward the Earth by the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to IRAS, no science {{data was}} {{recorded}} on-board ISO for later transmission to the ground. All data, both science data and housekeeping data were {{transmitted to the}} ground in real-time. The perigee point of ISO's orbit was below the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> of the mission control centers at both VILSPA and Goldstone, thus forcing the science instruments to be switched off at perigee.|$|R
40|$|Beaconing, the {{broadcast}} {{of information from}} one user of a network to all others within a certain neighborhood is required {{for a number of}} applications. This paper focuses on beaconing in a wireless, infrastructureless network with mobile users. In such a scenario, we analyze the performance of Advanced Aloha, the combination of Aloha with strong protection of messages against interference. Such protection is achieved through coding and other measures. Together with successive interference cancellation, it allows to resolve collisions. Analytical results will be presented for perfect interference cancellation. These include the maximum amount of messages per area and time for which a given communication range may be achieved, as well as the resulting maximum spectral efficiency at a receiver. Signal propagation according to a path loss exponent is taken into account together with a <b>radio</b> <b>horizon</b> limiting node visibility. Notably, this leads to results applicable to freespace propagation in contrast to other work ignoring the <b>radio</b> <b>horizon...</b>|$|R
