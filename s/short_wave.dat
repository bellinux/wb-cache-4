25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of <b>short</b> <b>wave</b> sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} <b>short</b> <b>wave</b> color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Due {{to extreme}} {{conditions}} in the field, {{there has not been}} any observational report on three-dimensional waveforms of <b>short</b> ocean surface <b>waves.</b> Three-dimensional waveforms of <b>short</b> wind <b>waves</b> can be found from integrating surface gradient image data (Zhang 1996 a). Ocean surface gradient images are captured by an optical surface gradient detector mounted on a raft operating in the water offshore California (Cox and Zhang 1997). Waveforms and spatial structures of <b>short</b> wind <b>waves</b> are compared with early laboratory wind wave data (Zhang 1994, 1995). Although the large-scale wind and wave conditions are quite different, the waveforms are resoundingly similar at the small scale. It is very common, among steep <b>short</b> wind <b>waves,</b> that waves in the capillary range feature sharp troughs and flat crests. The observations show that most <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> are far less steep than the limiting waveform under weak wind conditions. Waveforms that resemble capillary-gravity solitons are observed with a close match to the form theoretically predicted for potential flows (Longuet-Higgins 1989, Vanden-Broeck and Dias 1992). Capillaries are mainly found as parasitic capillaries on the forward face of <b>short</b> gravity <b>waves.</b> The maximum wavelength in a parasitic wave train is less than a centimeter. The profiles of parasitic wave trains and longitudinal variations are shown. The phenomenon of capillary blockage (Phillips 1981) on dispersive freely traveling <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> is observed in the tank but not at sea. The <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> seen at sea propagate in all directions while waves in the tank are much more unidirectional. @ Elsevier, Paris 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} modulation of capillary and gravity waves by long ocean waves is described. A pressure transducer is used to obtain water surface displacements, and a high-response laser-optical system is used to detect short-wave slopes. Analytical techniques are developed {{to account for the}} orbital motion of long waves. The local mean squared wave slope is found to be maximum leeward of the long-wave crests. For the long waves studied here and for <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> from 1 cm to 1 m, the longer a short-wave component is, the more leeward its maximum tends to occur. Also, the <b>shortest</b> <b>waves</b> tend to modulate least.

40|$|The {{long waves}} that cause slugs almost always form {{more slowly than}} <b>short</b> <b>waves,</b> and linear {{stability}} always predicts that the growth rate for long waves is much less than that for <b>short</b> <b>waves.</b> However, at many conditions above neutral stability, long waves dominate the wave field. Three different studies were undertaken {{as part of the}} funded work: (1) linear interaction for unsteady flows; (2) wave evolution in oil-water channel flows; (3) retrograde stability and subcritical bifurcations. The oil-water system was used as a surrogate for gas-liquid systems because the gas phase is usually turbulent, and this complication is thus avoided although the phenomena involved are similar. The following overall conclusions about flow regime development were reached: (a) Oscillations in pressure and flow rate, due to interfacial waves or a malfunctioning pump, can cause significant growth rate changes in <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> within narrow frequency ranges, but probably do not have a large effect on long waves and thus regime transition. (b) Linear and nonlinear processes act together to cause regime transitions; however, it is almost certain that long waves cannot form solely by nonlinear energy transfer from <b>shorter</b> <b>waves.</b> (c) The nonlinear coefficient spectrum contains the information necessary to tell if certain wave interactions will occur to a significant extent...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{developing}} interfacial waves on oil-water channel flows show that long wave modes form and grow to large amplitude {{even though they}} have much smaller linear grow rates than <b>shorter</b> <b>waves.</b> There is evidence for a &quot;triggering &quot; of these long waves by interaction with much <b>shorter</b> <b>waves,</b> although most of the energy for wave growth comes from the mean flow. Thus linear instability of these long waves is a necessary condition for their formation and consequently, for flow regime transitions from a stratified state. However, experiments in a rotating Couette flow show regimes of no wave growth, even when long waves are unstable. The apparent reason for this is given by numerical integration of the equations that describe weaklynonlinear wave modes at the interface. The simulations show a cascade of energy from long to <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> and no preferred wavenumber in the spectrum...|$|R

25|$|An image {{intensifier}} or {{image intensifier}} tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image intensifier), or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or <b>short</b> <b>wave</b> infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or <b>short</b> <b>wave</b> transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
