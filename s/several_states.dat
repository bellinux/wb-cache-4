5|$|The United States {{ultimately}} {{ratified the}} U.N.'s Genocide Convention in 1986.

5|$|Both {{forces were}} {{composed}} of troops from <b>several</b> <b>states</b> and lands, including numerous mercenaries; for example, Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side. The knights also invited guest crusaders. Twenty-two different peoples, mostly Germanic, joined them. Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia, Frisia, Austria, Swabia and Stettin (Szczecin). Two Hungarian nobles, Nicholas II Garay and Stibor of Stiboricz, brought 200 {{men for the}} Knights, but support from Sigismund of Hungary was disappointing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in <b>several</b> <b>states</b> were wearing the dress in public.

5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although <b>several</b> <b>states</b> instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5|$|Following {{contentious}} {{battles in}} <b>several</b> <b>states,</b> the proposed Constitution reached that nine state ratification plateau in June 1788. On September 13, 1788, the Articles of Confederation Congress certified {{that the new}} Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for the new system to be implemented and directed the new government to meet in New York City on the first Wednesday in March the following year. On March 4, 1789, the new frame of government came into force with eleven of the thirteen states participating.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of <b>several</b> <b>states</b> were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{approved}} by the requisite three-fourths of the <b>several</b> <b>states,</b> there being 14 States in the Union at the time (as Vermont had been admitted into the Union on March 4, 1791), the ratification of Articles Three through Twelve was completed and they became Amendments 1 through 10 of the Constitution. President Washington informed Congress of this on December 30, 1791.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the <b>several</b> <b>states</b> (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon {{to help protect}} them from frequent Comanche raids. Over the next four years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 <b>several</b> <b>states</b> revolted. As the unrest spread, Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon and requested {{the return of the}} cannon.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 Congress {{passed a}} law that gave <b>several</b> <b>states</b> {{wetlands}} within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act ensured that the state {{would be responsible for}} funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|In March 1906, Commissioner of Corporations James Rudolph Garfield {{submitted}} {{a report to}} President Roosevelt, alleging large-scale rebating in Standard Oil shipments. Federal prosecutors in <b>several</b> <b>states</b> and territories sought indictments against components of the Standard Oil Trust. On June 28, 1906, Standard Oil of Indiana was indicted on 6,428counts of violation of the Elkins Act for accepting rebates on shipments on the Chicago & Alton Railroad. The case was assigned to Landis.|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from <b>several</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
