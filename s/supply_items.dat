50|$|Kraljic (1983) {{considered}} two variables: profit {{impact and}} supply risk. The profit {{impact of a}} given <b>supply</b> <b>item</b> can be {{defined in terms of}} the volume purchased, the percentage of total purchase cost or the impact on product quality or business growth. Supply risk is assessed in terms of the availability and number of suppliers, competitive demand, make-or-buy opportunities, storage risks and substitution possibilities. Based on these two variables, materials or components can be divided into four supply categories: (1) non-critical <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: low; profit impact: low), (2) leverage <b>items,</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: low; profit impact: high), (3) bottleneck <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: high; profit impact: low), and (4) strategic <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: high; profit impact: high). Each category requires a specific supplier strategy.|$|R

50|$|In {{its first}} two decades, {{the mission of the}} Richmond Quartermaster Depot was one of {{traditional}} logistics support to the U.S. Army with emphasis on Quartermaster items. When the Military General Supply Agency was activated in 1962, it absorbed the Defense Supply Agency. This resulted in an expanded mission for the depot, which included supply management of more than 30,000 general <b>supply</b> <b>items</b> for the military services and certain civilian agencies worldwide. The installation name changed to Defense General Supply Center to match its new logistical mission. In 1977 Defense Supply Agency became Defense Logistics Agency. In 1986, depot operations were separated from inventory control point functions and a separate command was established on the site: Defense Distribution Depot Richmond.|$|E
50|$|In {{the table}} above, each class of supply has a consumer. Some classes of supply have a linear demand relationship—as more troops are added more <b>supply</b> <b>items</b> are needed—as more {{equipment}} is used more fuel and ammo is consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages {{more and more}} repair parts are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stays consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying to future scenarios, the US military can accurately supply troops with the items necessary at the precise moment they are needed. History has shown that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force. Lack thereof {{can lead to a}} clunky, slow, and ill-equipped force with {{too much or too little}} supply.|$|E
