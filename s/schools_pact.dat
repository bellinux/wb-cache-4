50|$|Molitor {{was born}} in Kermanshah, Iran, {{the son of a}} Belgian civil servant, {{established}} in Persia since 1901 on a mission of modernization of the Persian customs. In 1935 he obtained the title of Doctor in Law, and since 1937 pursued a career in the Belgian public office. He was also the principal private secretary of the Minister Pierre Harmel and was the craftsman of the <b>school</b> <b>pact</b> of 1958, which ended a period of political dissension over the funding of secondary education. Since the end of World War II, André Molitor directed La Revue Nouvelle, (E : New Review), a Christian Democrat publication in Belgium. He directed the review Administration publique (E: Public administration). At his retirement in 1977 André Molitor took up the presidency of the King Baudouin Foundation, until 1986.|$|R
50|$|As such {{the liberal}} party is the oldest {{political}} party of Belgium. In 1846, Walthère Frère-Orban succeeded in creating a political program which could unite several liberal groups into one party. Before 1960, the Liberal Party of Belgium was barely organised. The <b>school</b> <b>pact</b> of 1958, {{as a result of}} which the most important argument for the traditional anti-clericalism was removed, gave the necessary impetus for a thorough renewal. During {{the liberal party}} congress of 1961, the Liberal Party was reformed into the bilingual Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV-PLP), and Omer Vanaudenhove became the chairman of the new party. The new liberal party, which struggled with an anti-clerical image, opened its doors for believers, but wasn't too concerned about the situation of workers and primarily defended the interests of employers. It is a central principle of Classical Liberalism that employers and employees do NOT have opposed long term interests.|$|R

50|$|In 2015 Nugent told RTÉ {{that the}} Irish blasphemy law had caused Irish media to self-censor their output, {{saying that he}} had been told before several live {{interviews}} not to say anything blasphemous. He represented Atheist Ireland at the first formal meeting between an Irish Prime Minister and members of an atheist advocacy group {{in the history of the}} State, where they argued how the Constitution, education system and laws and practices systemically discriminate against atheists. Speaking in Germany on the day of the Irish marriage equality referendum victory, he described the result as the start of the fall of Ireland’s religious Berlin Wall. He and Jane Donnelly briefed the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, before the UN questioned Ireland’s human rights record, and told the Committee that Ireland repeatedly ignores the rights of atheists and non-Christian children in the education system. He launched the <b>Schools</b> Equality <b>PACT,</b> which outlined Atheist Ireland’s plans for a fair education system. PACT is an acronym for four areas of legal change - Patronage, Access, Curriculum and Teaching. When RTÉ unveiled a new-look 6pm TV Angelus, he argued that it is not the role of a public service broadcaster to take a Catholic call to prayer and turn it into something else. A Dublin school canceled an invitation to Nugent to address its final-year students on the basis that it would clash with its Catholic ethos.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographical}} {{focus of}} this study is on that section of Southeast Portland which has been designated by the Office of Econom 1 c Opportunity as a poverty pocket because of an incidence of low-income families exceeding. (See Figure 2, Appendix A.) As such, the area is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Portland Metropolitan Steering Committee, the OEO community action agency for Portland. Under the auspices of this agency, the four neighborhoods in the area (Brooklyn, Buckman, Richmond and Sunnyside) in 1966 formed a separate non-profit delegate agency which was named Portland Action Committees Together, Incorporated (PACT). PACT originally was responsible for administering War on Poverty programs through three neighborhood centers in the area. Its functions have changed but it still remains very much involved, even providing the terms by which the area is known: the PACT target area. The particular focus of the study has to do with the mental health of elementary School age children in the PACT target area. The original, and still primary, purpose of this study was to provide a statistical data base for a grant proposal to fund a children 2 ̆ 7 s mental health service agency in the PACT target area of Southeast Portland. Since the original conception by Jack Tovey of the Child Psychiatry Department, University of Oregon Medical <b>School,</b> and <b>PACT</b> staff, the plan has been subsumed under the planning auspices of the Comprehensive Mental Health Planning Committee, a group whose aim is to work toward expanding and consolidating mental health services in all dimensions for the Southeast Portland area...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{government}} {{has become a}} fashionable topic of analysis, but the impact of regional autonomy on public policy has so far received little attention. In this book, Stefaan De Rynck examines how the creation of regional {{government has}} affected the substance of public policies in Belgium. He explains the observed pattern of policy change by referring to shifts in regional power structures. His publication offers a political analysis of policy change, and warns against concluding that public policy is responsive to social problems or cultural differences between regional societies. The book demonstrates the importance of political action for understanding the link between political institutions and policy change. In its case-studies, Changing Public Policy: The Role of the Regions focuses {{on the development of}} education and agri-environmental policy in Flanders and Wallonia since 1988, the year in which competence for these sectors was transferred from the national to the regional level. The research material on the policy cases covers a twelve-year period. It is based on a wide range o interviews and extensive documentary analysis. This study — based on a thesis presented at the European University Institute was awarded a distinction in the annual Committee of the Regions thesi competition in 2001.

40|$|This study explores {{whether a}} novel parent-supported {{emotional}} literacy programme called Parents And Children Together (PACT) {{is associated with}} improved social and emotional development for children compared to a standard curriculum. In eight schools in Cornwall, 686 children from Years 3 to 6 and their families participated in the PACT programme, and were compared with 212 peers from four demographically-matched schools who received a standard curriculum. Parents in intervention schools believed that the PACT programme had a significant {{positive impact on the}} social and emotional development of their children and improved the partnership with their child's school. Parental ratings of their child's emotional literacy was significantly higher after participation in the programme, and the children rated themselves significantly less likely to need further help in the future than those in the control schools. The implications for comprehensive mental health services are considered, and recommendations made for developing school and home-based emotional literacy programmes. Schools, particularly in deprived areas, should be supported to take part in <b>PACT.</b> <b>School</b> nurses and other community practitioners should play a leading role in these primary prevention and mental health improvement initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Background Allergy related {{disorders}} {{represent a}} major health problem in most developed {{countries and the}} disorders have increased during the last 50 years. Few populationbased {{studies have focused on}} these disorders in early childhood and few have evaluated the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD). Having AD as well as other chronic disease is assumed to be associated with reduced mental health. Adolescents with AD are thought to be especially vulnerable, but few studies have included particularly large numbers of young people. Aims To study the prevalence and co-variation of allergy related disorders (wheeze, asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis) and allergen sensitisation among 2 -year olds in a general population (papers I and II) To study the severity of atopic dermatitis among 2 -year olds in a general population (paper II) To study the prevalence and impact of atopic dermatitis among adolescents in a general population (paper III) To study gender differences in relation to allergy related disorders and allergen sensitisation (papers I, II and III) Material and Methods Questionnaire data from a total population of 4783 two-year olds and data from the clinical examination of a subsample of 390 children were obtained from the PACT (Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim) study in 2005. Skin prick tests as well as severity scoring of atopic dermatitis was performed in the subsample. The Young-HUNT 1 study was conducted as a cross-sectional, population-based survey in 1995 - 97. Students aged 13 - 19 years completed a comprehensive selfadministered questionnaire on health and life-style during one <b>school</b> lesson. Results <b>PACT</b> questionnaire data from 4783 two-year olds (50. 2 % girls) and data from the clinical examination and skin prick test from a subsample of 390 (48. 5 % girls) were analyzed. Among the 4783 two-year olds the prevalence of reported wheeze was 26 %, doctor diagnosed asthma 7 %, atopic dermatitis (AD) 17 % and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis 3 %. Twenty-one percent had been allergy tested, and of these nearly 60 % reported a positive allergy test. In the subsample, the corresponding prevalence of AD was 21 %, but 16 % when diagnosed by the UK Working Party’s Criteria. More than 70 % of the children with AD had mild disease according to the different scoring systems for AD. Questionnaire data from 8817 adolescents (49. 7 % girls) aged 13 - 19 years were eligible for analyses. The prevalence of AD was 13. 6 % in girls and 6. 7 % in boys. Among teenagers with AD, mental distress was higher for boys (OR 2. 1 CI 1. 6 - 2. 9) compared with girls (OR 1. 3 CI 1. 1 - 1. 6). Among the toddlers more boys than girls had an allergy related disorder or a positive allergy test. However, among the adolescents more girls than boys had AD. Conclusions Almost 40 % of the 2 -year olds had an allergy related disorder, but less than 10 % had a positive skin prick test (SPT). Boys were more likely than girls to have an allergy related disorder or a positive SPT indicating a gender difference in the natural history of allergy related disorders. The amount of recognized allergic disorders among 2 -year olds represents a major burden for affected families and a special challenge for the medical profession. Fortunately, the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) is mild in most (70 %) of the 2 year-olds. Self-reported mental distress among adolescents with AD differed with regard to sex and age. AD and mental distress as well as most other chronic complaints were reported more prevalently among girls. For adolescents with AD, the association between symptoms and mental distress was stronger for boys than girls. Among adolescents, 10 % reported AD, and in this age group twice as many girls as boys had AD. This indicates a shift in gender preponderance, as there were more boys with AD at 2 years of age.
