5|$|After his {{graduation}} from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received {{a full scholarship}} to attend Duke University School of Law. The school was new and sought to attract top <b>students</b> <b>by</b> offering scholarships. It paid high salaries to its professors, {{many of whom had}} national or international reputations. The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition. Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association, inducted into the Order of the Coif, and graduated third in his class in June 1937.|$|E

Enrollment grew to 30 high school <b>students</b> <b>by</b> 1947. The academy began to operate independently from the college in 1957.

5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 <b>students</b> <b>by</b> 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883. The current weatherboard town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this. At the town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water.
