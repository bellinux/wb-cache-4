Since the term 'critical infrastructure' is quite young, this problem has not yet been explicitly treated in <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> activities. This paper presents results from a qualitative analysis of available regional <b>spatial</b> structure <b>plans</b> and from a survey of all regional <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> authorities in Germany.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build a bridge between climate change {{adaptation}} and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and design. It aims to develop a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework in which the properties of climate adaptation and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> are unified. Design/methodology/approach - Adaptive and dynamical approaches in <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> literature are studied and climate adaptation properties are defined in a way they can be used in a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework. The climate adaptation properties and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> features are aggregated in coherent groups and used to construct the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, which subsequently has been tested to design a climate adaptive region. Findings - The paper concludes that the majority of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> methods do not include adaptive or dynamic strategies derived from complex adaptive systems theory, such as adaptive capacity or vulnerability. If these complex adaptive systems properties are spatially defined and aggregated in a coherent set of spatial groups, they can form a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework for climate adaptation. Each of these groups has a specific time dimension and can be linked to a specific <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> "layer". The set of (five) layers form the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, which can be used as a methodology to design a climate adaptive region. Originality/value - Previous research did not connect the complex issue of climate change with <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> Many frameworks are developed in climate change research but are generally not aiming to meet the needs of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> This article forms the first attempt to develop a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, in which non‐linear and dynamical processes, such as climate adaptation, is included...|$|R

40|$|Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> is an {{approach}} in planning {{which is not}} defined universally and encompasses a range of elements for consideration in its practice. This is what literature indicates but this research is aimed to identify the understanding of Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> (SSP) and its related concepts in the South African context. It also identifies the preferred spatial concepts being used by <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> practitioners in Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning,</b> especially in the public sector. The concern with influencing factors is to clarify why certain spatial concepts are chosen. These influencing factors are probed through a qualitative case study of the City of Johannesburg in its immediate, broader and historical context. The research uncovers the influences and understanding of Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> and its related concepts through investigating the processes by which decisions are made to use certain <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> concepts. Some of the aspects investigated in terms of Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> include governance and politics around decision-making processes, international Influences on Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> {{in the context of}} South Africa, Town Planning principles which influence decision making in terms of the concepts used in Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning,</b> historical significance of the concepts used in South African Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning,</b> original meaning/intention of concepts chosen to be used in South African Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning.</b> The lenses of New Institutionalism, Governance and Power in Planning have been used to analyse the research data and it has been found that Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> is political in nature as it takes direction from the government in power. However, planning practise differs between the various spheres of government due to limited direction or co-ordination between the spheres of government. The study further illustrates that power in planning is linked to the position one holds in an institution in terms of decision making power but also that power is linked to knowledge. The research further uncovers how Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> possibly influences external forces and not only how external forces influence the practise and understanding of Strategic <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning...</b>|$|R

It is necessary develop coastal management strategies including <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> that can be adapted to potential climate change impacts over time. The importance of including flood risk policies in the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> cannot be overstated. While development strategies will be informed by national planning policy such as these guidelines and regional planning guidelines addressed above, they must take all practicable steps to ensure the prior identification of any areas at risk of flooding and flood zones in order to effectively shape the drafting process. The paper is focused on <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> of Estonian Coastal regions (coastal <b>spatial</b> <b>planning)</b> aimed to decrease risk by decreasing potential damage. Coastal flood risk is defined as a product of probability of event and its effect, measured in terms of damage. Flood risk management requires that consideration be given to coordination with different types of usage {{from the point of view}} of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> In certain situations, new types of usage are required in order to achieve an effective balance between existing interests and new possibilities. The study was guided by two research objectives: ? To examine the potential and actual role and impact of the climate change of <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> to flood risk management in Estonia, contribution to flood risk management in practice of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> ? To develop recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the contribution of <b>spatial</b> <b>plans</b> to flood risk management.
