500|$|Six {{people were}} killed in Northern Ireland, mostly due to fallen trees: two in County Fermanagh and one each in Cookstown, Dungannon, Omagh, and {{elsewhere}} in Tyrone. The cereal crop in Northern Ireland suffered greatly due to Debbie, with half of the yield being lost. Losses from the crop were estimated at £1 million (US$2.8 million). [...] In the wake of the storm, military ambulances from the Royal Army Medical Corps were dispatched to parts of West Tyrone. Power repair crews were dispatched for nearly a week repairing downed wires across Northern Ireland. Many public authorities paid tribute to the workers for their tireless work. After passing through Ireland, the storm brought strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Scotland and Wales, resulting in some damage and flooding in the region. On the coast of Lancashire and the Isle of Man, <b>sand</b> <b>storms</b> were reported, with significant sand deposits found inland.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to their}} withdrawal, the Australians briefed the {{incoming}} British troops. The {{men of the}} division then took over from the Australians and settled into their task of defending Tobruk, with what the Black Watch Regiment described as a sense that it was [...] "the main post of honour open to the British fighting man." [...] The soldiers' lives were uncomfortable: fresh water was scarce, washing was a luxury and done in sea-water, razor blades were in short supply, meals were basic and <b>sand</b> <b>storms</b> were common. The troops {{were engaged in a}} dull routine: daily artillery bombardments by both sides, Axis air raids every night on Tobruk harbour, and for the infantry, nightly patrols. These patrols, described by the Black Watch as [...] "pure 1914–18 warfare", varied from reconnaissance missions—to identify what was located at a certain position—to capturing enemy soldiers and large scale trench raids on enemy positions. Auchinleck and Rommel had planned offensive operations simultaneously. The latter sought to capture Tobruk, aiming to launch an assault during the period of 20 November– 4December, whereas Auchinleck planned to relieve Tobruk with a slightly earlier start date.|$|E

Over the last few days before the battle, some 95 additional vehicles were obtained, of which 80 were assigned to hauling ammunition.

The 17th Infantry Brigade finally received its 3-inch mortars but found them lacking their sights. An officer dashed back to Cairo to obtain these in time. Some 300 pairs of gloves and [...] of marking tape arrived with only hours to go. The gloves were distributed, but the tape did not reach the 16th Infantry Brigade in time, so rifle cleaning flannelette was torn into strips and used instead.|$|E

2500|$|During the Quaternary period, between 2 and 3 {{million years}} ago, the prairies {{were covered by}} a glacier, the Laurentide ice sheet. [...] It was [...] thick which {{advanced}} and receded several times across the prairies. There were multiple glaciations affecting the Saskatchewan area during the Pre-Illinoian, Illinioan, and Wisconsin stages of the last Ice Age. These glaciations occurred during the Quaternary period which comprises the last two million years. [...] Northern Saskatchewan and the shield area shows the effects of glacial erosion and scour; the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a location of glacial deposition and collection. In southern Saskatchewan there are late Pliocene, pre-Illinoian continental glaciation sand and gravel deposits left behind from water deposition (alluvial) and glacial edge deposits (colluvial). [...] By the study of till, terrain, {{the limits of the}} Illinoian glaciation are evidenced around Willow Bunch Lake, Wood Mountain, Cypress Hills area. [...] The melting glaciers left behind sand and, silt outwash plains. [...] The Great Sand Hills of Saskatchewan are evidence of winds and <b>sand</b> <b>storms</b> which have accumulated the sands left behind. [...] Retreating glaciers left meltwater which pooled in lakes. [...] Glacial Lake Regina covered south-central area, and Glacial Lake Agassiz covered much of Saskatchewan and neighboring regions of the US and Manitoba. [...] The ice and water retreated, and the lake beds formed flat plains. [...] The land exposed from under the ice sheets was rubble, and ridges of gravel.|$|E
60|$|Perseus flew {{where the}} wings bore him, over great mountains, {{and over a}} {{wilderness}} of sand. Below his feet the wind woke the <b>sand</b> <b>storms,</b> and beneath him he saw nothing but a soft floor of yellow grey, and when that cleared he saw islands of green trees round some well in the waste, and long trains of camels, and brown men riding swift horses, at which he wondered; for the Greeks in his time drove in chariots, and did not ride. The red sun behind him fell, and all the land was purple, but, in a moment, as it seemed, the stars rushed out, and he sped along in the starlight till the sky was grey again, and rosy, and full of fiery colours, green and gold and ruby and amethyst. Then the sun rose, and Perseus looked down on a green land, through which was flowing north a great river, and he guessed {{that it was the}} river Ægyptus, which we now call the Nile. Beneath him was a town, with many white houses in groves of palm trees, and with great temples of the gods, built of red stone. The shoes of swiftness stopped above the wide market-place, and there Perseus hung poised, till he saw a multitude of men pour out of the door of a temple.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{what was}} God's plan for raising the Jews {{out of this}} cowardly, slavish state? First, and above all, to make them trust in Him. While they were fearing the Egyptians, they could never fear Him. While they were fearing the Egyptians, {{they were ready to}} do every base thing, to keep their masters in good humour with them. God {{determined}} to teach them to fear Him more than they feared the Egyptians. God taught them that He was stronger than the Egyptians, for all their civilisation and learning and armies, chariots and horsemen, swords and spears. He would not let the Jews fight the Egyptians. He told them by the mouth of Moses, [...] "Stand you still, and the Lord shall fight for you," [...] and he commanded Moses to stretch out his rod over the sea. (Exodus xiv.) The Egyptians were stronger than the Jews--they would have cut them to pieces if they had come to a battle. For free civilised men like the Egyptians are always stronger than slaves, like the Jews; they respect themselves more, they hold together better, they have order and discipline, and obedience to their generals, which slaves have not. God intended to teach the Jews that also in His good time. But not yet. They were not fit yet to be made soldiers. They were not even men yet, but miserable slaves. A man is only a true man when he trusts in God, and none but God--when he fears God and nothing but God. And that was the lesson which God had to teach them. That was the lesson which He taught them by bringing them up out of Egypt by signs and wonders, that God was the Lord, God was their deliverer, God was their King--that let them be as weak as they might, He was strong--that if they could not fight the Egyptians God could overwhelm them--that if they could not cross the sea, God could open the sea to let them pass through. If they dreaded the waste howling wilderness of sand, with its pillars of cloud and fire, its stifling winds which burn the life out of man and beast, God could make the <b>sand</b> <b>storms</b> and the fire pillars and the deadly east wind of the desert work for their deliverance. And so He taught them to fear Himself, to trust in Him, to look up to Him as their deliverer whose strength was shown most gloriously when they were weakest and most despairing.|$|E
