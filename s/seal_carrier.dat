40|$|This {{investment}} project {{was dedicated to}} the development of models for low-noise garbage truck retrofitting in accordance with the acoustic requirements established through guideline RAL-UZ 59 for the award of environmental quality <b>seals.</b> <b>Carrier</b> trucks (MB 1613 KO) were retrofitted to meet low-noise chassis requirements in accordance with annex XXI, section 49, paragraph 3 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The noise of a newly designed low-noise lifting and tipping unit was reduced by 16 dB (A) as compared to the conventional ones. New covers were designed for bulk garbage containers. Noise reduction was 6 dB (A) during simulated lifting and tipping and 9 dB (A) during the transport phases. The cylinders of the presss plate were provided with position switches to slow the cylinders down before reaching the final position. The dumping body was noise-insulated for a noise reduction of 3 dB (A). The overall sound level A of garbage trucks operating state B was reduced by 5 dB (A) to 97 dB (A) in accordance with RAL-UZ 59. The guideline's acoustic requirements were fulfilled. New garbage trucks are manufactured meanwhile considering the developed noise reduction model. Trucks bearing the environmental quality seal for low-noise, low-emission vehicles are available on the market. (orig.)

40|$|Reducing {{blade tip}} {{clearances}} through active {{tip clearance control}} in the high pressure turbine can lead to significant reductions in emissions and specific fuel consumption as well as dramatic improvements in operating efficiency and increased service life. Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the outer case flanges to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, reburst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due {{to the possibility of}} throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a segmented shroud structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates. The ability of the nine electric stepper motors to control the position of the <b>seal</b> <b>carriers</b> in both open- and closed-loop control modes for single and multiple cycles was investigated. The ability of the system to follow simulated engine clearance transients in closed-loop mode showed the system was able to track clearances to within a tight tolerance (0. 001 in. error) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve upon current thermal active {{clearance}} control methods, a first generation, fast-acting mechanically actuated, active clearance control system has been designed and installed into a non-rotating test rig. In order to harvest the benefit of tighter blade tip clearances, low-leakage seals are required for the actuated carrier segments of the seal shroud to prevent excessive leakage of compressor discharge (P 3) cooling air. The test rig was designed and fabricated to facilitate the evaluation {{of these types of}} seals, identify seal leakage sources, and test other active clearance control system concepts. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present both experimental and analytical investigations into the nature of the face-seal to seal-carrier interface. Finite element analyses were used to examine face seal contact pressures and edge-loading under multiple loading conditions, varied E-seal positions and two new face seal heights. The analyses indicated that moving the E-seal inward radially and reducing face seal height would lead to more uniform contact conditions between the face <b>seal</b> and the <b>carriers.</b> Lab testing confirmed that moving the balance diameter inward radially caused a decrease in overall system leakage...|$|R

50|$|During the Greek War of Independence between 1820 and 1822, which {{occurred}} during his uncle’s second term {{as governor of}} Morea and {{had the support of}} major European countries, Reşid acted as the <b>seal</b> <b>carrier</b> for the Grand Vizier and commander-in-chief, Seyyid Ali Pasha. During the war, Reşid noted for the first time several key points that would majorly influence his later political life. First, he noted that Ottoman institutions required major reform, especially needing a modernized army like that of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had led the Egyptian army in support of the Greek rebels against the Ottomans. Secondly, he realized that foreign European assistance and support was essential for the continuation of the empire.|$|E
40|$|Improved {{blade tip}} sealing {{in the high}} {{pressure}} compressor and high pressure turbine can provide dramatic improvements in specific fuel consumption, time-on-wing, compressor stall margin and engine efficiency as well as increased payload and mission range capabilities of both military and commercial gas turbine engines. The preliminary design of a mechanically actuated active clearance control (ACC) system for turbine blade tip clearance management is presented along with {{the design of a}} bench top test rig in which the system is to be evaluated. The ACC system utilizes mechanically actuated <b>seal</b> <b>carrier</b> segments and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. The purpose of this active clearance control system is to improve upon current case cooling methods. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, re-burst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due to the possibility of throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). The active turbine blade tip clearance control system design presented herein will be evaluated to ensure that proper response and positional accuracy is achievable under simulated high-pressure turbine conditions. The test rig will simulate proper <b>seal</b> <b>carrier</b> pressure and temperature loading as well as the magnitudes and rates of blade tip clearance changes of an actual gas turbine engine. The results of these evaluations will be presented in future works...|$|E
40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a <b>seal</b> <b>carrier,</b> which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with C-seals, knife edge seals and cup seals. Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|E
