40|$|Glyphosate is {{the most}} widely used non-selective, {{systemic}} herbicide. It is easily translocated from shoot to roots and released into the rhizosphere, where it is immobilized at the soil matrix or microbially degraded. However, contradictory results are reported in the literature concerning the bio-availability of glyphosate residues in soils and the potential risks for intoxication of non-target organisms. This study addresses the question whether plant residues of glyphosate-treated weeds (model plant perennial rye grass.

The experiments were conducted as greenhouse studies on two soils with contrasting properties (acidic, <b>sandy</b> Arenosol, calcareous <b>loess</b> subsoil). Also the potential role of different waiting times between glyphosate application and sunflower cultivation was considered. On both soils, sunflower seedling growth and biomass production was strongly impaired by glyphosate pre-sowing treatments in the variants with 0 d waiting time and recovered within a waiting time of 7 - 21 d.

40|$|Summary-Inoculation {{of carrots}} with 40 types of bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, {{including}} clostridia isolated from cavity spots, failed to induce cavity spot in carrots. A combined stress of minimum 6 h flooding and temperatures higher than 28 °C clearly induced cavity formation. Sugars, amino acids, lipids and minerals leaked from the carrots after flooding and heating the roots. A longer growth period following stress markedly increased cavity spots. Soil types (<b>sandy</b> loam and <b>loess)</b> and several carrot cultivars tested had no marked effect on spot formation.

40|$|International audienceThe Dolní Vestonice loess {{section in}} the Czech Republic {{is well known for}} its {{high-resolution}} loess-palaeosol sequence of the last interglacial-glacial climatic cycle (Upper Pleistocene). The loess section is situated in a climatic transition zone between oceanic and continental climates and is therefore of great value in reconstructing past regional climate conditions and their interaction with climate systems, in particular that of the North Atlantic. Based on a combination of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, stratigraphic field observations and magnetic susceptibility measurements, a chrono-climatic interpretation of the Dolní Vestonice loess section is presented. To establish a reliable Upper Pleistocene chronology, a quartz OSL approach was applied for equivalent dose (De) determination. Monomineralic quartz extracts of three distinct grain sizes, fine (4 - 11 µm), middle (38 - 63 µm) and coarse (90 - 200 µm), were used and compared. Within error limits, the calculated OSL ages are the same for the different grain sizes, and the OSL ages are in stratigraphic order. The established OSL chronology is in agreement with a Weichselian litho- and pedostratigraphy. The Dolní Vestonice loess section is characterized by four pedosedimentary subsequences. At the base of the profile, subsequence I is characterized by a distinct Early Glacial soil complex, OSL-dated to c. 110 to 70 ka, representing one of the most complete records of environmental change in the European loess belt. Subsequence II is allocated to the Lower Pleniglacial and is characterized by laminated <b>sandy</b> <b>loess.</b> Middle Pleniglacial subsequence III is represented by a brown soil complex, and is followed by the uppermost subsequence IV, characterized by a thick body of laminated <b>sandy</b> <b>loess,</b> indicating strong wind activity and a high sedimentation rate of more than ~ 1 mm a- 1 during the Upper Pleniglacial. According to the OSL chronology, {{as well as to the}} sedimentological and palaeopedological investigations, it is likely that the sequence at Dolní Vestonice has recorded most of the climatic events expressed in the NGRIP d 18 O reference record between 110 and 70 ka. © 2012 The Authors.

In the last decade a number of novel compounds (i. e. fullerene derivatives) is being introduced into the market and specific analytical methods are needed for analytical purposes as well as environmental and safety issues. In the present work eight fullerenes (C 60 and C 70) and functionalized fullerenes (C 60 and C 70 exohedral-derivatives) were selected and a novel liquid chromatographic method was developed for their analysis with UV absorption as a method of detection. The resulting HPLC-UV method is the first one suitable for the analysis of all eight compounds. This method was applied for the analysis of fullerenes added to clayish, <b>sandy</b> and <b>loess</b> top-soils at concentrations of 20, 10 and 5 μg kg− 1 and extracted with a combination of sonication and shaking extraction. The analytical method limits of detection (LoD) and limits of quantification (LoQ) were in the range of 6 - 10 μg L− 1 and 15 - 24 μg L− 1 respectively for the analytical solutions. The extraction from soil was highly reproducible with recoveries ranging from 47 ± 5 to 71 ± 4 % whereas LoD and LoQ for all soils tested were of 3 μg kg− 1 and 10 μg kg− 1 respectively. No significant difference in the extraction performance was observed depending of the different soil matrices and between the different concentrations. The developed method can be applied for the study of the fate and toxicity of fullerenes in complex matrices at relatively low concentrations and in principle it will be suitable for the analysis of other types of functionalized fullerenes that were not included in this work...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the quality of}} shallow (about 10 m below surface level) and medium-deep (about 25 m below surface level) groundwater in the Netherlands in the 1984 - 2000 period. Observations were grouped according to groups of eco-district areas. The observed concentrations were compared with environmental quality objectives for groundwater. The percentage of the surface with groundwater at concentrations exceeding the environmental quality objectives (%OBS) was calculated and depicted in maps for 2000. Maps showing the change in %OBS in the 1984 - 2000 period are also presented. In the <b>sandy</b> and <b>loess</b> areas, high OBS percentages (at least > 10 %) are shown for nitrate, potassium and aluminium that are {{the effect of a}} combination of over-fertilisation, acidification and aggravation of drought. The effects highly resemble each other and are therefore not discernible. The %OBS that is observed in the shallow groundwater is often found to be higher than the %OBS in the medium-deep groundwater. Specifically, increased concentrations for cadmium, nickel and zinc occurs in the sandy area of the southern Netherlands. It is most plausible that the elevated concentrations represents the effect of a combination of over-fertilisation, acidification, aggravation of drought and the properties of the subsoil (poor, pyrite-containing), and not the effect of transport due to the burdening of the subsoil (caused by direct burdening with trace elements from the metal industry or fertiliser/manure). In clay and peat areas, high %OBS's are found for chloride, sulphate, ammonium, phosphate and potassium as a result of marine deposits. Often the %OBS observed in medium-deep groundwater are higher than in shallow groundwater. The %OBS for arsenic is inherently high in the marine clay and peat areas. In general, the groundwater quality did not change much in the 1984 - 2000 period. Only the concentration of chloride shows a decrease. This corresponds with the observed decrease in the chloride load on the soil in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the degree of}} {{leaching}} of the nitrogen surplus to groundwater and surface waters is calculated per soil type for arable land and grassland. Leaching differs between soil types and forms of land use. For arable land on well drained sandy soils about 90 % of the nitrogen surplus leaches from the root zone. For grassland on peat soils this is only 5 %. A nitrogen surplus is the remainder of nitrogen supply, for example via artificial fertiliser and manure, and nitrogen removal, for example via harvest of crops. Of the three soil types considered leaching of nitrogen decreases in the order: sand - clay - peat. For sandy soils leaching is largest for well drained soils with relatively deep groundwater levels and smallest for poor drained soils with shallow groundwater. In addition leaching is larger for arable land than for grassland. This data is of importance to prevent too much leaching of nitrogen to groundwater and surface waters due to fertilisation. The Nitrates Directive obliges all Member States to prevent this. The Netherlands have developed a system of nitrogen use standards that limits both total nitrogen use and nitrogen use via animal manure. For arable and horticultural crops grown on <b>sandy</b> soils or <b>loess</b> nitrogen use standards are not yet available for 2008 and 2009.

The middle Yellow River basin {{is located in the}} transitional zone from subhumid to semiarid climates, and covered by a thick loess mantle. Neighboring on the desert areas to the northwest, the surface material of the Loess Plateau exhibits some marked areal differentiation in grain size and forms three zones covered by <b>sandy</b> <b>loess,</b> (typical) loess and clayey loess from northwest to southeast. Controlled by these physico-geographical conditions, the grain size of river-transported sediment shows some particular characteristics; at small water discharge or SSC, the grain size of suspended sediment abruptly decreases to a minimum with increasing water discharge or SSC. At water discharge of more than ca. 40 m(3) /s or at SSC of more than ca. 40 kg/m(3), the grain size increases with water discharge or SSC. During the low-stage season, the relatively clear baseflow may scour the coarse bed materials, so the suspended sediment is relatively coarse. In the rainy season, rainstorm runoff washes out fine loess materials to the river, making suspended sediment fine. During relatively strong rainstorms, there often occur hyperconcentrated flows at SSC of more than 300 kg/m(3). The relatively coarse grains could then remain suspended in the mixture of water and fine suspended sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Application of the {{traditional}} lithostratigraphic framework to subdivide the Middle- and Upper-Quaternary locally-derived fine-grained deposits in the Netherlands is problematic. Deposits of many formations cannot be distinguished from each other based on lithological characteristics and stratigraphic position alone. To overcome this problem, we present a new, well-defined lithostratigraphy for these deposits, based on detailed research in {{the central part of}} the Roer Valley Graben. This area contains an up to 35 m-thick sedimentary record of Middle- and Upper-Quaternary sand, loam and peat deposits. These have mainly been formed by aeolian and small-scale fluvial processes and have been preserved as a result of tectonic subsidence. The traditional lithostratigraphic subdivision of these deposits into three formations (Eindhoven Formation, Asten Formation and Twente Formation) was based on a combination of litho-, bio- and chronostratigraphic evidence and the presumed widespread presence of a horizon of organic-rich interglacial sediments of Eemian age. To avoid intermingling of criteria regarding lithological characteristics, genesis and age, we now incorporate all fine-grained sediments into the new Boxtel Formation. The implications for the lithostratigraphic framework in other parts of the country are explored and discussed. Eight lithostratigraphic members are introduced that describe the most characteristic parts of the formation. To fully illustrate the sedimentary sequence in the Roer Valley Graben, two new members are defined here. The Best Member incorporates alternating floodloam deposits and sandy aeolian deposits in the lower part of the Boxtel Formation.

40|$|Water-induced {{soil erosion}} and shallow {{landslides}} {{interact with each}} other and need to be studied in an integrated approach to understand hillslope sediment yields. The principal aim of this thesis was to study and model soil erosion and shallow landslides in an integrated way. The thesis presents results from laboratory and catchment-scale studies and modelling. A laboratory flume under a rainfall simulator was used for shallow landslide and soil erosion experiments using <b>sandy</b> and silty <b>loess</b> soils. In the experiments, landslide initiation, retrogressions and slip surface depths were measured and monitored directly or by using video camera recordings. Sediment and runoff were collected from the flume outlet every minute during landslides and every 10 minutes before and after landslides. Changes in the soil slope, after landslides, were recorded. Initially, six experiments including two repetitions were conducted using sandy soils at a 30 º and 10 º compound slope configuration, but with different soil profile depths. The experimental results showed that total and landslide-driven sediment yields were affected by the original soil profile depth; the greater the depth, the higher the sediment yield. Later, twelve other experiments were conducted on different slopes using silty loess soils. The experimental observations were used to validate an integrated modelling approach which includes WEPP for runoff and soil erosion modelling, a slope stability model for simulating shallow landslides, and a simple soil redistribution model for runout distance prediction. The model predictions were in good alignment with the observations. In all (<b>sandy</b> and silty <b>loess)</b> experiments, peak sediment discharges were related to the landslide events, proximity to the outlet and landslide volume. The post-failure soil erosion rate decreased as a function of changes in the slope profile. The GeoWEPP-SLIP modelling approach was proposed for catchment-scale modelling. The approach simulates soil erosion using the Hillslope and Flowpath methods in WEPP, predicts shallow landslides using a slope stability model coupled with the WEPP’s hillslope hydrology and finally uses a simple rule-based soil redistribution model to predict runout distance and post-failure topography. A case study application of the model to the Bowenvale research catchment (300 ha) showed that the model predictions were in good agreement with the observed values. However, the Hillslope method over-predicted the outlet sediment yield due to the computational weighting involved in the method. The Hillslope method predicted consistent values of sediment yield and soil erosion regardless to the changes in topography and land-cover in the post-failure scenarios. The Flowpath method, on the other hand, predicted higher values of sediment yield in the post-failure vegetation removal scenario. The effects of DEM resolution on the approach were evaluated using four different resolutions. Statistical analyses for all methods and resolutions were performed by comparing the predicted versus measured runoff and sediment yield from the catchment outlet and the spatial distribution of shallow landslides. Results showed that changes in resolution did not significantly alter the sediment yield and runoff between the pre- and post-failure scenarios at the catchment outlet using the Hillslope method. However, the Flowpath method predicted higher hillslope sediment yields at a coarser resolution level. Similarly, larger landslide areas and volumes were predicted for coarser resolutions whereas deposition volume decreased with the increase in grid-cell size due to changes in slope and flowpath distributions. The research conducted in the laboratory and catchment presented in this thesis helped understand the interactions between shallow landslides and soil erosion in an integrated approach...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that a genetically meaningful decomposition (unmixing) of loess grainsize distributions can be accomplished with the end-member modeling algorithm EMMA. The independent decomposition of two series of loess grain-size records from the NE Tibetan Plateau and Loess Plateau spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle indicates that the two data sets are described by very similar mixing models. The average mixing model presented here is regarded as representative for the vast loess region in northern China and allows quantification of the contribution of three loess components to the loess grain-size distributions. A genetic interpretation and the paleoclimatic significance of the average mixing model have been provided by comparison of the modeled loess components with modern dust samples in terms of their grain-size distribution and flux rates, and by the distribution patterns of the loess components across the Loess Plateau reconstructed for the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. The <b>sandy</b> and silty <b>loess</b> components represent the coarse dust fraction supplied by saltation and short-term suspension processes over the proximal part of the Loess Plateau during major dust outbreaks in spring and early summer. The low-level winter monsoon (northwesterly wind system) is the likely transporting agent for these dust events. A clayey loess component represents the fine dust component supplied over the entire Loess Plateau by long-term suspension processes during major dust outbreaks and as part of a background supply system. The clayey loess component in the glacial loess deposits is dominantly supplied during major dust outbreaks by the northwesterly winter monsoon, whereas the clayey loess component in the interglacial paleosols is mainly supplied by non-dust-storm processes, possibly with a significant contribution by the high-level subtropical jet stream (westerly winds).

40|$|A {{distinctive}} northwest-to-southeast topographic grain {{consisting of}} fluted-ridge and trough landforms, aligned drainages, and elongated basins extends {{across much of}} northeastern Nebraska. Late Wisconsinan wind-scouring superimposed these oriented topographic features upon an existing dissected landscape composed mostly of older Pleistocene sediments. Subsequent loess deposition covered this deflated land-surface and preserved the character of former surficial elements. These paleosurface components include cover sands, ventifacts, wind-polished pebbles, sand wedges, ice-wedge casts, soil flow deposits, and scattered, predeflationary paleosol remnants. Ventifact fabric diagrams conform to landform alignments and independently substantiate the existence of northwest paleowinds. Locally, up to 20 meters of sediment may have been deflated from the till/outwash substrate to produce the fluted landforms. Cold, dry climatic conditions have been interpreted for this deflationary episode based upon comparable Atterberg Limit values between deformed and undeformed active layer sediments, and the scarcity of cryodisturbance structures. In northeast Nebraska, sand wedges and polygonal patterned ground are landscape position-dependent. This and the association of cover sands with fluted landforms suggest {{that a combination of}} aspect, stratigraphy, thermal contraction, and particle abrasion promoted the development of the oriented topography. Sieve analysis reveals that an upward-fining, particle-size continuum exists between sand wedges, cover sands, and <b>sandy</b> <b>loess.</b> The trend of lineated landforms in northeast Nebraska is similar to orientations observed elsewhere in the central mid-continent. Wind-aligned landforms discontinuously parallel the Late Wisconsinan glacial margin from central Montana to western Illinois. This geographic landform assemblage is associated with evidence of past permafrost conditions, suggesting the presence of an ice-marginal, cryodeflationary belt. This wedge-shaped, permafrost/paleowind corridor narrows to the east and south where the alignment pattern of wind-generated landforms changes from the prevailing northwest to a west-northwest orientation. The regional distribution of cryodeflationary indicators suggests the need for a reevaluation of initial Nebraska Sand Hills 2 ̆ 7 dune formation and for the origin of the Iowan Erosion Surface. ...|$|E
40|$|Loess grain-size {{distributions}} of four loess-paleosol sequences, {{located on a}} west to east transect from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to the north-western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), are unmixed with the end-member modelling algorithm EMMA. The unmixing {{results indicate that the}} loess is a mixture of three components representing very fine sandy, coarse silty and medium silty loess. The proportional contributions of these loess components in conjunction with loess mass accumulation rate estimates reveal that during the last glacial-interglacial cycle two contrasting dust supply patterns were active over the north-eastern TP and the north-western CLP: a constant supply of medium silty loess and an episodic supply of coarse silty loess and fine <b>sandy</b> <b>loess.</b> The variable input of the two coarse dust components is the main cause for the variation in grain-size patterns and mass accumulation rates between the studied sites. Alluvial fans and river floodplains in the intra-mountainous basins of the Tibetan Plateau and the deserts of northern China and Inner Mongolia are the main dust source areas for loess deposits of the north-eastern TP and the CLP, respectively. The sensitivity of these dust source areas to climate variations determines the timing of dust transport and deposition. In general, high dust fluxes are recorded during the last glacial period (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 - 4) and low dust fluxes during the last interglacial (MIS- 5). The loess sections in the two regions (TP, CLP) show contrasting dust flux patterns during MIS- 3. The records from the CLP show a relatively low dust input in this period, most likely related to increased humidity in the northern dust sources (deserts) where an increased vegetation cover minimized dust deflation. In contrast to this, the Tibetan Plateau records appear to show increased and highly variable dust fluxes for MIS- 3. Alternating periods of increased humidity and aridity on the Tibetan Plateau (during MIS- 3) have resulted in an overall increase in fluvial/alluvial activity. Hence, the enhanced availability of exposed fine-grained fluvial/alluvial sediments on the Tibetan Plateau facilitated dust entrainment which resulted in an increased dust supply towards the Tibetan Plateau sites during this period. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been devoted to {{disentangle}} the late Quaternary moisture and thermal evolution of arid central Asia. However, an array of paramount aspects has inhibited our complete understanding of the broad pattern of Quaternary moisture and thermal history of arid central Asia and underlying mechanisms. The Ejina Basin, with its suite of different sediment archives, is {{known as one of}} the main sources for the loess accumulation on the Chinese Loess Plateau. In order to understand mechanisms along this supra-regional sediment cascade (aeolian, fluvial and alluvial sediments), it is crucial to decipher the archive characteristics and formation processes. Five sediment archives from three lithologic units exhibit geochemical characteristics as follows: (i) aeolian sands have high contents of Zirconium and Hafnium, whereas only Hafnium can be regarded as a valuable indicator to discriminate the coarse sand proportion; (ii) <b>sandy</b> <b>loess</b> has high Calcium and Strontium contents which both exhibit broad correlations with the medium to coarse silt proportions; (iii) lacustrine clays have high contents of felsic, ferromagnesian and mica source elements e. g., Potassium, Iron, Titanium, Vanadium, and Nickel; (iv) fluvial sands have high contents of Magnesium, Chlorine and Sodium which may be enriched in evaporite minerals; (v) alluvial gravels have high contents of Chromium which may originate from nearby Cr-rich bedrock. Temporal variations can be illustrated by four robust factors: weathering intensity, silicate-bearing mineral abundance, saline / alkaline magnitude and quasi-constant aeolian input. In summary, the bulk-composition of the late Quaternary sediments in this arid context is governed by the nature of the source terrain, weak chemical weathering, authigenic minerals, aeolian sand input, whereas pedogenesis and diagenesis exert only limited influences. Hence, here demonstrates a practical geochemical strategy to discriminate sediment archives and thereafter enhance our ability to offer more intriguing information about the sedimentary processes in the arid central Asia. On the other hand, two parallel cores (ONW I, 6. 00 m; ONW II, 13. 35 m) were retrieved from lake Orog Nuur, in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Ample evidences reveal a marked moisture pulse during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (~ 36 -~ 24 ka) which might have induced the maximum last glacial expansion in the high elevated Khangai Mountains. A sharp transition of Termination I (~ 11 ka) is illuminated by geochemical, palynological, and ostracod data. Lower area of the Orog Nuur catchment was dominated by Artemisia steppe community in the late Pleistocene and altered gradually to Chenopodiaceae desert steppe in the Holocene. The early Holocene is also characterized by relatively humid environment, albeit discordant downcore variability of moisture and thermal signals can be derived between palynological and bulk-geochemical signals. Water body in the Holocene appears to be a distinct alkaline environment which was subjected to frequent allogenic input and disturbance of the late Pleistocene anoxic states. These two humid pulses may be the trait of a larger scale of arid central Asia that would be documented in a suite of archives. Considering kinetics, a coupled atmospheric component comprising both East Asian Summer Monsoon and strengthened Westerlies moisture supply seems to be the driving mechanism, and this coupled mode might have been modulated broadly by boreal insolation variances. On the other hand, four major harsh climatic phases were documented in the core at ~ 47 ka, ~ 37 ka, ~ 19 ka (gLGM) and ~ 13 -~ 11 ka (Younger Dryas) as playa phases. Reduced conveying of the Westerlies moisture along with the retreated East Asian Summer Monsoon might have contributed to these playa phases in the Gobi Desert. Continuous, high-resolution elemental abundances at a 1 cm interval were examined on core ONW II. Due to the predominant clay or silty-clay fraction in the sediments, Aluminium and Silicon display broadly identical pattern. Calcium behaviors may be ascribed to the authigenic calcite variance. Manganese and Cobalt act as sound indicator for the redox condition. Owing to the short burial time and weak diagenetic influence, Iron is not an indicator to the diagenetic processes. Likewise, Zirconium may be associated to fluvial clastic in relation to the lithotypes but not necessarily linked to the aeolian sands relative to that in the pelagic realm. Furthermore, Sulfur in lake sediments may denote the redox condition and Potassium is more likely linked to the K-feldspar which is associated with the allogenic fluvial inputs. The two sand layers corresponding to LGM and YD event were dominated by coarse sands. In the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, these two laminations provide an opportunity to be regarded as potential chronological benchmarks. As inferred from the biplot between Ca and Al/Si, disparate source lithotypes may exist before and after Termination I. The Holocene appears to be a distinct alkaline environment compared with the late Pleistocene. This may be ascribed to strengthened fluvial morphodynamics of the riverine inflows and intensified erosion of source rocks in the upper catchment of the Orog Nuur. In exceptionally arid realm, sands may exert significant influence on bulk-geochemistry of the lake sediments. In summary, considering the bulk-geochemistry of lacustrine sediments, paleoclimate would not be the solely governing factor, the coupled alteration of precursor rocks and decomposition intensity may also exert pivotal influences...|$|E
40|$|La sucesión sedimentaria de Gorina (Pleistoceno medio-tardío y Holoceno) está compuesta por depósitos eólicos (loess) modificados por pedogénesis en grado variable. Sobre la base de rasgos macromorfológicos (escala de campo) se reconocieron 5 unidades pedológicas (informalmente denominadas de arriba hacia abajo, Pu 1, [...] Pu 5). Sus composiciones granulométricas comprenden facies texturales fangosas (Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3), limosas (Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3) y limo arenosas (Pu 4, Pu 5), en casi todos los casos, con distribuciones unimodales. Las relaciones entre componentes gruesos y finos para los límites de 31 &# 956;m y 15 &# 956;m (g/f 31 &# 956;m y g/f 15 &# 956;m) indican una disminución del tamaño medio de partículas desde la parte {{superior}} de Pu 4 hasta el techo de la sucesión. La composición mineralógica de la fracción arena muy fina señala aportes litológicos heterogéneos procedentes de rocas metamórficas (asociación de cuarzo deformado, feldespato deformado, cuarzo microcristalino y granate), rocas graníticas (microclino, micas, cuarzo) y rocas volcánicas o volcaniclásticas basálticas (líticos volcánicos, anfíboles y piroxenos). La presencia escasa de vidrio volcánico fresco, excepto en dos niveles, procede de aportes piroclásticos distales (lluvia de ceniza). En la fracción arcilla se reconocieron illita, esmectita, caolinita, así como interestratificados illita-esmectita. La sucesión es el producto de la acreción de polvo eólico grueso a fino sobre una superficie topográfica con permanente formación de suelos que reorganizaba los materiales depositados sinsedimentariamente. Durante el proceso de sedimentación se registraron dos hiatus depositacionales significativos, representados por Pu 5 y Pu 1, y dos episodios erosivos que truncaron las superficies de Pu 5 y Pu 2. Durante el intervalo representado por Pu 4, Pu 3 y Pu 2, hubo relativa continuidad tanto en el proceso de acumulación como en la formación de suelos. The Gorina locality {{is representative}} of the Quaternary sedimentary record of the northeastern Pampas of Buenos Aires province. The main goals of this contribution are to analyze the composition (grain-size and mineralogy) of the deposits and discuss their nature and provenance. The general balance and interaction of the sedimentation process with pedogenesis and erosion are also evaluated. The studied section (middle to late Pleistocene and Holocene) is a quarry exposure about 11 meters thick. It was sampled at approximately 25 cm intervals for grain size, mineralogical and micromorphological analyses. The micromorphological results are fully discussed in a separate contribution (Zárate et al., 2000). Pedological features are common throughout the succession. Thus, a combined macromorphological and micromorphological approach was used to identify and differentiate paleosols. Five pedological units (from top to bottom Pu 1, Pu 2, Pu 3, Pu 4, Pu 5), apparently representing four discrete paleosols plus the surface soil, were initially differentiated on the basis of field-scale morphological properties (i. e., color, texture, structure, consistency, boundaries) following the approach applied by other authors in the region. Micromorphologically, the presence of excremental fabrics throughout the vertical column suggests that bioturbation processes were active as the sediment accreted with buildup of the surface resulting in conversion of A into B and C horizons (Zárate et al., 2000). The micromorphological data do not support the field differentiation of Pu 4, Pu 3, and Pu 2. Pedological features (e. g. excrements, secondary carbonate coatings, illuvial clay coatings) occur throughout without any obvious breaks or patterns that might warrant the separation into discrete paleosols. This ca. 8 m sequence is interpreted as an accretionary and/or welded pedocomplex with superimposition of secondary carbonate on illuvial clay features and illuvial clay coatings on excrements as the surface built up and horizons became transformed (Zárate et al., submitted). According to their grain size composition, the lower two units (Pu 5, Pu 4) are composed of sandy silt textural facies, whilst the upper three units (Pu 3, Pu 2, Pu 1) have mud and silt textural facies (Folk, 1954). The coarse/fine ratios (g/f 31 &# 956;m and g/f 15 &# 956;m) indicate a progressive grain size decrease from the lower part of Pu 4 upwards with dominance of finetextured sediments in the upper three units (Pu 3, Pu 2, Pu 1). The muds are unimodal (modes at coarse and medium silt) consisting of up to 30 - 50 % fine clay and colloidal clay. The silty textural facies are characterized by a non-prominent mode (coarse silt fraction) including up to 20 % of fine clay and colloidal clay. The sandy silt facies are unimodal and can be divided into coarse sandy silts (mode at the very fine sand fraction) and fine sandy silts (mode at the coarse silt fraction). The mineralogical composition of the very fine to coarse sand fractions consists of both deformed quartz and feldspar, microcrystalline quartz and garnet derived from metamorphic rocks; microcline, micas and quartz from granitic rocks along with volcanic lithics and pyroxenes from basaltic extrusive and intrusive rocks. Rare fresh volcanic shards occur throughout the succession, apart from in the lower parts of Pu 4 and Pu 1 where they are dominant and are probably related to volcanic ash falls. The clay fraction is composed of illite, smectite, kaolinite and interstratified illite-smectite. The illite, dominant at Pu 1, Pu 4 and Pu 5; smectite-interstratified illite-smectite, predominant in Pu 2; kaolinite very rare, though relatively constant in every unit. In Pu 3, the abundance of illite and smectite-interstratified illite-smectite are comparable. Both illite and smectite display low crystallinity, particularly in the lower units (Pu 3, Pu 4, Pu 5). The sedimentation of the parent material of Pu 5 was related to a supply of eolian dust, characteristic of a typical loess (mean grain size: medium silt). <b>Sandy</b> <b>loess</b> (mean grain size: coarse silt) accumulated during the deposition of the lower part of Pu 4, changing gradually to finer textured loess upwards (typical loess-clayey loess). The upper horizon (Ab) of Pu 4 coincides with the transition between the lower coarser and the upper finer textures of the succession. The Pu 2 and Pu 3 sedimentary interval appears to represent a relatively continuous sedimentation process with no significant changes in the sedimentary supply corresponding to a fine eolian dust (mean grain size: fine to very fine silt). The accumulation of this fine eolian dust (clayey loess) was also dominant during the time interval recorded by Pu 1. At some levels of the succession, aqueous transport (hillslope wash?) played a secondary role in the reworking of the sediments. The dominant granitic and metamorphic mineralogical composition of the very fine sand fraction suggests a source area related to crystalline basement rocks which might correspond to the Precambrian bedrock of Uruguay, the Paraná Basin and/or Sierras Pampeanas of Córdoba and San Luis. Volcanic ash falls from distant Andean sources played a secondary role except at two stratigraphic levels. The origin of the clay minerals could not be established, though other authors have related them to either neoformation or direct derivation from source areas. The Quaternary sedimentary succession of Gorina resulted from the accretion of coarse to fine eolian dust. Pedogenesis was simultaneous with the sedimentary process throughout the succession with two significant depositional hiatus recorded by Pu 5 and Pu 1 and two erosional episodes that stripped away the surfaces of both Pu 5 and Pu 2. The interval represented by Pu 2, Pu 3 and Pu 4 might reflect relatively continuous sedimentation. Alternatively, welding of pedological profiles may have masked any evidence for major depositional hiatuses...|$|E
40|$|El S de la provincia de Santa Fe y el NO de la provincia de Buenos Aires forman parte del Mar de Arena Pampeano (Sistema Eólico Pampeano), que ha sufrido una secuencia de episodios áridos y húmedos a {{lo largo de}} los últimos períodos del Pleistoceno. El paisaje actual resulta fundamentalmente de la influencia del período húmedo del Estadio Isotópico 3 (EIO 3; 64 - 36 ka) y de la actividad eólica durante un clima seco del Holoceno tardío (3, 5 - 1, 4 ka). La secuencia de eventos sedimentológicos y geomorfológicos fue la siguiente: Durante el período húmedo del EIO 3 se desarrolló una red fluvial de llanura, que {{actualmente}} forma la alta cuenca del Río Salado de Buenos Aires, labrada sobre sedimentos de la Fm Carcarañá. Posteriormente se depositó la Formación Teodelina, por sedimentación eólica. Esta tiene 10 a 12 m de espesor típico y unos 5 m en áreas sometidas a erosión; está compuesta por limo grueso arenoso y arena fina limosa, con modas principales entre 125 - 250 y 53 - 62 &# 956;m, color 10 YR 6 / 4 (marrón amarillento) y similares. La composición mineralógica de la fracción entre 53 y 62 &# 956;m está dominada por vidrio volcánico, con feldespato, cuarzo y alteritas como accesorios. La redondez y esfericidad de los granos varían entre bajas y moderadas, con dos poblaciones. En el Pleistoceno final ocurrió un episodio eólico predominantemente erosivo, dominado por vientos del oeste que labraron cientos de depresiones de miles de metros de extensión. Ocurrió una sedimentación discontinua de loess arenoso de hasta 2 m de espesor con granulometría bimodal. El período Hypsithermal del Holoceno Medio (8, 5 - 3, 5 ka) estuvo caracterizado por un clima cálido y húmedo con régimen údico, que generó un suelo en los terrenos loéssicos y produjo el ascenso del nivel del agua en las lagunas y pantanos. El Holoceno tardío, entre 3, 5 y 1, 4 ka, estuvo dominado por un clima seco, con formación de campos de dunas denominadas aquí Formación San Gregorio. Está formada por arena muy fina a fina, suelta, masiva, color marrón amarillento, y compuesta por trizas vítreas, alteritas y feldespatos como componentes principales y cuarzo como componente secundario; los minerales pesados son de procedencia serrana. La época actual está caracterizada por un exceso de agua en el paisaje; el proceso sedimentológico más relevante es la movilización de grandes volúmenes de sales disueltas, particularmente cloruros y sulfatos. The geomorphology, Late Quaternary stratigraphy, sedimentology and hydrology of {{the upper}} basin of the Salado River were investigated. The study area is located in S Santa Fe and NW Buenos Aires provinces (11. 000 km²) and comprises the NE sector of the Pampean Sand Sea (defined by Iriondo and Kröhling, 1995; Figures 1 and 2). The methodology applied in this study produced conclusions of stratigraphic and paleoclimatic nature. Works were performed in photographic and images cabinet, {{in the field and}} laboratory. In cabinet, the geological cartography produced by the first author in former projects was issued, particularly the geological map of Santa Fe province, in 1 : 500. 000 scale (Iriondo, 1987; Figure 3), the map of the South American plains (Iriondo, 1990 a; Petit Maire et al., 1999) and the map of the Pampean Sand Sea in scale 1 : 1. 000. 000 (Iriondo, 1992). That was complemented with satellite images and photomosaic analyses, integrated with classical topographic quadrangles of IGM. Field works made in the region covered a period of two decades. The first expedition was done in the year 1985, during a dry inter-annual period which favored the description of geological profiles and collection of fossils in the bottom of channels. Further expeditions were made in the 1990 's, resulting in the elaboration of the regional stratigraphy (Figure 4; Kröhling, 1998; Iriondo and Kröhling, 1995). The last three field surveys, between the years 2001 and 2004 (during the present humid period), were focused on the studies of dune fields, with areal sampling (about 50 samples) and the recovering of sedimentary cores (41 m drilled). Four stratigraphic boreholes were made in the study area and a complementary one outside it, with recovering of undisturbed samples and complemented with geotechnical S. P. T. tests. The main boreholes were drilled in Teodelina (34 ° 11 ´lat. S; 61 ° 31 ´long. W; 88 m a. s. l.; Santa Fe; Figure 5) and in San Gregorio (34 ° 17 ' lat. S y 61 ° 55 ´ long. W; 102 m a. s. l, Santa Fe). Laboratory analises comprises grain size analysis by sieving at intervals of ¼ &# 934; between 125 and 37 &# 956;m. For mineralogical determinations were applied loose grain techniques (in the very fine sand fraction) and X-ray diffractometry (on total samples; Figure 6). Complementary, morphoscopic determinations were carried out in the 74 &# 956;m fraction. Two geological formations of eolian origins are widespread in the region, Teodelina Fm (Late Pleistocene) and San Gregorio Fm (Late Holocene), which are formally defined here. The Teodelina Fm has a typical thickness of 10 to 12 m and has been eroded up to 5 m in some areas; it is composed of sandy coarse silt and silty fine sand, with main modes at 125 - 250 &# 956;m and 53 - 62 &# 956;m; the colour is yellowish brown and similar ones. The mineral composition of the 53 - 62 &# 956;m fraction is dominated by volcanic glass, with feldspars, quartz and alterites as accessory minerals. Roundness and sphericity of the grains vary from low to moderate, with two populations. The San Gregorio Fm is more than 7 m thick. It is composed of loose, massive, yellowish brown in color, very fine to fine sand (Figures 7 a and 7 b). The mineral composition is dominated by vitreous shards, alterites and feldspars as its main components and quartz as a secondary component; main heavy minerals were originated in the Pampean Ranges. The geomorphology of the area and the present hydric dynamics are controlled by eolian geoforms generated during the Late Quaternary. The exception is the fluvial collector in S Santa Fe which is a paleochannel of the Tercero river, controlled by tectonics (Figure 8). The study area underwent a sequence of dry and humid episodes during the Late Quaternary. Basically, the present landscape {{is the result of the}} influence of a humid climate which took place in the Oxygen Isotopic Stage 3 (OIS 3; 64 - 36 ka) and the eolian activity produced by a dry climate in the Late Holocene (3. 5 - 1. 4 ka). The sequence of sedimentary and geomorphic events deduced from the data of this research was the following: during the humid OIS 3, a fluvial net developed; it forms at present the upper basin of the Salado River of Buenos Aires, and is carved in the Carcarañá Formation (OIS 3; Kröhling, 1999). In a subsequent dry episode (Late Pleistocene), the Teodelina Formation was sedimented by eolian and associated processes. A largelly erosive eolian phase occurred after Teodelina Fm accumulation; it was characterized by Western winds that carved hundreds of large deflation hollows. A discontinuous sedimentation of a <b>sandy</b> <b>loess</b> up to 2 m thick with bimodal grain size distribution covered the minor accidents of the landscape. The humid period of the Middle Holocene (8. 5 - 3. 5 ka) was characterized by a warm and humid climate with an udic soil regime, which generated a soil profile on the loessic terrains and provoked the water level rising in lakes and swamps. The Late Holocene, from 3. 5 to 1. 4 ka BP, was characterized by a dry climate that produced the development of parabolic dune fields, named here as the San Gregorio Formation. An interesting geomorphological feature of the study area is represented by numerous shallow lakes occupying large deflation hollows generated by W winds. That indicates a shift of the Westerlies to the N up to 34 ° lat. S at the Upper Pleistocene-Lower Holocene interval (Figure 9). During the Little Ice Age the studied area underwent an arid climate with dominance of SW winds that produced a general mobilization of sand to the NE (Figure 10); the inherited shallow lakes were transformed in playas (Dangavs and Mormeneo, 2006). The present dynamics is dominated by an excess of water in the landscape as a consequence of the Present humid climate and the morphosedimentological control referred above. The significant sedimentological process is the mobilization of large volumes of dissolved salts, mainly chlorides and sulphates...|$|E
