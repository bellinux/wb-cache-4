40|$|In September 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{published}} a final rule governing {{the requirements for}} expedited <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> for products subject to an investigational new drug application.

In December 2011, we surveyed pharmaceutical and biotechnology sponsors regarding their <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> practices.

A qualitative study identifying influences on incident and <b>safety</b> risk <b>reporting</b> in NHS Trusts???, poster presented at Health Services Research UK, Nottingham, UK, 13 - 14 July, 2016. Patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> was introduced nationally as a patient safety improvement tool {{more than a decade}} ago (DOH, 2002), but there has been little evidence of impact in the interim (eg Shojiana, 2008). ?? Studies of patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> commonly investigate an aspect of risk or incident reporting shown to be critical in other sectors in order to comment on relative performance in healthcare. Such studies have identified barriers to patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> including: lack of shared vision for reporting, a lack of management support, poor feedback, system design, user-friendliness, and level of information required. Identifying improvements required for <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> in healthcare based on its deficits compared to other sector successes has been criticised (eg comparing culture in healthcare with culture in aviation; Macrae, 2015). The aim of this study was to identify where improvements can be made to the process of patient <b>safety</b> and risk <b>reporting,</b> based on NHS staff descriptions of identification and reporting and their experience of where the challenges lie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Due to few {{paediatric}} drug safety studies, knowledge on risks of drug treatment in children is limited. The knowledge {{needs to be}} increased to make proper risk-benefit analyses possible when treating paediatric patients with drugs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate drug groups commonly used in children concerning type and frequency of individual case <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> in children. Methods Number and type of individual case <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> in the 30 groups of drugs (5 th level ATC-code) most sold (number of defined daily doses) in outpatient treatment to children (Results The number of individual case <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> per million defined daily doses in children varied in the groups of drug between 0 and 24.

40|$|Aviation <b>safety</b> <b>reports,</b> such {{as those}} of the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and the Aviation <b>Safety</b> <b>Reporting</b> System (ASRS), provide a {{valuable}} record of safety incidents for industry analysts. Unfortunately, the sheer quantity of <b>safety</b> <b>reports</b> often makes it difficult to identify recurring safety issues and their causes. In response, NASA has explored the use of text classification techniques to automatically identify safety issues from the text of <b>safety</b> <b>reports.</b> One common approach for text classification is to use a statistical model of word occurrences in each report (often referred to as a bag of words), and use these models to train a classifier. We performed an experiment to evaluate whether simple semantic approaches could improve classification results with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier by factoring semantic relationships of words into the statistical model. Counter to our intuition, most of these semantic enhancements did not improve classification results. One method of combining meaningful words did show an improvement over the standard approach, however, and is presented along with the results of our study. I...|$|R
