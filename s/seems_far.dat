5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} the hormone calcitonin, which helps regulate blood calcium levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin {{in response to}} high blood calcium. Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> less essential than PTH, as calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have assumed that}} the {{surviving}} tower remnant equates to a distinctive part of Grose's engraving however the thickness at nearly 3 metres and the other features of this clearly later building together with map evidence suggests otherwise and in addition the OS map evidence suggests a typical square or oblong tower castle shaped building rather than a relatively unfortified laird's house with comparatively thin walls, many doors at ground level akin to buildings such as the Place of Auchinleck. The footprint of Corshill House {{as shown by the}} engraving also <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> too large for the knoll on which the surviving remnant of Old Corsehill Castle still stands. Oddly the 1779 map by Crawford does not indisputably show Corsehill as a ruin although by this time the lands of Cocklebie have extended across the once prestigious avenue of trees.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} {{negative reaction}} from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, {{due to its}} sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined {{that much of the}} book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy O'Brien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory – and silly – sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
2500|$|As expected, {{most of the}} localities listed are in the Hakkari and Urmi districts, but Amid and Van are {{interesting}} inclusions. [...] Both districts were dependent on the patriarch Eliya VIII earlier in the century, but their dependence around {{the middle of the}} 17th century on the Qudshanis patriarchate, probably because of Shemon XI's Catholic sympathies, is confirmed by several colophons. [...] With these two exceptions, the Qudshanis patriarchate covered roughly the same area in 1653 as it had in 1610. [...] The figure of 40,000 families <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> too high.|$|E
2500|$|General {{assessment}} of Tejada's scholarly standing <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> from agreed. Some point to his massive production {{and suggest that}} having been among greatest intellectuals of his time he led a school of his own, building a holistic [...] "sistema tejadiano" [...] or [...] "pensamiento tejadiano". Others consider him either mostly a law theorist or mostly a student of Hispanidad. His followers point also to his charming personality and acknowledging massive erudition, call him a genius monster. Others suggest {{that he was a}} little-minded, vindictive, impossible to deal with bigot of an overgrown ego, his career enabled by anti-democratic nature of the Francoist regime, dubbed [...] "reaccionario" [...] and the passion of his life, [...] "tradición española", referred to as [...] "ni es tradición ni es española". In the compromise version, he is either presented as notable but second-rate representative of Traditionalism or as an erudite eminent for some of his case studies.|$|E

But the phenomena now described, {{in conjunction with the}} confidence we may reasonably repose in M. Ampère's theory of magnetism, tend to throw doubt on such cases; for if magnetism depend upon the attraction of electrical currents, and if the powerful currents at first excited, both by volta-electric and magneto-electric induction, instantly and naturally cease (12. 28. 47.), causing at the same time an entire cessation of magnetic effects at the galvanometer needle, then there can be little or no expectation that any substances not partaking of the peculiar relation in which iron, nickel, and one or two other bodies, stand, should exhibit magneto-attractive powers. It <b>seems</b> <b>far</b> more probable, that the extremely feeble permanent effects observed have been due to traces of iron, or perhaps some other unrecognised cause not magnetic.|$|E
