40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} the safety, efficacy, {{and frequency of}} <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> axillary artery cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and compare it with other cannulation techniques. MethodsFrom January 2001 to October 2011, 308 adult patients were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at a single center. In 81 patients (26. 3 %), the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit was composed of an arterial inflow by a <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> sewn to the axillary artery. Of the 308 patients, 166 (53. 9 %) underwent femoral arterial cannulation and 61 (19. 8 %) underwent ascending aortic cannulation The pertinent variables and postprocedural events were retrospectively analyzed in this cohort of patients. ResultsThe most common complication in the axillary artery group was hyperperfusion syndrome of the ipsilateral upper extremity (n =  20, 24. 7 %), followed by bleeding from the arterial outflow graft (n =  14, 17. 3 %). Lower extremity ischemia and fasciotomy were more frequent after femoral arterial cannulation (n =  27, 16 %, and n =  18, 10. 8 %, respectively). The predictors for a poor in-hospital outcome for the entire group of patients were age and postoperative cerebral vascular accident. The cannulation method was not a predictor of in-hospital outcomes. ConclusionsExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation support with <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> axillary artery technique was more frequently associated with hyperperfusion syndrome than other cannulation sites.

40|$|Background: Postoperatively, signal {{changes of}} the reconstructed {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) graft on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images commonly occurs, which may be a cause for concern. The signal intensity changes are usually expressed by signal/noise quotient (SNQ) value, representing graft maturity. To date, {{little is known about}} the factors influencing the SNQ value of the reconstructed ACL graft. Purpose: To evaluate ACL graft SNQ value and associated factors after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Male patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using autograft or allograft tendon from September 2004 to September 2011 were randomly invited to take part in this investigation, including functional scores, physical examination, and MRI scan. The femoral <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> was fixed with Endobutton CL or Rigidfix pins, and the tibial <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> was fixed with a bio-intrafix. SNQ values of each graft were measured on MRI to represent graft maturity.

Advantages over femoral intra-aortic balloon pump therapy include reduced incidence of infection and enhanced patient mobility. We identified the patients who would benefit most from this therapy while awaiting heart transplantation. MethodsWe conducted a single-center, retrospective observational study to evaluate outcomes from axillary intra-aortic balloon pump therapy. These included hemodynamic parameters, duration of support, and success in bridging to transplant. We selected patients on the basis of history of sternotomy, elevated panel-reactive antibody, and small body habitus. Patients were made to ambulate aggressively beginning on postoperative day 1.

This study was carried out to compare two gingival graft procedures including connective tissue graft and graft with a combination of collagen sponge with platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin to increase the width and thickness of keratinized gingiva. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial 8 patients with bilateral inadequate width (≤ 2 mm) and thickness (≤ 1 mm) of keratinized gingiva on the buccal aspect of single-rooted teeth were selected. On the control side, connective tissue graft and on the test <b>side,</b> <b>graft</b> by combination of stypro+PRP+PRF were performed. After surgery, the measurements were repeated at 1, 2 and 3 months. Data was analyzed by Wilcoxon’s test to compare the 2 groups and Friedman’s test was used for comparisons within each group with SPSS 15 (α = 0. 05). Results: After 3 months there were no differences between test and control groups in relation to the width of keratinized (p value = 0. 317), attached gingival (p value = 0. 527), thickness of the graft (p value = 0. 05) and thickness of the keratinized layer (p value = 1).

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate this method’s efficiency regarding postoperative outcomes after the first 100 procedures. MethodsBetween July 2002 and October 2005, 100 patients underwent aortic surgery using carotid artery cannulation by a <b>side</b> <b>graft</b> for arterial return with a mean flow rate of 4. 6 ± 0. 5 L/min. There were 27 patients with acute and 2 with chronic type A aortic dissection. Sixteen patients had had prior cardiac surgery. During circulatory arrest, the arterial line was used for unilateral cerebral perfusion in moderate hypothermia (mean rectal temperature 28 °C ± 1. 6 °C) with a mean flow rate of 0. 85 ± 0. 2 L/min. ResultsCarotid artery cannulation offered adequate arterial return in all patients. In no case was a switch to another cannulation site necessary for arterial return. Furthermore, no complications related to the cannulation site were observed. One patient with acute dissection and 1 with chronic aneurysm died during the early postoperative course. Thus, 30 -day mortality was 2. 0 % for the whole group and 3. 7 % for the dissection group. Two patients with severe calcification of the aortic valve had strokes. There were no strokes in the dissection group, although there were preoperative signs of cerebral malperfusion in 4 patients. ConclusionsCarotid artery cannulation is a fast, safe, and efficient method of arterial cannulation even in very obese patients. In addition, it simplifies the procedure of unilateral cerebral perfusion through the arterial line during circulatory arrest, making it completely unnecessary to interrupt cerebral perfusion...|$|E

Methods The front and back of the neck, {{the front and back}} of the chest up to the midline and the whole affected upper limb were sterilized while the patient was in the lateral position; the patient was next turned into the supine position, the plexus explored anteriorly and the grafts were placed; the patient was then turned again into the lateral position, and a posterior cervical laminectomy was done. The grafts were retrieved posteriorly and <b>side</b> <b>grafted</b> to the anterior cord. Using this approach, 5 patients suffering from complete traumatic brachial plexus palsy, 4 adults and 1 obstetric case were operated upon and followed up for 2 years. 2 were C 5, 6 ruptures and C 7, 8 T 1 avulsions. 3 were C 5, 6, 7, 8 T 1 avulsions. C 5, 6 ruptures were grafted and all avulsions were cord implanted. Results Surgery in complete avulsions led to Grade 4 improvement in shoulder abduction/flexion and elbow flexion. Cocontractions occurred between the lateral deltoid and biceps on active shoulder abduction. No cocontractions occurred after surgery in C 5, 6 ruptures and C 7, 8 T 1 avulsions, muscle power improvement extended into the forearm and hand; pain disappeared. Limitations include spontaneous recovery despite MRI appearance of avulsions, fallacies in determining intraoperative avulsions (wrong diagnosis, wrong level); small sample size; no controls rule out superiority of this technique versus other direct cord reimplantation techniques or other neurotization procedures; intra- and interobserver variability in testing muscle power and cocontractions. Conclusion Through providing proper exposure to the brachial plexus and to the cervical cord, the single stage combined anterior (first) and posterior (second) approach might stimulate brachial plexus surgeons to go more for direct cord implantation. In this study, it allowed for placing <b>side</b> <b>grafts</b> along an extensive donor recipient area by end-to-side, side-to-side grafting neurorrhaphy and thus improved results.

30|$|In the {{presence}} of extensive atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta, alternative sites are used for cannulation or surgical <b>side</b> <b>grafts.</b> Axillary or subclavian arteries are used [4] due to lower incidence of athero-emboli and lower risk of micro-emboli during bypass [8]. Assessment of the anatomy of these vessels, including variations, atherosclerosis and stenosis is essential prior to surgery. Axillary artery cannulation is performed by clamping {{the base of the}} innominate artery with antegrade cerebral perfusion through the right common carotid artery and perfusion of contralateral cerebral hemisphere through an intact Circle of Willis. Presence of a bovine variant (common origin of brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery) enables bilateral antegrade common carotid antegrade perfusion with a single cannulation, regardless of the integrity of Circle of Willis. A left-sided arch with aberrant right subclavian artery or a right-sided arch are not ideal for right axillary cannulation, due to perfusion of descending aorta in the first scenario and separate origin of right subclavian and right common carotid arteries in the second scenario [4].|$|R

In vitro blood leakage through these bilayered grafts was significantly reduced compared with a high-porosity graft. All grafts had an excellent in vivo outcome, with perfect patency and no thrombosis. Cell invasion and neovascularization were significantly reduced in the grafts with a low-porosity layer on the adventitial side, and {{there was no significant difference}} between the grafts in endothelialization rate or intimal hyperplasia. By tailoring the microarchitecture of biodegradable vascular prostheses, it is therefore possible to optimize the scaffold for tissue regeneration while preventing blood leakage, and thus facilitating applicability in the clinic...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the rigidity of polymer backbones on the side-chain crystallization and phase transition behavior was systematically investigated {{by a combination of}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). DSC investigation indicated that the crystallization number of alkyl carbon atoms of the <b>side</b> chains <b>grafted</b> onto the rigid polymer backbone, poly(p-benzamide) (PBA), is much lower than that of the alkyl carbon atoms of the <b>side</b> chains <b>grafted</b> onto the flexible polymer backbone, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), implying that the conformational state of the polymer backbones has a strong effect on the side-chain crystallization behavior in comblike polymers. WAXD and FTIR results proved that these two comblike polymers pack into hexagonal (PBA 18 C) and orthorhombic (PEI 18 C) crystals, respectively, depending on the adjusting ability of the polymer backbones for particular conformational states. It was also found that the presence of the crystalline-amorphous interphase (δ = 31. 6 ppm) in PBA 18 C detected by solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy {{can be attributed to the}} rigid PBA backbone, which restricts the mobility of the alkyl side chains. The conformation effect of the polymer backbones and the packing mode variation of alkyl side chains are explicitly discussed in terms of molecular chain mobility and theory of macromolecular chain conformation.

30|$|Due to poor bone quality, the tibial <b>graft</b> <b>side</b> is {{referred}} to as “weak spot” in ACL-reconstruction (Brand Jr et al., 2000) emphasizing the need for improvement. Therefore our study focused on this aspect. Two suspensory devices were evaluated due to their capacity to withstand cyclic displacement and ultimate failure loads after ACL reconstruction in an biomechanical in vitro study.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} transport distraction with costochondral graft in {{the reconstruction}} of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) with disc preservation. Materials and Methods: Bilateral condylectomies with disc preservation were conducted in 12 adult goats. Transport distraction of the mandibular ramus was performed on 1 <b>side</b> and costochondral <b>graft</b> on the other side. Jaw movements, TMJ healing, and condylar remodeling were assessed by clinical, radiologic, and histologic examinations. Results: Transport distraction and costochondral graft established a new condyle separating from the preserved disc with a joint space. Both techniques showed {{no significant difference in}} ankylosis scores up to 24 weeks. Signs of calcification were not noted in the transport distraction or costochondral <b>graft</b> <b>side.</b> No significant change of maximal jaw movements was found at any time point from 2 to 24 weeks. Conclusions: Distraction osteogenesis is an effective reconstruction method for TMJ reconstruction. No significant difference between these 2 techniques in reconstruction of the TMJ was noted. © 2011 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Further {{insights}} into the composite interactive processes of topically applied agents and percutaneous absorption and metabolism by functional skin in vivo have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a model system wherein the blood flow to and from the skin is independent but experimentally accessible. Utilizing microsurgical techniques, split-thickness skin grafting with syngeneic skin grafts, and the congenitally athymic (nude) rat, a skin sandwich flap system has been generated that has an independent but accessible vasculature and thus fills this void. We describe the methodology that has been developed to create the flap and present experiments that: (a) demonstrate a lack of significant collateral circulation; (b) quantify the microcirculation of the skin sandwich flap, host <b>side,</b> and <b>graft</b> <b>side</b> at various times during and after the flap has been generated, and note that blood flow to the flap is basically unchanged from host skin; (c) demonstrate the utility of the system in measuring the amount of [14 C]benzoic acid that appears in the flap when deposited on the surface in volatile and nonvolatile vehicles as a function of time; and (d) demonstrate the fact that the flap can be reused, and that the total amount of [14 C]benzoic acid absorbed across skin does not change in a substantial way as the flap ages...|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{failure of the}} Two-Doubled group was consistently located at the tibial <b>side</b> of the <b>graft</b> where no tendon tissue was wrapped around suspensory suture, instead, the whip stitch was looped around the suspensory suture. In seven cases, the whipstitch broke at the tibial end of the graft. Two grafts failed when the whipstitch slid through the tendon, and one graft failed when the whipstitch broke at its interface with the suspensory suture.|$|R
