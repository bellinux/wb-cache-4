40|$|The {{original}} Wadati’s graphical {{method for}} the earthquake hypocentre location is already presented in analytical form (Allegretti et al. 1984). However, the described method {{was restricted to}} the use of the data of four <b>seismological</b> <b>stations.</b> In this paper the equations (Eq. 1.) of seismic wave propagation are solved for the hypocentre coordinates x, y, z and the constant c = Vp Vs/(Vp-Vs) by the use of the least squares method. Providing that approximate values of x, y, z and c are known (usually it is sufficient to approximate the starting epicentre coordinates x’, y’, with the coordinates of the station with the minimal ts-tp time) the least squares method is applied to the error equations (Eqs. 4.). Due to the high rate of convergence it is sufficient to perform only a few iterations. This enables the use of the greater number of <b>seismological</b> <b>stations</b> and, as a consequence, the greater precision of the results. The error estimation is also possible giving the quantitative measure of the precision of the results obtained. It is also, shown, that Wadati’s method could be extended to include the seismic station height differences. This may be applied in the rock bursts investigations too...|$|R

Visitors are introduced to the evolutionary history of the volcanic activity in the Greek area, impressive forms of quartz minerals and rocks, skulls moulders of significant extinct primates from Greece and Lesvos, tools made of flint from the Stone Age.
