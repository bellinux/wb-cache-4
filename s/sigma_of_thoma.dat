25|$|The {{question}} also arises as {{to various}} sects' usage of other works attributed to Thomas and {{their relation to}} this work. The Book <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> the Contender, also from Nag Hammadi, is foremost among these, but the extensive Acts <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> provides the mythological connections. The short and comparatively straightforward Apocalypse <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> has no immediate connection with the synoptic gospels, while the canonical Jude – if the name {{can be taken to}} refer to Judas Thomas Didymus – certainly attests to early intra-Christian conflict. The Infancy Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Thomas,</b> shorn <b>of</b> its mythological connections, is difficult to connect specifically to our gospel, but the Acts <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> contains the Hymn of the Pearl whose content is reflected in the Psalms <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> found in Manichaean literature. These psalms, which otherwise reveal Mandaean connections, also contain material overlapping the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Thomas.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1855, Thomas Cowan Bell {{became one}} of the seven founders <b>of</b> <b>Sigma</b> Chi at the age of 23. He was {{considered}} to be an [...] "elder statesman" [...] of the fraternity along with fellow founder Daniel William Cooper, who was 25. As a student at Miami, Bell lived in the Oxford home of his Aunt Lizzie. Because all of {{the other members of the}} Fraternity at one time or another lived in Aunt Lizzie's place or took meals there, the house became known as [...] "the first Chapter house <b>of</b> <b>Sigma</b> Chi." [...] According to his fraternity, Bell is best known for his [...] "... exemplification of the qualities of learning and friendship." [...] In 1933, Sigma Chi erected and dedicated the Founders' Memorial Monument to him in the San Francisco National Cemetery, where he is buried. After his career in education, Bell retired to Oakland, California and renewed his connection to the Sigma Chi fraternity. He did this through the Alpha Beta chapter at the University of California at Berkeley. Bell attended Sigma Chi's semi-centennial celebration in Oxford Ohio in 1905, along the three other surviving founders: James Parks Caldwell, Daniel William Cooper, and Benjamin Piatt Runkle. Bell is now the namesake <b>of</b> the <b>Thomas</b> Cowan Bell Scholastic Foundation, located in San Jose, California, which awards college scholarships to both members <b>of</b> the <b>Sigma</b> Chi Fraternity and students of San Jose State University. The foundation is funded almost exclusively by Sigma Chi's alumni. Bell is also the namesake <b>of</b> the <b>Thomas</b> Cowan Bell Sigma Chi Scholarship for both members and non-members <b>of</b> <b>Sigma</b> Chi at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln that are believed to exemplify the 7 pillars <b>of</b> <b>Sigma</b> Chi's Jordan Standard by being a man of good character, a student of fair ability, with ambitious purposes, a congenial disposition, possessed of good morals, and having a high sense of honor and deep sense of personal responsibility. Chapters <b>of</b> <b>Sigma</b> Chi with the most active alumni donors are given the name of [...] "Bell Chapters" [...] in honor <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> Cowan Bell.|$|R
