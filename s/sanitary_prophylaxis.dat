40|$|Two highly {{contagious}} diseases, Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox, constitute main constraints {{to small}} ruminants production {{in many countries}} in Asia, the Near and Middle East and Africa. Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known {{in the past as}} goat plague, is a highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild small ruminants. It is caused by a virus which belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of Paramyxoviridae family: the Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV). It is a rinderpest-like infection of goats and sheep characterized by erosive stomatitis, enteritis, pneumonia and death. Economically, it is the most important small ruminant disease in areas where it is endemic. In the same regions, there is a second contagious viral disease, Sheep and goat pox. The responsible pathogens, the sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV), cause acute to sub acute disease of infected sheep and goats respectively. The clinical signs of infection may include generalized pox lesions throughout the skin and mucous membranes, persistent fever, lymphadenitis, and often a focal pneumonia and nodules lesions distributed uniformly throughout the lungs. There is no curative medical treatment against these two viral diseases. Therefore, the only way of tackling them is by means of sanitary and medical prophylaxis. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> to be effective needs the existence of efficient veterinary services, the implementation of animal movement controls with sometimes the stamping out policy. The cost needed for the effective implementation of these means in a short period is too high for most of countries where these diseases are endemic. Therefore the only way for effective control of PPR and sheep and goat pox in those countries is the medical prophylaxis, i. e. the vaccination. Currently, efficient attenuated vaccines exist against each of these diseases. Unfortunately, in most cases they are used only in case of outbreaks to limit their extension. The cost of the logistic needed for systematic vaccination campaigns of small ruminants against either PPR or capripox may be too high for countries if only the individual economic value of goat or sheep, excluding their social value, is considered. The way to cut down this cost is the use of polyvalent vaccine which would enable, in one shot, the protection of animals against more than one economic important disease. The objective of our thesis work was to develop a recombinant thermostable (a characteristic linked to capripoxes) vaccine {{that could be used to}} protect sheep and goats against both PPR and capripox and thereby that would contribute to cut down the cost of vaccination campaigns. For that, the complementary DNA, cDNA, corresponding to the gene of PPRV immune protective proteins, the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) proteins were inserted into the genome of the attenuated strain capripox virus strain KS 1. Such a recombinant vaccine may be thermotolerant, a characteristic of poxviruses and this may improve the quality of the vaccine for its use in hot climate conditions. Capripox viruses are highly host-specific microorganisms. They are not pathogenic to human and their host range is limited to cattle and small ruminants and possibly buffaloes. Therefore they constitute an ideal and safe vector for the development of recombinant vaccines for use against ruminant diseases. The present manuscript in which we report on the results we have obtained during our thesis work is composed of the following different parts: a general introduction, a literature review of PPR and capripox viruses, the construction of two recombinant vaccines FPPR/Capripox and HPPR/Capripox, the comparison of efficacy of three poxvirus promoters in HPPR...|$|E

Unlike previous prevention initiatives that focused on sanitary control of prostitution, the Society promoted the creation of dispensaries for medical care for the sick, and the dissemination of knowledge through lectures and printed propaganda. This article analyzes the ideas that led to the founding of the Society, the main messages which it sought to spread, obstacles and criticism it faced, and the causes that led to its dissolution in 1923. The article shows that science and morality were two core elements that the Society sought to promote, since its members assumed that venereal diseases concerned to public health and morals, and that they could be prevented by the control of the will and passions, and if necessary, treated with the help of qualified physicians...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDiarrhea {{represents}} one of the most frequent disorders in dogs. In puppies, degradation of feces quality is associated with a reduced daily weight gain and an increased risk of death. Prevention of diarrhea in puppies requires a global approach encompassing enteropathogens, environment and management practices especially when housed in groups. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine prevalence of enteropathogens in puppies in breeding kennels and to identify risk factors of diarrhea. Two hundred and sixty six puppies (between 5 and 14 weeks of age) from 29 French breeding kennels were included. For each kennel, data about environment, management of the kennel and puppies’ characteristics (age, sex and breed) were collected. For each puppy, fecal consistency and fecal excretion of enteropathogens (viruses and parasites) was evaluated. At least one enteropathogen was identified in 77. 1 % of puppies and 24. 8 % of puppies presented abnormal feces. The main risk factor of weaning diarrhea was fecal excretion of canine parvovirus type 2 (odds ratio= 5; confidence interval 95 %: 1. 7 – 14. 7). A targeted <b>sanitary</b> and medical <b>prophylaxis</b> against canine parvovirus type 2 should be implemented to decrease risk of weaning diarrhea...|$|R
