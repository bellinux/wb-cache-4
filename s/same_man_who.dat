5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E
25|$|Several {{sets were}} built in Paris for the street outside 221B Baker Street and the flat itself, {{both of which were}} {{designed}} by Michael Weight, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> built the Festival of Britain 221B exhibit. There were a number of other sets built for a variety of locations and then redressed as necessary (homes, Scotland Yard, shops, parks, offices, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In a {{twist of}} fate William Watson, who {{finished}} a distant fourth in this by-election with just 4.6% of the vote, would be elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Fremantle at the 1922 election {{on the back of}} preferences from Nationalist candidate William Hedges, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had also contested the by-election and had previously been the member for Fremantle.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 {{the railway}} was closed, after seventy years of operation. The railway was {{dismantled}} {{by order of}} the Ministry of Public Works and {{carried out by the}} <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> drove the locomotives. The abrupt manner in which the procedures occurred remained in the memory of the inhabitants of the area.|$|R
25|$|On October 10, 2006, the {{transcripts}} of the 911 calls made October 2, 2006, {{in connection with}} the attack were released. The callers identified in {{the transcripts}} were Amos Smoker, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> telephoned 911 reporting the armed invader at the school, Roberts, and Roberts' wife Marie. In some cases the transcript indicates the line went dead because the call was transferred to state police and was not recorded by Lancaster County.|$|E
25|$|He was {{succeeded by}} Kenny Dalglish, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had {{replaced}} {{him as a}} player at Liverpool 20 years earlier, but Newcastle were unable to win the title and finished {{second place in the}} same season, and in the following season finished outside the top ten in the Premier League, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the 2001-02 season, when they finished fourth under Bobby Robson.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who made}} their way up through the Valtournanche {{to the foot of}} the {{mountain}} were few in number. W. A. B. Coolidge, a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Zürich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the Valais up the Visp valley to Zermatt. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the Breithorn; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had gone with de Saussure to the top of the Klein Matterhorn in 1792.|$|E
60|$|Panic-stricken troops recover slowly, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{have just}} disgraced {{themselves}} by cowardice, {{as if to}} wipe out the memory of their fault, will sometimes run straight into the opposite extreme of insubordination. So it was now; and the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had thrown away their weapons and been hauled, feet foremost, into the Good Hope, began to cry out upon their leaders, and demand that some one should be punished.|$|R
50|$|To enable {{what was}} going on in each of the provinces to be {{reported}} and known more speedily and promptly, he at first stationed young men at short intervals along the military roads, and afterwards post-chaises. The latter has seemed the more convenient arrangement, since the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> bring the dispatches from any place can, if occasion demands, be questioned as well.|$|R

25|$|After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus {{is taken}} to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had {{previously}} ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, {{because he had been}} hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
500|$|It was, however, {{difficult}} for the Air Force to do otherwise. Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from {{the western side of}} the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. [...] The depth of penetration by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had the last word in the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly [...] "neutral" [...] Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attaché within Project 404, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.|$|E
60|$|Another {{thing was}} done {{by some of the}} <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> framed the Constitution, and {{afterwards}} adopted as their own the act by the first Congress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were members, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories. Thus the <b>same</b> <b>men,</b> the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong.|$|R

2500|$|The priesthoods {{of public}} {{religion}} were held {{by members of}} the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to {{separation of church and state}} in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul.|$|R
500|$|On August 9, 2016, a man {{posted a}} YouTube video that {{subsequently}} went viral, {{in which he}} said that he was an independent researcher wishing to speak to Donald Trump. The next day, a man, suspected to be the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had posted the YouTube video, climbed the outside of Trump Tower from the 5th to the 21st floors. The man was aid climbing using industrial suction cups. During the incident, the police attempted to [...] "safely isolate" [...] the climber, breaking and removing windows to try to capture him. After climbing for 2 hours and 45 minutes, he was apprehended by the NYPD Emergency Service Units (ESU) at the 21st floor of the tower. The man identified himself as Stephen Rogata, a 20-year-old Virginia resident. Rogata was arrested for endangerment and criminal trespassing and taken to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric evaluation.|$|E
500|$|His {{years at}} Glasgow left {{a mark on}} history that can be {{compared}} favourably with any previous or future bishop. Jocelin commissioned his namesake Jocelin of Furness, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had written the Life of St. Waltheof, to write a Life of St. Kentigern, a task all the more necessary because, after 1159, the Papacy claimed the right to canonise saints. Kentigern, or Mungo as he is popularly known, was the saint traditionally associated with the see of Glasgow, and his status therefore reflected on Glasgow as a church and cult-centre. There had already been a cathedral at Glasgow before Jocelin's episcopate. The idea that the ecclesiastical establishment before Jocelin was simply a small church with a larger Gaelic or British monastic establishment has been discredited by scholars. Jocelin did, though, expand the cathedral significantly. As the Chronicle of Melrose reports for 1181, Jocelin [...] "gloriously enlarged the church of St Kentigern". However, more work was created for the builders when, sometime between the years 1189 and 1195, {{there was a fire}} at the cathedral. Jocelin thus had to commission another rebuilding effort. The new cathedral was dedicated, according to the Chronicle of Melrose, on 6 July 1197. It was built in the Romanesque manner, and although little survives of it today, it is thought to have been influenced by the cathedral of Lund, the archbishop of which had consecrated Jocelin as bishop.|$|E
500|$|On a late evening, Allan Gray {{arrives at}} an inn {{close to the}} village of Courtempierre and he rents a room to sleep. Gray is awakened {{suddenly}} by an old man, who enters the room and leaves a square packet on Gray's table; [...] "To be opened upon my death" [...] is written on the wrapping paper. Gray takes the package and walks outside. Shadows guide him to an old castle, where he sees the shadows dancing and wandering on their own. Gray also sees an elderly woman (later identified as Marguerite Chopin) and encounters another old man (later identified as the village doctor). Gray leaves the castle and walks to a manor. Looking through one of the windows, Gray sees the Lord of the manor, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> gave him the package earlier. The man is suddenly murdered by gunshot. Gray is let into the house by servants, who rush to the aid of the fallen man but it is too late to save him. The servants ask Gray to stay the night. Gisèle, the youngest daughter of the now deceased Lord of the manor, takes Gray to the library and tells him that her sister, Léone, is gravely ill. Just then they see Léone walking outside. They follow her, and find her unconscious on the ground with fresh bite wounds. They have her carried inside. Gray remembers the parcel and opens it. Inside is a book about horrific demons called Vampyrs.|$|E

50|$|The 26 {{homes in}} the {{district}} represent {{some of the finest}} work and craftsmanship, both interior and exterior, being done in Denver just before and after 1900. They were designed by Denver Architects - the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were responsible for many other fine landmarks throughout the city. The homes of Humboldt Island have been occupied by leaders in the fields of law, government, and industry since their construction.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where {{a professor in the}} hall (the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> appeared in their previous single's video [...] "Black Magic") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket over her shoulder and eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall off the chair.|$|E
500|$|In Final Fantasy games, players {{command a}} party of {{characters}} as they progress through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating opponents. Enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring, a trend which changed in Final FantasyXI and Final FantasyXII. The player issues combat orders—like [...] "Fight", [...] "Magic", and [...] "Item"—to individual characters via a menu-driven interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to Final FantasyXI, battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. Final FantasyIV introduced the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual time-keeping system. Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until Final FantasyX, which implemented the [...] "Conditional Turn-Based" [...] (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. Final FantasyXI adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. Final FantasyXII continued this gameplay with the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] system. Final Fantasy XIIIs combat system, designed by the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> worked on X, was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The latest installment to the franchise, Final Fantasy XV, introduces a new [...] "Open Combat" [...] system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the [...] "Open Combat" [...] system (OCS) allows players {{to take on a}} fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a [...] "Tactical" [...] Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the Bailey Gatzert {{inspired}} several other sternwheelers, including the 1897 Arrow Lakes, British Columbia sternwheeler Rossland and, much later, the M/V Columbia Gorge, launched at Hood River, Oregon in 1983. [...] Rossland, {{said to have been}} one of the most elegant steamboats ever built, was designed by Captain James W. Troup, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been on board Bailey Gatzert when it was launched in 1890.|$|E
5000|$|A marked {{feature of}} the church complex are the ducal apartments, which were later used as the parish school {{at the behest of}} the Duke. These apartments were renovated and in 1968 were opened again for church use.

[...] The masons were the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> built Drumlanrig Castle.|$|R
50|$|Two {{witnesses}} who approached Dominic Almelor of ABS-CBN News claimed that Delos Santos was blindfolded {{by the two}} men and forced to hold a gun, fire it, and run. Another witness who approached Saleema Refran of GMA News claimed that Delos Santos begged for his life before getting shot. Afterwards, the shooters approached the witness {{and asked him if}} he knew the victim, which he denied. The witness later confirmed that the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were filmed inside the barangay hall reporting the alleged shootout were the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> shot Delos Santos.|$|R

Body o' me, but he kicked and plunged for all that he was three-quarters stunned.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1868, the Willamette Steamboat Company had Cowlitz rebuilt in Portland by Si Smith, the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{had built}} the vessel on the Tualatin river eleven years previously.

[...] The Willamette Steamboat company renamed the vessel Wenat.|$|E
2500|$|The Frank T. Lang Building, at Metropolitan Avenue and 69th Street, was {{constructed}} in 1904. It is named after Frank Lang, the building's namesake, who built mausoleums and monuments.
