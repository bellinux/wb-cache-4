5|$|Akishio {{was laid}} down in Kobe by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on 15 April 1983, {{launched}} on 22 January 1985, and commissioned on 5 March 1986. Upon being commissioned, on 5 March 1986, Akishio was immediately assigned to the 1st <b>Submarine</b> Squadron of the 1st <b>Submarine</b> Flotilla of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. On 8 June 1990, she was reassigned to the 5th <b>Submarine</b> Squadron, which was {{also part of the}} 1st <b>Submarine</b> Flotilla. Her crew was trained by American submariners, from September to October, in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Indian naval crews earlier {{trained to}} operate the <b>submarine</b> near St Petersburg and another group of sailors was {{expected}} to arrive in Vladivostok in late 2008 for sea trials. The training of the crew was viewed as crucial to India's own nuclear <b>submarine</b> programme, known as the Arihant class <b>submarine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The German Type IXA <b>submarine</b> was a sub-class of the German Type IX <b>submarine</b> {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1937 and 1938. These U-boats were {{designed}} between 1935 and 1936 and {{were intended to}} be fairly large ocean-going submarines. The inspiration for the Type IXA <b>submarine</b> came from the German Type IA <b>submarine,</b> which had a similar diving depth and identical submerged horsepower.|$|E
5000|$|Project 949 <b>submarines</b> {{were the}} largest cruise missile <b>submarines</b> in service, until the [...] {{ballistic}} missile <b>submarines</b> {{were converted to}} carry cruise missiles in 2007. They are the fourth largest class of <b>submarines</b> in displacement and length. Only the [...] Soviet/Russian <b>submarines,</b> the American Ohio-class ballistic missile <b>submarines</b> and the Russian s are larger.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} major types of <b>submarines</b> in the United States Navy: {{ballistic}} missile <b>submarines,</b> attack <b>submarines,</b> and cruise missile <b>submarines.</b> All <b>submarines</b> in the U.S. Navy are nuclear-powered. Ballistic subs {{have a single}} strategic mission of carrying nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Attack <b>submarines</b> have several tactical missions, including sinking ships and subs, launching cruise missiles, and gathering intelligence.|$|R
50|$|The company {{completed}} 26 <b>submarines</b> for the US Navy, designed two US Navy <b>submarines</b> {{that were}} built in other yards, and built several other <b>submarines</b> for civilian use or that were not accepted by the Navy. Some of the <b>submarines</b> built by Lake for the Navy included several G-class, L-class, N-class, O-class, and R-class <b>submarines.</b> The company designed the Imperial Russian Navy's Osetr-class <b>submarines,</b> {{the first of which}} was Lake's Protector. The Kaiman-class <b>submarines</b> were also designed for Russia.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Submarine</b> Division {{was based}} in Kotor, and {{consisted}} of the <b>submarine</b> tender Hvar and four ageing submarines of British or French manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Thyssen Nordseewerke, another German company, {{offered their}} TR-1700-class <b>submarine.</b> Like the Type 209, the TR-1700 was an export-only <b>submarine</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Upon the submarine's {{return to}} Kure, Hashimoto was {{detached}} and {{assigned to the}} advanced course at <b>Submarine</b> School on 1 February 1942, to prepare him for command of a <b>submarine.</b> Graduating from this course on 30 June, Hashimoto was given command of <b>submarine</b> Ro-31, a coastal defense vessel. For the remainder of 1942, Hashimoto operated his ship in home waters off Yokosuka training crews and trying new equipment and doing research {{for the development of}} Japanese <b>submarine</b> doctrine. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 November. In 1943, he was given command of <b>submarine</b> I-158 for coastal defense, and later in the year was given command of <b>submarine</b> Ro-44 for the same duties.|$|E
5000|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy {{operated}} the most varied fleet of <b>submarines</b> of any navy, including Kaiten crewed torpedoes, midget <b>submarines</b> ( [...] and es), medium-range <b>submarines,</b> purpose-built supply <b>submarines</b> and long-range fleet <b>submarines.</b> They also had <b>submarines</b> {{with the highest}} submerged speeds during World War II (s) and <b>submarines</b> that could carry multiple aircraft (s). They were also equipped {{with one of the}} most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled Type 95. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to utilize its <b>submarines</b> for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.|$|R
50|$|Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij {{appointed}} PSC Naval Dockyard {{as their}} partner and ambitiously brought 2 former Royal Netherlands Navy <b>submarines</b> Tijgerhaai and Zwaardvis {{in anticipation of}} the Royal Malaysian Navy’s planned purchase of <b>submarines.</b> The 2 <b>submarines</b> were to have been refurbished and used as training <b>submarines</b> while the new <b>submarines</b> are built in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|The Toti {{class were}} <b>submarines</b> {{built for the}} Italian Navy in the 1960s. They were the first <b>submarines</b> {{designed}} and built in Italy since World War II. These boats were small and designed as [...] "hunter killer" [...] anti-submarine <b>submarines.</b> They are comparable to the German Type 205 <b>submarines</b> and the French Aréthuse class <b>submarines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Apart from a work-up {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy <b>submarine.</b> Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German <b>submarine</b> was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the Italian auxiliary <b>submarine</b> chaser O 97 / Margherita, the Italian merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the Italian tugs Genova and Iseo, the Italian sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary <b>submarine</b> chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, the Italian tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the Italian auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{uncertain}} which <b>submarine</b> had launched the torpedoes. Its periscope remained visible as lifeboats were lowered. The <b>submarine</b> waited until the lifeboats were well clear before firing a coup de grâce at 9:31 am. Irish Plane, Irish Rose and Irish Ash responded to the SOS. The survivors were located by Irish Plane at 4:20 pm.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking <b>submarine</b> moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the <b>submarine</b> was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the <b>submarine</b> to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class <b>submarine</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E

50|$|All {{current and}} planned U.S. Navy <b>submarines</b> are nuclear-powered, as only nuclear {{propulsion}} {{allows for the}} combination of stealth and long duration, high-speed sustained underwater movement that makes modern nuclear <b>submarines</b> so vital to a modern blue-water navy. The U.S. Navy operates three types: ballistic missile <b>submarines,</b> guided missile <b>submarines,</b> and attack <b>submarines.</b> U.S. Navy (nuclear) ballistic missile <b>submarines</b> carry the stealthiest leg of the U.S. strategic triad (the other legs are the land-based U.S. strategic missile force and the air-based U.S. strategic bomber force). These <b>submarines</b> have only one mission: to carry and, if called upon, to launch the Trident nuclear missile. The primary missions of attack and guided missile <b>submarines</b> in the U.S. Navy are peacetime engagement, surveillance and intelligence, special operations, precision strikes, {{and control of the}} seas. To these, attack <b>submarines</b> also add the battlegroup operations mission. Attack and guided missile <b>submarines</b> have several tactical missions, including sinking ships and other subs, launching cruise missiles, gathering intelligence, and assisting in special operations.|$|R
50|$|Since 1964, the <b>submarines</b> {{have been}} active with Pakistan Navy, and five active-duty diesel {{electric}} <b>submarines</b> and three midget <b>submarines,</b> MG110, are in SSGN command.|$|R
5|$|Back on Earth, O'Neill and Teal'c {{penetrate}} the <b>submarine</b> and find {{and destroy the}} original Replicator. When the other Replicators take full control of the <b>submarine,</b> O'Neill orders the forces outside to destroy the <b>submarine</b> and prepares for the end, but Thor beams the team onto his ship before the explosion occurs. With the imminent Replicator threat over, Thor promises that when the Asgard defeat the Replicators, he will come to assist Earth {{in the war against}} the Goa'uld.|$|E
5|$|Bond dives {{after the}} <b>submarine,</b> boards it, and frees Jones. Following a fight, the <b>submarine</b> hits {{the bottom of}} the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine's reactor. Bond and Jones escape from the <b>submarine,</b> leaving the flooded reactor to {{detonate}} safely underwater.|$|E
5|$|Despite Turtle’s shortcomings, Bushnell’s {{invention}} marked {{an important}} milestone in <b>submarine</b> technology. The American inventor Robert Fulton conceived of his <b>submarine</b> Nautilus {{in the first}} years of the nineteenth century and took it to Europe when the United States proved largely uninterested in the design. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America, faced with a similar situation to that of the colonies during the War of Independence, developed an operational <b>submarine</b> CSS H.L. Hunley, whose destruction of the USS Housatonic in Charleston Harbor in February 1864 was the first successful <b>submarine</b> attack in history. By the early-twentieth century, the world’s navies were beginning to adopt submarines in larger numbers. Like Bushnell’s design, these boats mimicked the natural forms of marine animals the in their hull designs. As one contemporary historian of submarines observed in 1901, the evolution of modern <b>submarine</b> evolved from the whale, which he deemed a “submarine made by nature out of a mammal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Submarines</b> and torpedoes: Iran {{has three}} KILO-class {{diesel-electric}} <b>submarines,</b> {{as well as}} seven YONO-class, and one NAHANG-class, midget <b>submarines.</b> These <b>submarines</b> are most likely intended {{to be used for}} mine-laying, as well as special and anti-shipping operations. Iran also has a recently expanded torpedo capability.|$|R
50|$|The {{first eight}} <b>submarines</b> had their home ports at Bangor, Washington, {{to replace the}} <b>submarines</b> {{carrying}} the Polaris A3 missile that were then being decommissioned. The remaining ten <b>submarines</b> originally had their home ports at Kings Bay, Georgia, replacing the Poseidon and Trident Backfit <b>submarines</b> of the Atlantic Fleet. During {{the conversion of the}} first four <b>submarines</b> to SSGNs (see below), five of the <b>submarines,</b> , , , , and , were transferred from Kings Bay to Bangor. Further transfers occur as the strategic weapons goals of the United States change.|$|R
50|$|School of Advanced Undersea Warfare (SAUW) was {{established}} in Dec 2006 inside the premises of INS Satavahana, to train the crew of <b>submarines</b> of the nuclear <b>submarines.</b> The training for the Kalvari Class <b>submarines</b> the P 75 (I) class of <b>submarines</b> is also being set up here.|$|R
5|$|Directions Techniques Des Constructions Naval of France {{originally}} supplied {{a design}} modified from the Agosta class, but the submission review board did not view this favourably, as the <b>submarine</b> {{was of the}} same vintage as the Oberons.

5|$|Fearless was {{converted}} into a <b>submarine</b> depot ship shortly afterwards and briefly deployed to Russia later in the year. She later became the flotilla leader of the 12th <b>Submarine</b> Flotilla (SF), initially based in Scapa Flow, but later in Rosyth. In early 1918, she accidentally rammed and sank one <b>submarine</b> from a different flotilla {{as part of an}} incident that sardonically {{came to be known as}} the Battle of May Island. The ship survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
50|$|The Stickleback class <b>submarines</b> were midget <b>submarines</b> of the Royal Navy {{initially}} ordered as improved {{versions of}} the older XE class <b>submarines.</b> They were designed to allow British defences to practice defending against midget <b>submarines</b> since it was theorised that the Soviets had or could develop such craft.|$|R
5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a {{proposed}} class of nuclear-powered radar picket <b>submarines.</b> A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket <b>submarines.</b> The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class <b>submarines</b> and eight nuclear <b>submarines.</b> With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket <b>submarines</b> for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket <b>submarines</b> each.|$|R
25|$|The Archer class <b>submarines</b> were {{designed}} and built by Kockums AB as single-hull, double compartment <b>submarines</b> optimised to reduce noise and magnetic signature. The two pressure-tight compartments also enhance safety and survivability of the crew. The <b>submarines</b> {{were designed}} {{to operate in the}} shallow waters of the Baltic Sea and are therefore also optimised for operation in Singapore waters, which have similar depth profiles.The Archer class <b>submarines</b> are also equipped with Stirling AIP engines. This enables the <b>submarines</b> to have longer submerged endurance and lower noise signature, enhancing the stealth capability of the <b>submarines.</b> The advanced sonar system allows the <b>submarines</b> to detect contacts at a further distance, while the torpedo system has a better target acquisition capability, which allows the <b>submarines</b> to engage contacts at a longer range.|$|R
5|$|German <b>submarine</b> U-255 was a Type VIIC U-boat {{that served}} in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The <b>submarine</b> was laid down on 21 December 1940 at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen-Vegesack, {{launched}} on 8 October 1941 and commissioned on 29 November 1941 {{under the command}} of Kapitänleutnant Reinhart Reche.|$|E
5|$|German <b>submarine</b> U-37 was a Type IXA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The <b>submarine</b> {{was laid}} down on 15 March 1937 at the DeSchiMAG AG Weser yard in Bremen, {{launched}} on 14 May 1938, and commissioned on 4 August 1938 {{under the command}} of Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Schuch as part of the 6th U-boat Flotilla.|$|E
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's <b>Submarine</b> Committee for a large <b>submarine</b> capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian <b>submarine</b> developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{means by}} which the <b>submarine's</b> {{priority}} attack worked differently in each game: in the Nova Games release, <b>submarines</b> attacked and defended during combat movement, where defending <b>submarines</b> could fire at any passing ships, similar to antiaircraft fire. This is the only version in which defenders make the first attack, and the defender may also choose not to exercise the attack, as it would allow ships to return fire. In Classic, the priority attack was only given to attacking <b>submarines,</b> and ships hit by <b>submarines</b> could not return fire. Later games allowed defending <b>submarines</b> to return fire if they were hit by the priority attack. In all cases, <b>submarines</b> were only able to hit other naval units. Since Europe, air units in turn could not target <b>submarines</b> in the absence of destroyers, except in Revised.|$|R
50|$|Attack <b>submarines</b> (SSKs and SSNs) were {{developed}} to include faster, longer range and more discriminating torpedoes. This, coupled with improvements to sonar systems, made ballistic missile <b>submarines</b> more vulnerable to attack <b>submarines</b> and also increased the anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities of attack subs. SSBNs themselves as well as cruise-missile <b>submarines</b> (SSGNs) were fitted with increasingly more accurate and longer range missiles and received the greatest noise reduction technology. To counter this increasing threat torpedoes were honed to target <b>submarines</b> more effectively and new anti-submarine missiles and rockets {{were developed}} to give ships a longer-range anti-submarine capability. Ships, <b>submarines</b> and maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) also received increasingly effective technology for locating <b>submarines,</b> e.g. magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) and improved sonar.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{assignments}} {{for female}} submariners {{were on the}} blue and gold crews of selected guided-missile <b>submarines</b> (SSGNs) and ballistic-missile <b>submarines</b> (SSBNs). Two <b>submarines</b> of each type served as the inaugural vessels.|$|R
