40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} need of {{powdering}} <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> and to produce a powdering machine. Material and Method: The need of powdering <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> was done by questionnaires to directors or chiefs of purchase departments in 29 hospitals across the country. The practice in powdering <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> was given by chiefs of the central sterile supply department (CSSD). A powdering machine was produced by the researchers in consultation with CSSD personnel in a hospital. The quality of powdering <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> was evaluated by infection control nurses in the hospital. Cost comparison was done by a health economist. Results: The study in 2002 revealed {{that all of the}} 29 hospitals used recycled <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves.</b> Powdering of <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> was done by hand in 27. 6 % and by powdering machine in 62. 10 %. Corn powder was used in 55. 2 % and talc in 41. 4 %. Defects in powdering ranged from 1. 1 % to 51. 7 %. No defects was found in <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> powdered by the machine produced by the researchers. The costs for powdering and one pair of reused <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> were 0. 10 and 5. 59 baht respectively. Conclusion: <b>Surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> were reused in all hospitals in Thailand. The powdering machine was effective and was not difficult to make...|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, {{examination}} gloves are sized in XS, S, M and L. Some brands {{may offer}} size XL. <b>Surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> are usually sized more precisely {{since they are}} worn for a much {{longer period of time}} and require exceptional dexterity. The sizing of <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> are based on the measured length across the palm in inches, at a level slight above the thumb's sewn. Typical sizing ranges from 5.5 to 9.0 at an increment of 0.5. Some brands may also offer size 5.0 which is particularly relevant to women practitioners. First-time users of <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> may take some time to find the right size and brand that suit their hand geometry the most.

50|$|Halsted was {{credited}} with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were {{ready for the next}} level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including Harvey Williams Cushing and Walter Dandy, founders of the surgical subspecialty of neurosurgery; and Hugh H. Young, a founder of the specialty of urology.He is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements. As one of the first proponents of hemostasis and investigators of wound healing, Halsted pioneered Halsted's principles, modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, exact approximation of tissue in wound closures without excessive tightness, and gentle handling of tissues.

40|$|Background: A <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> {{will protect}} {{surgeons}} and patients {{only if the}} glove’s integrity remains intact. However, several {{studies have demonstrated that}} undetected micro-perforations of surgical gloves are common. Because of the possibility of <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> puncture, an antimicrobial <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> was developed. The aim of this laboratory based experimental study was to assess the antibacterial efficacy of the interior chlorhexidine-gluconate (CHG) -coat of an antimicrobial synthetic polyisoprene <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> by using a standardized microbiological challenge. Methods: Sixteen healthy adult participants donned one antimicrobial <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> and one non-antimicrobial <b>surgical</b> <b>glove</b> randomly allocated to their dominant and non-dominant hand following a crossover design. During a 2 -h wear time, participants performed standardized finger and hand movements. Thereafter, the interior surface of excised fingers of the removed gloves was challenged with 8. 00 log 10 cfu/mL[*]S. aureus (ATCC 6538) or K. pneumoniae (ATCC 4352), respectively. The main outcome measure was the viable mean log 10 cfu counts of the two glove groups after 5  min contact with the interior glove’s surface. Results: When comparing an antimicrobial glove against an untreated reference glove after 2 -h simulated use wear-time, a mean reduction factor of 6. 24 log 10 (S. aureus) and 6. 22 log 10 (K. pneumoniae) was achieved after 5  min contact. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that wearing antibacterial gloves on hands does not negatively impact their antibacterial activity after 2 -h of wear. This may have a potential benefit for patient safety in case of glove puncture during surgical procedures...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Intact <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> are {{a barrier}} to {{microorganisms}} migration between surgical team members and the patient. The <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> are changed at various junctures but the effects of changing <b>gloves</b> during <b>surgical</b> procedures on various surgical parameters or clinical outcomes are not established. Aim: To determine rationale of glove change during orthopaedic procedures, differences amongst surgical parameters with and without changing the <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> and whether frequent <b>glove</b> change affected <b>surgical</b> parameters or clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: A prospective multicenter study conducted at three centers from January 2014 to January 2016. A 250 patients were divided into 2 groups (n= 125 each) in Group 1, surgical team operated with regular changing of gloves. In Group 2, only 1 set of double gloves were worn throughout the procedure. Surgical parameters or clinical outcomes were assessed for both the groups. Statistical analyses included the median, mode, range, Interquartile Range (IQR) and sample standard deviation (s) and independent-samples t-test. Bacterial counts were expressed as median with (IQR). Results: Surgical Timing Difference was 10 (S.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> {{are used}} to prevent {{contamination}} of {{the patient and the}} hospital staff with pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the actual effectiveness of gloves by examining the damage (perforations, tears) to latex gloves during surgery in the case of primary hip and knee prosthesis implantation. Materials and methods: Latex <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves</b> used by surgeons for primary hip and knee replacement surgeries were collected directly after the surgery and tested using the watertightness test according to ISO EN 455 - 1 : 2000. Results: 540 gloves were collected from 104 surgeries. In 32. 7 % of surgeries at least one glove was damaged. Of all the gloves collected, 10. 9 % were damaged, mainly on the index finger. The size of the perforations ranged from ≤ 1 mm to over 5 mm. The surgeon’s glove size was the only factor that significantly influenced the occurrence of glove damage. Surgeon training level, procedure duration, and the use of bone cement had no significant influence. Conclusions: Our results highlight the high failure rate of <b>surgical</b> <b>gloves.</b> This has acute implications for <b>glove</b> production, <b>surgical</b> practice, and hygiene guidelines.
