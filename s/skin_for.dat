5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} {{which can be}} absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, and stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals. It can stain the <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact.|$|E
5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium level {{is known to be}} higher than 3.3mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under the <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> mild or moderate cases.|$|E

5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown <b>skin.</b> <b>For</b> this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E

5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per <b>skin)</b> <b>for</b> wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E

She is the younger sister of Eddy Raja.|$|E
5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E

5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their <b>skin</b> <b>for</b> respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The main mode {{of play in}} the Guitar Hero {{games is}} Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across {{the rest of the}} game.
