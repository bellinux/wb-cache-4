25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or <b>strain-hardening.</b> Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

50|$|Brittle {{materials}} such as concrete or carbon fiber {{do not have a}} yield point, and do not <b>strain-harden.</b> Therefore, the ultimate strength and breaking strength are the same. A typical stress-strain curve is shown in Fig.3. Typical brittle materials like glass do not show any plastic deformation but fail while the deformation is elastic. One of the characteristics of a brittle failure is that the two broken parts can be reassembled to produce the same shape as the original component as {{there will not be a}} neck formation like in the case of ductile materials. A typical stress-strain curve for a brittle material will be linear. For some materials, such as concrete, tensile strength is negligible compared to the compressive strength and it is assumed zero for many engineering applications. Glass fibers have a tensile strength stronger than steel, but bulk glass usually does not. This is because of the stress intensity factor associated with defects in the material. As the size of the sample gets larger, the size of defects also grows. In general, the tensile strength of a rope is always less than the sum of the tensile strengths of its individual fibers.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} smarter and adaptive, energy {{absorption}} materials especially for human protection applications has fueled {{the interest in}} new and alternative energy absorbing composites. In this thesis a 'novel' energy absorbing fluid-composite that utilized a shear thickening fluid is developed. Shear-thickening fluids are a class of field responsive fluids that {{have the ability to}} transition from low viscosity to high viscosity under an imposed deformation field. Two different types of silica particles are used to create shear thickening fluids. The first are polydisperse and non spherical, with a median diameter of 1. 7 ± 1. 4 micrometer, while the second are monodisperse spherical particles of 0. 3 ± 0. 03 micrometer diameter. The particles are dispersed in ethylene glycol at volume fractions of up to [phi]= 47 % for the polydisperse sample and up to [phi]= 60 % for the monodisperse spheres. The behavior of the silica suspensions is studied under steady shear, small and large amplitude oscillatory shear flow and also in transient extensional flow. The viscosity of the polydisperse suspension is found to be much greater than the monodisperse one due to the difference in particles shape. Oscillatory experiments indicate that both the onset and magnitude of the shear thickening depends on the frequency and strain applied and show that rapid time-varying deformations result in maximum energy dissipation. (cont.) Two different regimes are found through extensional flow measurement: at low extension rates the suspensions respond as a viscous rate-thinning fluid, whereas beyond a critical extension rate, the suspension <b>strain-hardens</b> and ultimately fractures in a solid-like fashion. Polyurethane open cell or 'reticulated' foam with relative density of 0. 03 and average cell size of 360 micrometer is chosen to envelop the concentrated silica suspensions. The behavior of this nonlinear fluid-solid composite is studied over a range of filling fractions under quasi-static deformation rates (strain rates between 10 ⁻² - s⁻¹), under dynamic impact loading (with energy densities of e = 10 ⁵ - 10 ⁶ J/m³) and under high strain-rate deformations (strain rates up to 800 s⁻¹). Results show that, if the foam is filled with a shear thickening suspension, the composite stiffens even at strain rates of 10 ⁻² s⁻¹ as the impregnated fluid shear-thickens due to the high local strain rates that develop on cellular length scales. High impact load experiments show two different mechanisms for energy absorption: at lower impact energies viscous dissipation is dominant; whereas, after a critical impact energy is reached, the fluid undergoes a transition from liquid-like to solid-like. High-speed digital video-imaging shows that cracks form and propagate through the sample and the impact energy is absorbed by viscoplastic deformation. (cont.)

40|$|PM {{stainless}} steels are increasing in use {{and are expected}} {{to do so in the}} future. A lot of work has been carried out concerning production and sintering of stainless steel powders and on the resulting corrosion behaviour. The deformation behaviour of these materials is less studied. The search for new applications raises a need for an increased knowledge of the deformation behaviour of these materials. This thesis treats the monotonic and cyclic deformation behaviour of porous and dense austenitic {{stainless steels}}, where emphasis is placed on the porous materials. By including dense steels, the understanding of the deformation behaviour of porous structures is facilitated. All materials in the study resemble the commercial grade 316 L. The monotonic yield stress of the fully dense materials studied follows the classic Hall-Petch relation. Nitrogen amplifies the effect of a fine grain size by promoting planar slip. The cyclic yield stress, determined from the cyclic stress-strain curves, does also follow a Hall-Petch type of relation, the alloying with nitrogen here having less importance. The latter finding is explained by the breakdown of the planar slip mode during cyclic straining. Small surface cracks initiate early during cyclic straining but the nucleation ceases after approximately half of the life time. The mean crack length increases continuously until final failure. The initiation is related to the formation of slip bands on the surface. Thus, high nitrogen content promotes initiation at slip bands and the following crack growth is very much related to these bands. This may cause an increased roughness induced crack closure and a more simultaneous growth of the whole crack population, which indicates a higher consumption of strain energy. Opening of slip bands may also cause a crack growth retarding effect that can be compared to crack branching. A coarser grain size causes flocculation of cracks and a transition to intergranular crack initiation. However, cracks grow exclusively in a transgranular manner independent of grain size. A finer grain size may hinder small cracks in early growth, which seems to be promoted by a low nitrogen content. The deformation behaviour of PM austenitic stainless steels is heavily influenced by the presence of pores, where the interconnected ones have the strongest influence. During monotonic deformation, the pores cause microplasticity, which is more pronounced in thin sections. Oxides in the ppb's (previous particle boundaries) may have a stiffening effect, resulting in a more truly elastic behaviour and a more marked yield point during initial deformation. The following strain hardening is less affected by the pore morphology and ppb structure. The materials <b>strain-harden</b> continuously preceding fracture and hardly any necking is detectable. Hereby the uniform elongation and the tensile strength become uniquely related. During cyclic straining, pores enforce a strain gradient in the material, which causes a pronounced cyclic hardening. The distribution of strains is more inhomogeneous in materials in which interconnected pores dominate. Fatigue cracks initiate at pores and grow along ppb's, as was the case in the studied materials with > 0. 2 % oxygen. Fatigue cracks appear more frequently at the surface of materials cyclically strained at high strain amplitudes (> 0. 003), and internal cracking dominates at lower strain amplitudes. The fatigue strength is believed to be less affected by weak interparticle bonding than the ductility...|$|R
50|$|Dislocation glide is {{the main}} process but cannot act on its own to produce large strains due {{to the effects of}} <b>strain-hardening,</b> where a {{dislocation}} ‘tangle’ can inhibit the movement of other dislocations, which then pile up behind the blocked ones causing the crystal to become difficult to deform. Dislocations can move through a crystal due to the energy introduced to the system by deformation and temperature. However, the dislocations cannot move in any direction through the crystal. In dislocation glide and at low temperatures, the dislocations are restricted to glide planes, or crystallographic planes across which the bonds are relatively weak.

(cont.) Results show that, if the foam is filled with a shear thickening suspension, the composite stiffens even at strain rates of 10 - 2 s- 1 as the impregnated fluid shear-thickens due to the high local strain rates that develop on cellular length scales.

High-speed digital video-imaging shows that cracks form and propagate through the sample and the impact energy is absorbed by viscoplastic deformation. Potential applications for this fluid-solid composite include Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) protection and Primary Blast Injuries (PBI) mitigation. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a serious and potentially fatal injury that results from rapid accelerations of the head, and subjects the brain to high intracranial pressure and shear stresses. To reduce TBI damage, one needs to reduce the magnitude and rate of increase of the intracranial overpressure created by blasts or impacts and subsequent accelerations of the head. We investigated the use of the shear-thickening fluid-based composite to mitigate TBI and we found that through the mechanism of viscoplastic deformation, with solidification and shear banding, the composite was able to absorb large amount of energies (106 J/m 3) and still maintain stresses below critical levels. Additionally, the energy absorbing properties of the composite were found to be independent of the magnitude of the incoming energy. Blast injuries are caused by high rate loading of the chest cavity after impact from a blast wave. (cont.) The resultant pressure wave is transmitted and reflected inside the chest cavity where, at certain points, the pressure gradient became too big for the alveoli to sustain resulting in bursting and bleeding. A shock tube apparatus has been used to test the material response of the STF based composite. Single layer geometries have shown to provide some protection but they also always induced a magnification of the peak pressure which is related to the weight of the samples. A sandwich geometry formed by layering fluid-filled foam facing the incoming wave backed by unfilled foam is found to reduce the rate of pressure rise by 3 orders of magnitude. This behavior can be well described by a double spring-mass-damper system. The layered composite is found to respond linearly with increases in incoming pressure, as the rate of pressure rise has a linear relationship with the magnitude of the incoming pressure. The results found in this study suggest that the STF based composite is an excellent candidate for use in applications of both TBI protection and PBI mitigation. by Giorgia Bettin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Deformation and {{metamorphism}} {{of rocks}} are fundamentally interrelated but {{the ways in}} which processes of reaction and deformation mutually inﬂuence each other are still poorly understood in natural rocks. The aim of this thesis is to investigate relationships between plastic deformation and mineral reactions, by means of rock deformation experiments. Within this broad aim, the thesis focuses on (1) the spatial distribution of deformation and reaction during ductile shear, (2) the eﬀect of mineral reactions on the strength, deformation mechanisms and microstructures of dry rocks and (3) the eﬀect of ductile shear deformation on kinetics and mechanisms of a dry net-transfer reaction. To these ends, water-deﬁcient plagioclase-olivine composites were studied after shear deformation and hydrostatic experiments inside and outside their chemical stability ﬁelds, using a Griggs apparatus. Experiments were performed on anorthite-forsterite (An 92 -Fo 93) and labradorite-forsterite (An 60 -Fo 93) composites at 900 ◦ C, conﬁning pressures between 1000 - 1600 MPa and with constant shear strain rates of γ ∼ 5 x 10 − 5 s− 1. ˙ The hydrostatic and deformed samples were examined by backscattered scanning electron microscopy (BSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At all chosen conﬁning pressures, stable labradorite-olivine composites are found to <b>strain-harden</b> during shear deformation, up to stresses close to the brittle-plastic transition (τ ∼ 500 - 780 MPa). Pure olivine and labradorite samples are less strong (τ ∼ 350 and 100 MPa, respectively) than the labradorite-olivine composites. The pure olivine sample displayed low temperature plasticity, accompanied by some dynamic recrystallisation. The hardening of the labradorite-olivine composites is probably due to the inhibition of grain boundary migration by inter-phase boundaries, which prevent recovery. The prevention of recovery results in labradorite and olivine grains with local high dislocation densities. At all chosen conﬁning pressures, concurrent plastic deformation and reaction of metastable anorthite-olivine composites results in a pronounced decrease in shear stress (τ ∼ 150 MPa). The onset of weakening coincides with the formation of ﬁne-grained polyphase reaction products (size ∼ 0. 25 - 1. 0 µm). The onset of steady-state ﬂow (γ > 5, τ ∼ 200 MPa) is characterised by the coalescence of these products into interconnecting layers. The ﬁne-grained reaction products deform by grain size sensitive creep. Fabric analysis using the autocorrelation function shows a strong correlation on a sample scale between reaction progress and strain; large shear strain is locally associated with high reaction progress. On a grain scale the applied strain is localised and accommodated in the interconnecting layers of reaction products. Strain accommodation in reaction product layers reduces the strain rate in the reacting anorthite and olivine grains, which, as a result, are able to undergo recovery by dislocation climb. The reaction weakening mechanism in anorthite-olivine composites is grain size reduction by crystallisation of fine-grained polyphase reaction products, which deform by diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding. The reaction causes a change in deformation mechanism from grain size insensitive creep of the anorthite-olivine composite to grain size sensitive creep of reaction products. The measured reduction of shear stress at a constant strain rate confirms this change in the dominant deformation mechanism of the samples. The growth rates of enstatite and pyroxene-spinel-garnet reaction rims observed around olivine and plagioclase indicate that reaction at hydrostatic and water-deficient conditions is controlled by the limited transport of chemical components. The amount of pressure overstepping in the experiments affects the reaction progress because the rate of nucleation increases exponentially with the Gibbs free energy of reaction (the amount of pressure overstepping for pressure-sensitive reactions). Nevertheless, the studied reactions display a delayed onset of nucleation of new phases (30 to � 80 hrs), even at pressure overstepping of 700 to 900 MPa. The plastic deformation of anorthite-olivine composites was found to enhance the studied mineral reactions at water-deficient conditions. This enhancement is shown by the increase of reaction progress as well as the increase of the nucleation and growth rates of reaction rims during deformation. The reaction between anorthite and olivine is enhanced by an increase in the nucleation rate of new phases. The increased nucleation rate may be due to high dislocation densities in the reactant grains that deform by low-temperature plasticity. The mechanical transport of reaction products by grain boundary sliding may change the local equilibrium conditions, which, in combination with slow diffusion and fast nucleation, results in the formation of metastable kyanite. In summary, this experimental study shows that concurrent plastic deformation and reaction processes in plagioclase-olivine composites positively influence each other: rheological weakening may result from mineral reactions, and the localisation of reaction progress in shear zones can be enhanced by plastic deformation. The results of this thesis imply that concurrent deformation and reaction at water-deficient conditions are of major importance in explaining how and why strain localisation occurs in polyphase rocks under a large range of geological conditions...|$|R
50|$|Cold forming has {{the effect}} of {{increasing}} the yield strength of steel, the increase being the consequence of cold working well into the <b>strain-hardening</b> range. This increase is in the zones where the material is deformed by bending or working. The yield stress can be assumed to have been increased by 15% or more for design purposes. The yield stress value of cold-formed steel is usually between 33ksi and 80ksi. The measured values of Modulus of Elasticity based on the standard methods usually range from 29,000 to 30,000 ksi (200 to 207 GPa). A value of 29,500 ksi (203 GPa) is recommended by AISI in its specification for design purposes. The ultimate tensile strength of steel sheets in the sections has little direct relationship to the design of those members. The load-carrying capacities of cold-formed steel flexural and compression members are usually limited by yield point or buckling stresses that are less than the yield point of steel, particularly for those compression elements having relatively large flat-width ratios and for compression members having relatively large slenderness ratios. The exceptions are bolted and welded connections, the strength of which depends not only on the yield point but also on the ultimate tensile strength of the material. Studies indicate that the effects of cold work on formed steel members depend largely upon the spread between the tensile and the yield strength of the virgin material.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{repeated}} stress relaxations {{is used to}} determine the <b>strain-hardening</b> that takes place during stress relaxation tests performed at different temperatures and for various crystallographic deformation axises. It is shown that strain hardening for stress relaxation conditions is substantially higher than for constant strain-rate deformation conditions. This behaviour is found to be more and more pronounced with increasing temperatures. It is suggested that <b>strain-hardening</b> is not dislocation substructure dependent but is inherent to dislocation motion...|$|E
40|$|One {{simple way}} to {{approximately}} describe the decay of creep rate at con-stant uniaxial stress o is {{to assume that the}} creep rate ¢C is a function of load duration T, or the current creep strain ¢ C or the current age t; thus, in general, ~C = F(°,¢C,T,t) " The decay of the creep rate as a function of load duration is called time-hardening, the decay of the creep rate as a function of ¢ C is called <b>strain-hardening,</b> and the decay as a function of age is called aging (1, 2). Aging is in some way reflected in all existing concrete creep laws, but not <b>strain-hardening</b> or time-hardening. Time-hard-ening has the advantage that it does not destroy linearity of the stress-strain relation, while <b>strain-hardening</b> does (if the stress is variable and unknown). A form of time-hardening corresponding to an aging Maxwell model was introduced in the 1930 's by Glanville and Dischinger and is called the rate-of-creep (or Dischinger) method (3). L'Hermite (4, 5) was apparently the first to introduce <b>strain-hardening</b> for concrete. He proposed a special form of function F such that...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{characterization of}} the microstructure evolution in high-Mn steel during deformation is of great importance to understanding its <b>strain-hardening</b> behavior. In the current study, in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction was employed to characterize the microstructure evolution in a Fe- 17 Mn- 1. 5 Al- 0. 3 C steel during a tensile test. The microstructure at different engineering strain levels—in terms of ε-martensite and α’-martensite volume fractions, the stacking fault probability, and the twin fault probability—was analyzed by the Rietveld refinement method. The Fe- 17 Mn- 1. 5 Al- 0. 3 C steel exhibits a high ultimate tensile strength with a superior uniform elongation and a high <b>strain-hardening</b> rate. The remaining high <b>strain-hardening</b> rate at the strain level about 0. 025 to 0. 35 results from ε-martensite dominant transformation-induced-plasticity (TRIP) effect. The increase in the <b>strain-hardening</b> rate at the strain level around 0. 35 to 0. 43 is attributed to the synergetic α’-martensite dominant TRIP and twinning-induced-plasticity (TWIP) effects. An evaluation of the stacking fault energy (SFE) of the Fe- 17 Mn- 1. 5 Al- 0. 3 C steel by the synchrotron measurements shows good agreement with the thermodynamic calculation of the SFE...|$|E

Two {{essential}} elements of formability analysis are accurate <b>strain-hardening</b> laws and knowledge of material anisotropy, captured by the R-value parameter.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the temperature and molecular weight dependenceof the <b>strain-hardening</b> behavior of polycarbonate. It is shown that the <b>strain-hardening</b> modulus reduces with increasing temperature and decreasing molecularweight. This result is interpreted in terms of temperature accelerated relaxationof the entanglement network. Moreover, it is shown that frozen-in orientations, in-duced by homogeneous deformations above the glass transition temperature, leadto anisotropic yield behavior that can be fully rationalized (and modelled) in termsof a superimposed stress contribution of the pre-strained network...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{expanding}} cavity model (ECM) {{for determining}} indentation hardness of elastic <b>strain-hardening</b> plastic materials is developed. The derivation {{is based on}} a strain gradient plasticity solution for an internally pressurized thick-walled spherical shell of an elastic power-law hardening material. Closed-form formulas are provided for both conical and spherical indentations. The indentation radius enters these formulas with its own dimensional identity, unlike that in classical plasticity based ECMs where indentation geometrical parameters appear only in non-dimensional forms. As a result, the newly developed ECM can capture the indentation size effect. The formulas explicitly show that indentation hardness depends on Young’s modulus, yield stress, <b>strain-hardening</b> exponent and strain gradient coefficient of the indented material {{as well as on the}} geometry of the indenter. The new model reduces to existing classical plasticity based ECMs (including Johnson’s ECM for elastic–perfectly plastic materials) when the strain gradient effect is not considered. The numerical results obtained using the newly developed model reveal that the hardness is indeed indentation size dependent when the indentation radius is very small: the smaller the indentation, the larger the hardness. Also, the indentation hardness is seen to increase with the Young’s modulus and <b>strain-hardening</b> level of the indented material for both conical and spherical indentations. The <b>strain-hardening</b> effect on the hardness is observed to be significant for materials having strong <b>strain-hardening</b> characteristics. In addition, it is found that the indentation hardness increases with decreasing cone angle of the conical indenter or decreasing radius of the spherical indenter. These trends agree with existing experimental observations and model predictions...|$|E
