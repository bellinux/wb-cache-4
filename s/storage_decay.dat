40|$|Conductivity of {{insulating}} materials {{is a key}} parameter to determine how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. Classical ASTM and IEC methods to measure thin film insulator conductivity apply a constant voltage to two electrodes around the sample and measure the resulting current for tens of minutes. However, conductivity is more appropriately measured for spacecraft charging applications as the "decay" of charge deposited {{on the surface of}} an insulator. Charge decay methods expose one side of the insulator in vacuum to sequences of charged particles, light, and plasma, with a metal electrode attached {{to the other side of}} the insulator. Data are obtained by capacitive coupling to measure both the resulting voltage on the open surface and emission of electrons from the exposed surface, as well monitoring currents to the electrode. Instrumentation for both classical and charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> methods has been developed and tested at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and at Utah State University (USU). Details of the apparatus, test methods and data analysis are given here. The JPL charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> chamber is a first-generation instrument, designed to make detailed measurements on only three to five samples at a time. Because samples must typically be tested for over a month, a second-generation high sample throughput charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> chamber was developed at USU with the capability of testing up to 32 samples simultaneously. Details are provided about the instrumentation to measure surface charge and current; for charge deposition apparatus and control; the sample holders to properly isolate the mounted samples; the sample carousel to rotate samples into place; the control of the sample environment including sample vacuum, ambient gas, and sample temperature; and the computer control and data acquisition systems. Measurements are compared here for a number of thin film insulators using both methods at both facilities. We have found that conductivity determined from charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> methods is 102 to 104 larger than values obtained from classical methods.

The EDB treatment, so far as is known, has had no adverse effect on fruit quality, while the vapor-heat treatment has at times been known to considerably reduce fruit quality. Shippers using the EDB method have found, however, that considerable percentages of EDB-treated papayas shipped from Hawaii to the West Coast decayed either during the transit period or soon after arrival on the market. Papayas shipped by the vapor-heat treatment were comparatively free from <b>storage</b> <b>decay,</b> {{and as a result}} they found wider market acceptance than the EDB-treated fruits.

40|$|Spacecraft surface {{charging}} {{can lead}} to arcing {{and a loss of}} electricity generation capability in solar panels or even loss of a satellite. The charging problem may be further aggravated by atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth orbits, which modifies the surface of materials like polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coatings, cover glass etc, used on satellite surfaces, affecting materials properties, such as resistivity, secondary electron emissivity and photo emission, which govern the charging behavior. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. To study the AO exposure effect on charging governing properties, an atomic oxygen exposure facility based on laser detonation of oxygen was built. The facility produces AO with a peak velocity value around 10 - 12 km/s and a higher flux than that existing in orbit. After exposing the polyimide test material to the equivalent of 10 years of AO fluence at an altitude of 700 - 800 km, surface charging properties like surface resistivity and volume resistivity were measured. The measurement was performed in a vacuum using the charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> method at room temperature, which is considered the most appropriate for measuring resistivity for space applications.

Performing analysis on fresh whole blood samples is often not feasible in remote and resource-poor areas. Convenient methods for sample storage and transport are urgently needed. Methods Real-time QT-NASBA was performed on whole blood spiked with a dilution series of purified in-vitro cultivated gametocytes. The blood was either freshly processed or spotted on filter papers. Gametocyte detection sensitivity for QT-NASBA was determined and controlled by microscopy. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were subjected to five different storage conditions {{and the loss of}} sensitivity over time was investigated. A formula to approximate the loss of Pfs 25 -mRNA due to different storage conditions and time was developed. Results Pfs 25 -mRNA was measured in time to positivity (TTP) and correlated well with the microscopic counts and the theoretical concentrations of the dilution series. TTP results constantly indicated higher amounts of RNA in filter paper samples extracted after 24 hours than in immediately extracted fresh blood. Among investigated storage conditions freezing at − 20 °C performed best with 98. 7 % of the Pfs 25 -mRNA still detectable at day 28 compared to fresh blood samples. After 92 days, the RNA detection rate was only slightly decreased to 92. 9 %. Samples stored at 37 °C showed most decay with only 64. 5 % of Pfs 25 -mRNA detectable after one month. The calculated theoretical detection limit for 24 h-old DBS filter paper samples was 0. 0095 (95 % CI: 0. 0025 to 0. 0380) per μl.

In 2011, 55, 000 metric tons of methane emissions were reduced and 301 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions were avoided through the use of biogas alone. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion through the fermentation of organic material. It is mainly composed of methane with a rage of 50 to 80 % in its concentration. Carbon dioxide covers 20 to 50 % and small amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. ^ The biogas production systems are anaerobic digestion facilities and the optimal operation of an anaerobic digester requires the scheduling of all batches from multiple feedstocks during a specific time horizon. The availability times, biomass quantities, biogas production rates and <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> rates must all be taken into account for maximal biogas production to be achieved during the planning horizon.

Moreover, all batches need to be processed in the digester in a specified time with the restriction that only one batch can be processed at a time. The developed algorithm is applied to 3 different examples and a comparison with results obtained in previous studies is presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Dissipation {{of charges}} built {{up near the}} surface of {{insulators}} due to space environment interaction is central to understanding spacecraft charging. Conductivity of insulating materials is key to determine how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. To understand these processes requires knowledge of how charge is deposited within the insulator, the mechanisms for charge trapping and charge transport within the insulator, and how the profile of trapped charge affects the transport and emission of charges from insulators. One must consider generation of mobile electrons and holes, their trapping, thermal de-trapping, mobility and recombination. Conductivity is more appropriately measured for spacecraft charging applications as the "decay" of charge deposited {{on the surface of}} an insulator, rather than by flow of current across two electrodes around the sample. We have found that conductivity determined from charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> methods is 102 to 104 smaller than values obtained from classical ASTM and IEC methods for a variety of thin film insulating samples. For typical spacecraft charging conditions, classical conductivity predicts decay times on the order of minutes to hours (less than typical orbit periods); however, the higher charge storage conductivities predict decay times on the order of weeks to months leading to accumulation of charge with subsequent orbits. We found experimental evidence that penetration profiles of radiation and light are exceedingly important, and that internal electric fields due to charge profiles and high-field conduction by trapped electrons must be considered for space applications. We have also studied whether the decay constants depend on incident voltage and flux or on internal charge distributions and electric fields; light-activated discharge of surface charge to distinguish among differing charge trapping centers; and radiation-induced conductivity. Our experiments also show that "Malter" electron emission occurs for hours after turning off the electron beam. This Malter emission similar to emission due to negative electron affinity in semiconductors {{is a result of the}} prior radiation or optical excitations of valence electrons and their slow drift among traps towards the surface where they are subsequently emitted.

EJ of ripened fruit declined substantially, but gradually increased after late sampling period. Soluble solids (SS) varied among different harvest groups and during the storage period. Fruits increased SS upon ripening. Immature fruits had higher titrable acids (TA) than optimum and late mature fruit. TA decreased during the storage period and also upon fruit ripening. Superficial scald developed on the ripened fruit in December, 1982 and increased thereafter. Immature fruits showed higher incidence of scald development than the optimum and late mature fruit in December, but all fruits developed scald symptoms after February, 1983. Optimum mature and late mature fruit developed acceptable flesh texture, juiciness, and flavor upon ripening until February, 1983. Immature fruit was incapable of developing an acceptable flavor upon ripening throughout the sampling period...|$|E
40|$|Insulators {{used in the}} {{construction}} of spacecraft are irradiated with high-energy electrons in the space environment and this sometimes causes the insulators to charge to very high voltages. Such charged insulators can generate spontaneous electric partial-discharge pulses of the order of mA to tens of A. These pulses sometimes last enough time to destroy the expensive micro-circuitry present in the spacecraft. In evaluating the threat to the spacecraft due to these discharges, calculation of the resistivity becomes a critical parameter since it determines how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. So far, resistivity values for the insulators for spacecraft applications have been simply imported from tabulated results measured using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) methods. This thesis work provides the details of the charge storage method which {{has been found to be}} more appropriate in calculating the resistivity of spacecraft insulators by emulating the space environment better. This method is based on the concept that the resistivity is better measured as the decay of the charge deposited on the surface of an insulator, rather than by the flow of current across two electrodes around the sample which is the case with the classical method of measurements. From the results obtained from the charge storage method, it has been found that the ASTM resistivity values for thin film insulating spacecraft materials have been found to under-predict charge transport values applicable to many spacecraft charging problems, by 10 to 104 times. The charge storage method has only one side of the insulator in vacuum exposed to charged particles, light and plasma, with a metal electrode attached to the other side of the insulator. The chamber for measuring the charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> has been designed with the capability to measure 32 samples simultaneously. The details of the apparatus, instrumentation, test methods, data acquisition methods, and data analysis for measuring resistivity of the spacecraft insulators are given here. Details about the vacuum environment, sample mounting, isolation of the samples, charging of the samples, measurement of the surface charge, rotary motion of the sample carousel, etc., are also given. The report also includes differences between the classical methods and the charge storage method both in terms instrumentation and methodology. The results obtained from both methods are tabulated showing the superiority of the charge storage method. Recommendations for future work are also included...|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft surface {{charging}} {{can lead}} to arcing {{and a loss of}} electrical power generation capability of solar panel, or even loss of a satellite. The charging problem may be further aggravated by the atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which modifies the surface of materials like, Polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coating, cover glass, etc., used on satellite surface. These affect material properties, such as resistivity, secondary electron emissivity, photo emission, which govern the charging behaviour. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. This research develops a new facility at KIT, based on a novel technique for generating atomic oxygen flux involving laser induced breakdown of molecular oxygen. High velocity AO in an evacuated nozzle is formed, where laser beam breakdowns molecular oxygen into AO injected through a pressurized pulse valve into the nozzle. The energy of AO is measured using Time of flight (TOF) technique. The generated AO flux is measured using Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). The Mass Flow Controller (MFC) inserted in oxygen gas supply line measures the net amount of gas being injected through pulse valve. The spectral analysis of AO production wavelength (777. 6 nm) is detected using a spectrometer. The relative abundance of generated species is observed using a Quadrupole Mass Analyzer System (QMAS). The developed facility produces AO of velocity 8 ～ 14 kms- 1 having the flux in the order of 1018 atoms/m 2 /shot. This flux is used to expose spacecraft surface materials for extended period of 10 years at 800 km, equivalent to exposure of satellite surface materials to atomic oxygen fluence for the normal lifetime of the satellite in orbit. This thesis develops a new method and facility for the measurement of resistivity of atomic oxygen exposed polyimide by using surface charge decay method. The resistivity measurement is performed in vacuum using the charge <b>storage</b> <b>decay</b> method at room temperature, which is considered most appropriate for measuring the resistivity for space application. The mathematical formulation and experimental facility are indigenously developed to measure resistivity as per space requirement. We introduce a new method to measure surface and volume resistivity together, which can be further improved to measure the secondary electron characteristics. The results show that the surface resistivity increases and the volume resistivity remains almost the same for the AO exposure fluence of 5. 4 x 1018 atoms cm- 2 on polyimide film. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 311 号 学位授与年月日:平成 23 年 3 月 25 日 1.

40|$|Biomass {{conversion}} processes {{have the}} potential for satisfying approximately 25 % of the national demand for methane gas. At the present time, very little analytical work has been done to optimally design and operate the production facilities associated with these processes. This study was motivated by the high cost of these systems and the attendant need for efficient operation. While in <b>storage,</b> biomass <b>decays</b> (exponentially) over time, and gas production declines (exponentially) with time. The basic operational problem is to determine the optimal residence times for batches in the anaerobic digester to maximize total production over a fixed planning horizon. This paper provides analysis to characterize the form of the optimal policy and presents an efficient algorithm for obtaining the solution. An example problem, based upon realistic biomass and digester data, is used to illustrate the algorithm as well as the behavior of the optimal solution. inventory/production, applications, perishable/decaying items...|$|R
