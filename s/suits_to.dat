5|$|Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an {{unveiling}} {{ceremony at}} Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, {{along with his}} crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> Hydra. Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E
5|$|The Thule Society, led by Karl Haushofer and Dietlinde Eckhart, use Envy and Edward's kidnapped father Hohenheim as {{catalysts}} to open {{a portal}} to Edward's world, believing {{it to be the}} utopia Shamballa after learning about it from Hohenheim. A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to free an ace of each <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> make four foundations, then to build them up by <b>suit</b> up <b>to</b> Kings, placing the second King of each <b>suit</b> and finally <b>to</b> build them down, again by <b>suit,</b> <b>to</b> Aces.|$|R

5|$|The {{palladium}} core in the arc reactor {{that keeps}} Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and {{choosing not to}} tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E

25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of water}} is {{higher than that of}} air. As water conducts heat 20 times more than air, divers in cold water must insulate their bodies with diving <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> avoid hypothermia. Gases used in diving have very different thermal conductivity; trimix conducts heat more than air and argon conducts less heat than air hence the reason many trimix divers inflate their drysuits with argon.|$|E

25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were muffled by the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight <b>suits)</b> <b>to</b> solve these problems.|$|E
50|$|Typically H.263 {{optimized}} is now recommended as {{the default}} quantization matrix with DivX encoding.

25|$|Pressure suits: {{these were}} pioneered by Wiley Post in his Lockheed Vega 5b from September 1934 onwards. He was able {{ultimately}} to sustain flights of several hours at over 15,000m (49,000ft). Others used pressure <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> set records with {{up and down}} flights, like F.R. Swain (15,230m or 49,970ft) in the Bristol 138 in September 1936 and Mario Pezzi (17,083m or 56,047ft) in a Caproni Ca.161bis in October 1938. Post's work showed sustained high-altitude flight was possible, but pressure suits were uncomfortable and restrictive.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Healthways retailed Carib drysuits, made of 3-ply {{translucent}} gum rubber, {{and available}} in {{long and short}} versions. Entry was by a front chute with rubber band closure. The full version included an integral hood and covered the feet. In 1957, they added the Aqua King and Aqua Flite dry <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> their product range. The Aqua King suit was a full-length waist entry suit, comprising hood, long sleeved shirt, booted pants and waistline sealing ring, and was made of seamless latex rubber. All these suits were available in small medium and large sizes.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{researchers}} from NASA used {{their experience with}} the fabrication of space <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> develop a special suit that would allow Vetter {{to get out of}} his bubble and walk in the outside world. The suit was connected to his bubble via an eight-foot (2.5 m) long cloth tube and although cumbersome, it allowed him to venture outside without serious risk of contamination. Vetter was initially resistant to the suit, and although he later became more comfortable wearing it, he used it only seven times. He outgrew the suit and never used the replacement one provided for him by NASA.|$|E
50|$|To help Superman, Jimmy calls Dr. Serling Roquette of S.T.A.R. Labs {{and asks}} {{her for a}} way to stop Livewire. Dr. Roquette tells Jimmy that Livewire's {{increased}} power is affecting her mind and {{that the only way to}} stop her is using a containment <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> dissipate Livewire's excessive power. Superman intercepts the call with his super-hearing and goes to the Fortress of Solitude. There, he finds the suit he used when he was an energy being. He takes the <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> S.T.A.R.

5000|$|Rupp, a very superstitious man, {{was known}} to carry a [...] "lucky" [...] buckeye in his pocket. His {{favorite}} sign of good luck was finding a pin, especially a bobby pin, particularly on a game day. The depth of his superstitious nature was revealed while he was coaching at Freeport, when he had bought a new blue <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> replace his old brown one. He wore his new <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> a game, and his team got beaten badly. Rupp never again wore anything but a brown <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> games.|$|R

25|$|To {{end their}} body shape campaign, Trinny, Susannah and 100 women {{go to the}} {{hillside}} chalk carving, the Long Man of Wilmington, where Trinny parades a made over woman from each shape category. Meanwhile in the distance, Susannah organizes the others into changing {{the shape of the}} Long Man into a more feminine one by lying down in white boiler <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> give the symbol pigtails, hips and breasts. The event does not come without protest, where Pagans gather in an attempt to stop the proceedings. The episode ends with Trinny and Susannah taking off in a helicopter to view the Long Man with a female form.|$|E
25|$|The Zoozoos are small-bodied, thin women {{covered in}} layers of white fabric. Each facial {{expression}} {{is made of}} rubber and pasted on the actors {{to cut down on}} the time and cost for shoot. The effect was achieved by a variety of methods including choosing the right material for the body <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> ensure that there were no wrinkles when the characters moved, shooting the footage at lower framerates and keeping backgrounds simple in terms of details and the use of a neutral tone of grey. The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|E
25|$|According to Phillips, Edward's {{choice of}} clothes were {{specific}} and he rebelled against {{what his father}} dictated as the protocol for dresses. He used to wear navy blue tails, rather than black ones, as formalwear. The designer {{was able to see}} the original ones he owned at the National Museum of Costume. To re-create the look, Phillips contacted luxury goods company Alfred Dunhill who had an understanding of bespoke tailoring available in London's Savile Row. They provided Phillips with tailor, wools and fabrics from the mills that had created the original fabrics for Edward himself. Phillips tailored the baggy looks of the 1930s <b>suits,</b> <b>to</b> make them appealing for the contemporary audience. In the end, all the costumes were hand-made, with a total of 60costumes being created for Simpson and 30for Edward.|$|E
