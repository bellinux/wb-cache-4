40|$|The {{validity}} of a charter provision giving {{the directors of}} a corporation the unrestricted power to purchase, retire, or cancel common stock at will was challenged by a newly retired employee whose stock had been called by the company.

Plaintiff’s refusal {{to comply with the}} corporate decree was based upon his contention that the broad power of the call provision created an unreasonable “restraint on alienation. ” However, plaintiff had been an officer and director of the corporation for over 25 years, and had voted for the adoption of the challenged provision.

50|$|A travel agency's main {{function}} is {{to act as an}} agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. A package holiday or a ticket is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase. The holiday or ticket is supplied to the agency at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is supplied to the agent. This is known as the commission. In many countries, all individuals or companies that sell tickets are required to be licensed as a travel agent.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the inventory control of items that can be considered independent of one another. The decisions when to order and in what quantity, are the controllable or independent variables in cost expressions which are minimised. The four systems considered are referred to as (Q, R), (nQ,R,T), (M,T) and (M,R,T). Wiith ((Q,R) a fixed quantity Q is ordered each time the order cover (i. e. <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> plus on order) equals or falls below R, the re-order level. With the other three systems reviews are made only at intervals of T. With (nQ,R,T) an order for nQ is placed if on review the inventory cover is {{less than or equal to}} R, where n, which is an integer, is chosen at the time so that the new order cover just exceeds R. In (M, T) each order increases the order cover to M. Fnally in (M, R, T) when on review, order cover does not exceed R, enough is ordered to increase it to M. The (Q, R) system is examined at several levels of complexity, so that the theoretical savings in inventory costs obtained with more exact models could be compared with the increases in computational costs. Since the exact model was preferable for the (Q,R) system only exact models were derived for theoretical systems for the other three. Several methods of optimization were tried, but most were found inappropriate for the exact models because of non-convergence. However one method did work for each of the exact models. Demand is considered continuous, and with one exception, the distribution assumed is the normal distribution truncated so that demand is never less than zero. Shortages are assumed to result in backorders, not lost sales. However, the shortage cost is a function of three items, one of which, the backorder cost, may be either a linear, quadratic or an exponential function of the length of time of a backorder, with or without period of grace. Lead times are assumed constant or gamma distributed. Lastly, the actual supply quantity is allowed to be distributed. All the sets of equations were programmed for a KDF 9 computer and the computed performances of the four inventory control procedures are compared under each assurnption...|$|E

40|$|The {{vast and}} complex field of {{technological}} discoveries and inventions require {{more and more}} protection mainly towards the rights of their owners. IPRs such as a patent, trademark or copyright, {{play a major role}} in the global development of economics and high finance. The primary reason for my paper concerns the question and thereby the title, “What Protection is afforded a Licensor or a Licensee with regard to Perfected Property Rights in Bankruptcy?” The paper is divided into five separate parts. The first part describes the problem and purpose as I see it. It also looks at Licence Agreements, Perfected Property Rights, and to what extent a Bankruptcy Estate can claim an IPR, and whether or not an IPR and the licence right to an IPR can be transferred. The second part is the heart of the paper where I discuss the Perfected Property Rights of a Licensee in the bankruptcy estate of a Licensor. I have highlighted the perfected property rights of a licensee primarily concerning patents. I have discussed the rights and protection available to a licensee against a new owner. I arrived at the fact that there is two ways of dealing with the problems. Firstly there is the traditional principle known in Sweden as “Loss of right to use through acquisition”, i. e., a right to the use of a movable property will be made null and void as a new owner takes president over the right to use. Secondly, there is the principle of priority or agreement. This principle of priority means that the first legal act has precedent. To emphasise this principle of priority I have made analogies within the area of the pledging of a patent. I have also compared the theories of whether or not the traditional principle “Loss of right to use through acquisition” or the principle of priority should apply. This was for me, the most important and actual question, and I see it as a problem in Sweden that needs attention. As there is no available legislation in Sweden I compared our way of dealing with these problems to the legislative way of dealing with the same problems in the USA. As the technical development emerged in the US it follows that they have attained the most experience concerning legal questions in the field of IPRs. The third part concerns the perfected property rights of a licensor in a bankruptcy of a licensee and I have even described perfected property rights with regard to the purchase of IPRs. I have made an analogy with the Swedish Sales Act. I have taken part of the conclusions available from literature and the ideas and theories concerning perfected property rights with regard to the right of publishing, and that it should be considered valid also for patent licence agreements. I also found it relevant to discuss the Swedish case NJA 1966 p 241 concerning the right of publishing within a bankruptcy estate and the sale of the <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> The fourth part looks at the US Bankruptcy Act, focusing on the New Intellectual Property Bankruptcy Protection Act. The US has enacted legislation on behalf of IPR licensing to protect a licensee so that a licensee can continue to use a licence after the bankruptcy of a licensor. The fifth and final part is the analysis, where I have brought together Swedish judicial preparatory works, US legislation, Swedish principles and discussions. The result will hopefully support my theory that we have a problem in this area in Sweden today that need to be solved. I believe that we should follow the example of USA and legislate...|$|E

40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for a Delaware corporation’s stock records to have {{omissions}} or procedural defects raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers would likely attempt to cure the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder ratification. However, in a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and the court has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> question void, i. e., not curable by ratification. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded the necessary certainty to allow practitioners to decide whether a particular defect <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> issuance is a substantive defect that renders stock void or a mere technical defect that renders stock voidable. This Article analyzes the cases giving rise to this lack of clarity and proposes that the Delaware courts apply the policy underlying Article 8 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code to validate <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of innocent purchasers for value <b>in</b> determining whether <b>stock</b> is void or voidable...|$|R
