40|$|The {{retrospective}} {{identification of}} preseizure states usually bases on a time-resolved characterization of dynamical aspects of multichannel neurophysiologic recordings {{that can be}} assessed with measures from linear or non-linear time series analysis. This approach renders time profiles of a characterizing measure - so-called measure profiles - for different recording sites or combinations thereof. Various downstream evaluation techniques have been proposed to single out measure profiles that carry potential information about preseizure states. These techniques, however, rely on assumptions about <b>seizure</b> <b>precursor</b> dynamics {{that might not be}} generally valid or face the statistical problem of multiple testing. Addressing these issues, we have developed a method to preselect measure profiles that carry potential information about preseizure states, and to identify brain regions associated with <b>seizure</b> <b>precursor</b> dynamics. Our data-driven method is based on the ratio S of the global to local temporal variance of measure profiles. We evaluated its suitability by retrospectively analyzing long-lasting multichannel intracranial EEG recordings from 18 patients that included 133 focal onset seizures, using a bivariate measure for the strength of interactions. In 17 / 18 patients, we observed S to be significantly correlated with the predictive performance of measure profiles assessed retrospectively by means of receiver-operating-characteristic statistics. Predictive performance was higher for measure profiles preselected with S than for a manual selection using information about onset and spread of seizures. Across patients, highest predictive performance was not restricted to recordings from focal areas, thus supporting the notion of an extended epileptic network in which even distant brain regions contribute to seizure generation. We expect our method to provide further insight into the complex spatial and temporal aspects of the seizure generating process.

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to (1) develop and apply efficient algorithms to simultaneous intracranial electroencephalographic signals recorded from multiple implanted electrode sites to evaluate the spatial and temporal behavior of <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors</b> and (2) to demonstrate the utility of multiple feature and channel synergy for predicting epileptic seizures in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Short-term <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors</b> within a 10 -minute time period are investigated. The method consists of preprocessing, processing, feature selection, classification, and validation steps. The preprocessing step removes extraneous data and captures the salient signal attributes while maintaining the integrity of the signal. Processing is a three-step approach that includes first-level features extracted from the raw data, second-level features extracted from first level features, and third-level features extracted from second-level features. A genetic algorithm selects the optimal features off-line from a preselected group of features to serve as the input to the classifier.

30|$|Due to the {{inherent}} intra- and inter-patient seizure heterogeneities and EEG non-stationarity, {{it is difficult}} to measure the modulations of neuronal network interactions using <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors.</b> To solve this problem, Stamoulis et al. studied the pre-ictal neuro-modulations corresponding to temporal and/or frontal lobe seizures. They used information theoretic features like entropy and mutual information extracted from two frequency ranges (the range that is {{less than or equal to}} 100  Hz and the range that is greater than 100  Hz) of awake scalp EEGs[29]. They succeeded to measure pre-ictal modulations at frequencies greater than 100  Hz with high specificity.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the suitability of}} selected measures of complexity based on recurrence quantification analysis and recurrence networks for an identification of pre-seizure states in multi-day, multi-channel, invasive electroencephalographic recordings from five epilepsy patients. We employ several statistical techniques to avoid spurious findings due to various influencing factors and due to multiple comparisons and observe precursory structures in three patients. Our findings indicate a high congruence among measures in identifying <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors</b> and emphasize the current notion of seizure generation in large-scale epileptic networks. A final judgment of the suitability for field studies, however, requires evaluation on a larger database. (c) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of epileptic <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors</b> has potential clinical relevance. It is conjectured that seizures may {{be represented by}} dynamical bifurcations and that an adequate order parameter to characterize brain dynamics is the phase difference in the oscillatory activity of neural systems. In this study, the critical point hypothesis that seizures, or more generally periods of widespread high synchronization, represent bifurcations is empirically tested by monitoring the growth of fluctuations in the putative order parameter of phase differences between magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic signals in nearby brain regions in patients with epilepsy and normal subjects during hyperventilation. Implications of the results with regard to epileptic phenomena are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{translation}} of our Wilson–Cowan model predictions—namely critical slowing near bifurcation onset—into real clinical applications {{will not be}} trivial. Under the very strictly controlled conditions of the in vitro brain slice, we were only able to see clear frequency changes in our local field potential recordings (Fig.  9) after going to the utmost lengths to suppress experimental noise (such as electrode drift, electromagnetic interference, vibration-induced artifacts, ground loops). This is because the subthreshold fluctuations are orders of magnitude smaller than the huge nonlinear oscillations that erupt beyond the bifurcation point. Nevertheless, our model does indicate an alternative approach to seizure prediction: current attempts at seizure prediction have concentrated on the detection of very high frequency oscillations as <b>seizure</b> <b>precursors</b> [41]; we suggest {{that it might be}} profitable to look instead at changes in very low temporal and spatial frequencies as indicators of imminent seizure.|$|R

40|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} diseases. Increase of epilepsy occurrence in elderly patients was first noted in 1975. Cerebrovascular diseases should be particularly noticed among various causes of the disease. However, most studies have been focused on analysis of hemorrhagic strokes. Meanwhile, the cases of ischemic strokes are of particular interest as they are associated with elderly epilepsy. 52 patients with post-stroke epilepsy were observed. Peculiarities of epileptic seizures in patients with post-stroke epilepsy have been shown, and also association between the types of seizures and the time of their development has been revealed. It has been shown that there is a group of patients with <b>seizures</b> - <b>precursors.</b> EEG peculiarities in patients with post-strokeepilepsy have been revealed.

50|$|Amphetamine is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} of the phenethylamine class that is approved {{for the treatment of}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine refers to equal parts of the enantiomers, i.e., 50% levoamphetamine and 50% dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine is also used as a performance and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. Although it is a prescription medication in many countries, unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine is often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with uncontrolled or heavy use. As a consequence, amphetamine is illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold. Based upon drug and drug <b>precursor</b> <b>seizures</b> worldwide, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulates {{neurogenesis}} in the normal dentate gyrus (DG) via Y 1 receptors (Howell et al., 2003, 2005). This regulation may be relevant to epilepsy, because seizures increase both NPY expression and precursor cell proliferation in the DG. Therefore, the effects of NPY on DG precursors were evaluated in normal conditions and after status epilepticus. In addition, potentially distinct NPY responsive precursors were identified, and an analysis performed {{not only of the}} DG, but also the caudal subventricular zone (cSVZ) and subcallosal zone (SCZ) where <b>seizures</b> modulate glial <b>precursors.</b> We show a proliferative effect of NPY on multipotent nestin cells expressing the stem cell marker Lewis-X from both the DG and the cSVZ/SCZ in-vitro. We confirm an effect on proliferation in the cSVZ/SCZ of Y 1 receptor -/- mice and demonstrate a significant reduction in basal and seizure-induced proliferation in the DG of NPY-/- mice. Our results show that NPY is a modulator of seizure induced neurogenesis and gliogenesis in a hippocampal region specific manner. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} public concern and legislative activity surrounding {{the issue of}} domestic methamphetamine production. What has not been extensively examined is the broader context within which domestic methamphetamine production takes place. This study utilizes geographic location data on 14, 448 seized methamphetamine laboratories to document the association between the presence of methamphetamine labs and economic factors, social factors, and crime. The study shows that laboratory seizures spiked upward immediately prior {{to the implementation of}} legislation restricting access to methamphetamine precursor drugs and declined immediately after the legislation was passed, remaining well below pre-regulation levels. However, {{more than a third of}} U. S. counties reported laboratory <b>seizures</b> after strict <b>precursor</b> regulations were in place, suggesting that while the problem of local methamphetamine lab production was diminished by precursor regulation, it was not eliminated. The study also examined factors most strongly associated with the seizure of methamphetamine laboratories at the county level. Economic instability was not a good predictor of the presence of methamphetamine labs, nor were spatial or geographic variables. In general, counties with higher lab seizure rates tended to have a predominantly White, English-speaking population with a substantial representation of evangelical churches. Methamphetamine laboratory counties also tended to have employment based on manufacturing, a larger farm population, single-female-headed households, a higher than average property crime rate, be more racially segregated, have a population that moved into the household within th...|$|R

Differences in intrinsic progenitor cell activity could underlie these different expansion capacities. Thus, we compared the renewal- expansion and multipotency of dentate gyrus and CA 1 precursors isolated in vitro. We found that the dissected CA 1 region, including the periventricular zone, is enriched in neurosphere-forming cells (presumed stem cells), which respond to either EGF or FGF- 2. Dentate gyrus contains fewer neurosphere-forming cells and none that respond to FGF- 2 alone. Neurospheres generated from CA 1 were multipotent and produced neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, while dentate gyrus neurospheres mostly produced glial cells. The analysis of the effects of EGF on organotypic cultures of hippocampal slices depicted similar features: BrdU and Nestin immunoreactivities increased after EGF treatment in CA 1 but not in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that CA 1 precursors are more stem-cell-like than granule cell precursors, which may represent a more restricted precursor cell...|$|R
