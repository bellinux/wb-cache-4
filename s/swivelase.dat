40|$|We have {{examined}} the influence of VM 26 (teniposide), a specific inhibitor of mammalian type II DNA topoisomerase, on the replication of SV 40 minichromosomes in vitro. The replication system we used consists of replicative intermediate SV 40 chromatin as substrate which is converted to mature SV 40 chromatin {{in the presence of}} ATP, deoxynucleotides and a protein extract from uninfected cells. The addition of 100 microM VM 26 to this system reduces DNA synthesis to 70 to 80 percent of the control and leads to an accumulation of 'late replicative intermediates'. The VM 26 induced block of replication was not released by the addition of large quantities of type I DNA topoisomerase. We conclude, that type II DNA topoisomerase is essential for the final replication steps leading from late Cairns structures of replicative intermediates to monomeric minichromosomes. It appears that type I DNA topoisomerase can function as a <b>swivelase</b> during most of the replicative elongation phase, but must later be replaced by type II DNA topoisomerase...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} that DNA replication initiates {{from the region}} containing an autonomously replicating sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae when negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA is incubated with the proteins required for simian virus 40 DNA replication (Y. Ishimi and K. Matsumoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 : 5399 - 5403, 1993). In this study, the DNAs containing initiation zones from mammalian cells were replicated in this model system. When negatively supercoiled DNA containing an initiation zone (2 kb) upstream of the human c-myc gene was incubated with simian virus 40 T antigen as a DNA helicase, HSSB (also called replication protein A), and DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex isolated from HeLa cells, DNA replication was specifically initiated {{from the center of}} the initiation zone, which was elongated bidirectionally in the presence of a DNA <b>swivelase.</b> Without HSSB, the level of DNA synthesis was significantly reduced and the localized initiation could not be detected, indicating that HSSB plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication. The digestion of negatively supercoiled template DNA with a single-strand-specific nuclease revealed that HSSB stimulated DNA unwinding in the center of the initiation zone where the DNA duplex is relatively unstable. In contrast, DNA replication started from a broad region of an initiation zone downstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene from chinese hamster ovary cells, but the center of the region was mapped near the origin of bidirectional DNA replication. These results suggested that this system mimics a fundamental process of initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication. The mechanism of initiation is discussed...|$|E
