Then a comparison of the new method with the current method will be done. The method selected in this master thesis is to make the test specifications in MSCs and SDL diagrams.

Head bent, Rose busied herself with knotting strands of her own shaven hair. The bravura performance took place inside a glass cabinet.

In doing the piece, I had to confront what I wasn't <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> my body. The work is a cleansing act, a coming out.

In Span I, the complementary part of the piece, a red-overalled prisoner incised text on to the opposite wall of the gallery, memories from Rose's childhood, often dealing with the role that hair, how straight it was, how curly, and thus how it defined race, had played in her childhood.

40|$|Arbitration clauses, {{which are}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away <b>with</b> litigation, have {{ironically}} spawned many complicated and expensive court fights. Some {{of the most}} complex cases involve both forum shopping by the parties and jurisdictional turf battles between federal and state courts. Federal courts have, on quite a few occasions, actually {{gone so far as to}} enjoin a state court from continuing to consider a pending case because the federal court concluded that the matter ought to be arbitrated. The Supreme Court, however, has never ruled on whether or when such 2 ̆ 2 arbitral antisuit injunctions 2 ̆ 2 are permissible. In Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., the Supreme Court expressly reserved ruling on the question of whether, given abstention principles, federal courts 2 ̆ 2 might stay a state-court suit pending arbitration, 2 ̆ 2 and the Court has not come back to the question since then. This Article thus attempts to determine when, if ever, federal courts should be permitted to enjoin state court determinations in order to allow arbitration to proceed. This article concludes by arguing that the federal courts 2 ̆ 7 typical failure to apply many of the doctrines that might preclude arbitral injunctions or to draw the factual distinctions set out above is symptomatic of courts 2 ̆ 7 frequent over-enthusiasm for contractual arbitration. This failure may also allow big businesses to gain an unfair advantage over 2 ̆ 2 little guys. 2 ̆ 2 As I have argued elsewhere, it is by no means clear that courts 2 ̆ 7 extreme preference for arbitration over litigation is supported either by the legislative history of the FAA or by policy considerations. Instead, where federal courts issue arbitral antisuit injunctions in defiance of dominant principles of federalism and comity, federal courts disparage state courts 2 ̆ 7 capacity for fairness more seriously than can be justified by the federal supremacy interest. In effect, the federal courts are making an invidious comparison between the state forum and an arbitral forum in the guise of resolving a jurisdictional conflict between the federal and state forums. Moreover, this preference for arbitration over litigation raises constitutional concerns. Thus, it is crucial that federal courts carefully consider the permissibility of antisuit injunctions in light of the relevant jurisdictional doctrines and the particular facts of each case...|$|R
5000|$|With Don Jaime hardly {{contactable}} in Austria following {{outbreak of}} the Great War, the Mellistas took almost full control of the party; the Carlist Cortes campaigns of 1914, 1916 and 1918 were visibly marked by Mellista-nurtured long-term strategy. With dramatically declining turnover at the polls and growing fragmentation of two partidos turnistas, it was becoming evident that political system of Restauración was crumbling. Mella nurtured a plan for minimalist alliance of the Right, leading in turn to emergence of a maximalist ultra-Right party, possibly a new incarnation of Traditionalism. That formation was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away <b>with</b> liberal democracy - a strategy dubbed by some scholars as [...] "catastrofismo" [...] - and ensure passage to Traditionalist, corporative system, with dynastical question parked in obscurity. Though in 1914 provincial jefes were largely left free to conclude any electoral alliances that might produce best possible results, Vázquez de Mella and Maura kept working that they took form of Carlist-Maurist accords. During the 1916 campaign Vázquez de Mella {{for the first time}} explicitly referred to a future union of extrema derecha, new terms like [...] "mauro-mellistas", [...] "mauro-jaimistas" [...] or [...] "carlomauristas" [...] entered into circulation and Maura started to make vague anti-system references of altering [...] "ambiente de la vida pública". The strategy, however, demonstrated its limitations. Alliances did not outlive electoral campaigns; Jaimist candidates kept winning around 10 mandates, hardly an impressive improvement compared to the 1890s or 1900s; finally, in regions with strong local identity some party militants grumbled that fuerismo might suffer in a hypothetical ultra-Right alliance. Following {{outbreak of the}} Great War earlier demonstrated pro-German Mellist sympathies turned into a full-blown campaign. Though booklets or lectures technically supported Spanish neutrality, they raised sentiment favoring Central Powers and aimed against Britain. After 1916, when pro-Entente feelings were gaining strength, the focus of Mellistas shifted to preventing a would-be Spanish joining the Allies. The claimant, during most of the war unreachable in his Austrian residence, remained ambiguous; officially he supported neutrality, in private leaning towards Entente and sending notes not disavowing pro-German tones of the Mellistas. Scholars differ as to how the World War One issue related to Mellismo. Very few consider it central and even reduce the outlook to pro-German stance. Most suggest that it stemmed from ideological Mellista vision, quote passages praising anti-Liberal German regime and lambasting Masonic, democratic, parliamentarian British and French systems. Some comments suggest that victory of the Central Powers was expected to facilitate takeover of Spanish political scene by extreme Right, while there are students who suggest that the war issue was of no relevance at all.|$|R
