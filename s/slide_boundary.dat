Observations of grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> along <b>boundaries</b> with {{different}} misorientations were made. It was established that Sigma = 9 coincidence <b>boundary</b> <b>slides</b> faster than <b>boundaries</b> of general type. Grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> along coincidence <b>boundary</b> was activated at higher stress {{and only in}} the presence of intragranular slip. Sliding along coincidence and near-coincidence boundaries is accompanied by regular <b>boundary</b> migration whereas <b>sliding</b> along general <b>boundary</b> is not. The sliding-migration behavior of coincidence boundaries was explained in terms of DSC-dislocations associated with steps. <b>Sliding</b> along general <b>boundaries</b> was described in terms of non-DSC grain boundary dislocations having infinitesimal Burgers vector. It is established in bicrystals with individual boundaries that crystallographic slip can increase significantly the rate of grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding.</b> Two mechanisms of stimulation of sliding by slip are proposed. Intragranular slip can make a direct contribution to grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> in incompatible conditions of deformation. Identical deformation of grains can increase the rate of sliding only by its accommodation at boundary irregularities. The close relationship between sliding and slip at incompatible deformation makes intragranular slip strongly dependent on boundary structure and geometry of slip and independent of the Schmid factor. It is demonstrated that deformation of textured fine-grained Zn- 1. 1 %Al alloy in the direction favorable for intragranular slip decreases the contribution of grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> to the total strain. Deformation in the direction unfavorable for slip increases its contribution. This shows that grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and intragranular slip are concurrent and independent processes during superplastic deformation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} model is suggested which describes structural and behavioral features of grain boundary dislocation configurations near triple junctions in nano- and polycrystalline materials. With the elastic interaction between grain boundary dislocations taken into account, we have theoretically examined deviations of spatial arrangement of boundary dislocations near triple junctions, from a periodic arrangement. Also, the local migration of grain boundaries near their triple junctions has been theoretically described, induced by grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> in mechanically loaded nano- and polycrystalline materials. In {{the framework of}} the model, the key driving force for the local migration is a release of the elastic energy of ensemble of gliding boundary dislocations (carriers of grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding)</b> and immobile <b>boundary</b> dislocations (associated with grain boundary misorientation).

Olivine, (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4, is the most prevalent mineral in Earth’s upper mantle, which is why we have chosen it for our study. The sliding of olivine along the grains’ boundaries is an important mode of movement in the mantle. However, direct measurements of the amount grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> have not been taken and this prevents accurate modeling of the motion within Earth.

40|$|In {{naturally}} deformed upper mantle rocks {{a strong}} olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) occurs in rocks with grain sizes {{larger than about}} 15 mm. Finer grained peridotites tend to have weak to random olivine CPO. The different types of olivine CPO are usually interpreted {{in relation to the}} dominant deformation mechanisms: with a strong CPO indicating dislocation creep and a random CPO indicating grain size sensitive (GSS) mechanisms involving grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and diffusion creep. Here we report the occurrence of a weak but systematic olivine CPO in ultra-fine-grained (0. 5 e 10 mm) ultramylonites from the Étang de Lers lherzolite, Pyrenees, France. The microstructures, with elongated grains and mixed distribution of phases in the ultramylonites indicate deformation by dominant GSS creep. In theory, an olivine CPO may develop in rocks deformed by GSS creep during dislocation accommodated <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> or phase <b>boundary</b> controlled diffusion creep in pyroxene-rich rocks. Alternatively, the CPO may be a relict texture preserved because the elongated grain shapes limit rotation during grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding.</b> Our observations confirm theoretical and experimental studies, which predict that systematic CPO and an associated seismic anisotropy can occur in naturally deformed upper mantle rocks during deformation by grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and diffusion creep...|$|R

Particularly challenging therein are organs which slide along each other. They require discontinuous transform mappings at the <b>sliding</b> <b>boundaries</b> to be accurately aligned. In this paper, we present a novel approach for discontinuity preserving image registration. We base our method on a sparse kernel machine (SKM), where reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces serve as transformation models. We introduce a bilateral regularization term, where neighboring transform parameters are considered jointly. This regularizer enforces a bias to homogeneous regions in the transform mapping and simultaneously preserves discontinuous magnitude changes of parameter vectors pointing in equal directions. We prove a representer theorem for the overall cost function including this bilateral regularizer in order to guarantee a finite dimensional solution. In addition, we build direction-dependent basis functions within the SKM framework in order to elongate the transformations along the potential <b>sliding</b> organ <b>boundaries.</b> In the experiments, we evaluate the registration results of our method on a 4 DCT dataset and show superior registration performance of our method over the tested methods...|$|R

The experiment {{is designed to}} separate different effects of intragranular slip on the <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and establish their mechanisms. Grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> with and without development of intragranular slip is observed. The rate of sliding accompanied by slip is {{more than five times}} of that without slip. A good correlation between the <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and intragranular slip prior to slide hardening is established. Slide hardening followed by the negative sliding near one end of the boundary and strain hardening in the boundary vicinity, are observed at the last stages of deformation. For the case of formation of slip induced glissile grain boundary dislocations of opposite signs the possibility of their contribution to total grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding,</b> is analyzed. The effect of the increase in the rate of sliding is explained in terms of the accommodation of sliding by slip and appearance of additional glissile grain boundary dislocations of one sign due to strain incompatibility. Contribution of these different dislocation mechanisms to the increase in the sliding rate is determined for the stage of deformation preceding slide hardening. It is supposed that the effect of slide hardening and negative sliding as well as boundary curving is created by non-smooth boundary and small degree of incompatibility caused by straining...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is mostly}} {{accepted}} that {{the lower part of}} the ice shell of Europa is actively convective, there is still much uncertainty about the flow mechanism dominating the rheology of this convective layer, which largely depends on the grain size of the ice. In this work, we examined thermal equilibrium states in a tidally heated and strained convective shell, for two rheologies sensitive to grain size, grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and diffusion creep. If we take a lower limit of 70 mWm− 2 for the surface heat flow, according to some geological features observed, the ice grain size should be less than 2 or 0. 2 mm for grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> or diffusion creep respectively. If in addition the thickness of the ice shell is constrained to a few tens of kilometers and it is assumed that the thickness of the convective layer is related to lenticulae spacing, then grain sizes between 0. 2 and 2 mm for grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding,</b> and between 0. 1 and 0. 2 mm for diffusion creep are obtained. Also, local convective layer thicknesses deduced from lenticulae spacing are more similar to those here derived for grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding.</b> Our results thus favor grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> as the dominant rheology for the water ice in Europa’s convective layer, since this flow mechanism is able to satisfy the imposed constraints for a wider range of grain sizes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Optimal {{structural}} superplasticity and the {{deformation of}} nanostruc-tured {{materials in the}} thermally activated region are regarded as being caused by the same physical process. In this analysis, grain/interphase <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> con-trols the rate of deformation {{at the level of}} atomistics. <b>Boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> develops to a mesoscopic level by plane interface formation involving two or more boundaries and at this stage the rate controlling step is boundary migration. In other words, grain/interphase <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> is viewed as a two-scale process. The non-zero, unbalanced shear stresses present at the grain/interphase boundaries ensure that near-random grain rotation is also a non-rate controlling concomitant of this mecha-nism. Expressions have been derived for the free energy of activation for the atomic scale rate controlling process, the threshold stress that should be crossed for the commencement of mesoscopic <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding,</b> the inverse Hall–Petch effect and the steady state rate equation connecting the strain rate to the independent vari-ables of stress, temperature and grain size. Beyond the point of inflection in the log stress–log strain rate plot, climb controlled multiple dislocation motion within the grains becomes increasingly important and at sufficiently high stresses becomes rate controlling. The predictions have been validated experimentally...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} deformation behavior of high temperature alloys with an aim to understand creep damage and fracture mechanics of these materials. First, we study the creep fatigue deformation {{of a unified}} viscoplastic material subjected to uniaxial cyclic loading using a dynamical system approach. We find oscillation of back stress significantly increases the inelastic strain accumulation in a cyclic test. The accumulated inelastic strain at long times {{are sensitive to the}} initial condition (e. g. whether one starts with tension or compression). We define a ratcheting ratio to quantify the interaction of creep and cyclic plasticity on the accumulated inelastic strain per cycle. The second part of the dissertation focuses on solving the asymptotic stress and strain field near the tip of a plane strain Mode I stationary crack in a viscoplastic material. For small scale creep where the region of inelasticity is small in comparison with typical specimen dimensions, our asymptotic and finite element analysis show that the near tip stress field has the same singularity as elastic power law creeping materials with a time dependent amplitude. This amplitude is found to vanish at long times and the elastic K field dominates. For the case of cyclic loading, we study the effect of stress ratio on inelastic strain and find that the strain accumulated per cycle decreases with stress ratio. iii The third part of the dissertation carries out finite element simulations on the planar deformation of random sized power law creeping grains with <b>sliding</b> and cavitating <b>boundaries.</b> Grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and grain <b>boundary</b> separation due to cavity nucleation and growth are incorporated into a cohesive zone model. Finite element simulation of a relaxation test shows that more grain boundary separation occurs in a microstructure with <b>sliding</b> resistant grain <b>boundaries</b> than in a microstructure with more freely <b>sliding</b> grain <b>boundaries.</b> The overall inelastic strain rate of the microstructure in uniaxial tension test is found to be greatly enhanced by grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and grain <b>boundary</b> cavitation. Finally, we extend the cohesive zone model in the third part of the dissertation to account for interface embrittlement caused by grain boundary impurities. Finite element simulation of an uniaxial creep test using a two dimensional random grain structure shows that grain boundary cavitation and interface embrittlement are two competing mechanisms for grain boundary separation. The occurrence of one grain boundary separation mode would slow down or even inhibit the other. iv 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R

In this work, creep behaviours of a tin-based composite solder reinforced by nano-sized metal particles and a lead-free Sn-Ag-Bi solder were characterized, with a comparison to Sn 60 Pb 40 solder. The {{results show that}} the nano-composite solder has much better creep resistance than Sn 60 Pb 40. The lead-free Sn-Ag-Bi solder has superior creep performance to both Sn 60 Pb 40 and nano-composite solders.

Sn 60 Pb 40 solder joints deform dominantly by transgranular sliding, while Sn-Ag-Bi and nano-composite solder joints creep by intergranular mechanism through grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and <b>boundary</b> voids growth. The mechanism of enhancing the creep resistance of nano-composite solder joints is that uniformly dispersed nano-sized particulates provide effective resistance by impeding grain <b>boundary</b> <b>sliding</b> and dislocation movement, besides the alloying effect of increasing elasticity modulus of the solder. ...|$|R
