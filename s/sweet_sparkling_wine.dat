40|$|The Brachetto {{variety is}} the most {{important}} aromatic red grape used for the production of <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in Italy. The phenolic composition and chromatic characteristics were studied in base and red <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made from this variety. The present work represents the first study on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> manufactured with Brachetto grapes. The amount of pigments extracted in the base wine was low {{as a consequence of the}} necessity for short maceration time (48. h) and low alcohol content (3. 0. bar) at the end of the second fermentation and, therefore, the chromatic quality was independent on the winemaking methodology used, excepting for lightness and color intensity. Response surface methodology was applied to predict the effect of two independent variables, namely time and temperature of storing, on the phenolic composition and chromatic properties in both lightly and fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> So, it is possible to evaluate the development of two types of <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> during their ageing in bottle and their commercial shelf-life. A central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used for this purpose. Quantitative changes were observed in the color parameters. Although the time variable strongly influenced them, the two <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> were stable enough only at low temperatures after 12. months of ageing. During the wine ageing in bottle, an increase in the formation of polymeric red pigments can be suggested taking into account the losses observed in monomeric anthocyanins. The results obtained showed that the color of fully <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> was more stable than that of lightly ones and, therefore, the shelf-life of the former ones could be longer...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} research examines {{the experiences and}} perceptions of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> amongst 50 members of Generation Y in Australia and New Zealand. Amongst this sample many young Australian females drink <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> frequently, while many young New Zealanders –male and female – ‘binge drink’ cheap, <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> Despite these trans‐Tasman differences in drinking patterns, the image of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> is the same across the cohort. <b>Sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{is seen as a}} ‘girls’ drink’, a drink for special occasions, and a social drink that makes the consumer ‘happy’. The paper concludes by outlining some areas for future research and implications for wine marketers and producers interested in attracting this youth market...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> [...] Asti spumante is {{made from}} the Moscato grape. The {{majority}} of the area's winemaking take places in the provinces of Cuneo, Asti and Alessandria. The Brachetto is another variety used for making <b>sweet</b> and <b>sparkling</b> red <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brachetto tend {{to produce}} light-bodied, highly {{aromatic}} wines with distinctive notes of strawberries. In the DOCG region of Brachetto d'Acqui, the grape {{is used to}} produce a slightly <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{that is similar to}} Lambrusco and is sometimes called the a light red equivalent of Moscato d'Asti.|$|E
5000|$|In Uruguay there's a {{beverage}} called [...] "Medio y Medio" [...] ("half and half") {{that consists}} of <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> and dry white wine in equal parts. [...] "Medio y medio" [...] comes in Red, Rosé and White varieties, the latter being the original and most popular. It is massively consumed during the holidays {{but it can be}} found in certain places throughout the year as well. The most common [...] "Medio y Medio" [...] is the one produced by Roldós, a local restaurant that claims having invented the mixture.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the Italian {{government}} {{designated the}} vineyards around the Sabine Hills as a DOC wine region eligible to produce red, white and rose wine {{as well as}} some <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> from white grape varieties. The grapes are limited to a harvest yields of 12 tonnes/ha. Red and rose wines are a blend of mostly 40-70% Sangiovese, 15-40% Montepulciano with other local varieties permitted up to 30%. The white wines are a blend of at least 40% Trebbiano and at least 40% Malvasia with other local grape varieties permitted to make up to 20% of the remaining blend. Red and rose wines must have a minimum alcohol level of 11% with whites having a minimum of 10.5%.|$|E
2500|$|... "Pink Champagne" [...] was a cheap, <b>sweet</b> {{version of}} <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{made in the}} 1950s and early 1960s because the American public thought Brut Champagne was too dry. Now discontinued.|$|R
25|$|Riesling is the {{benchmark}} grape in Germany and covers the most area in German vineyards. It is an aromatic variety {{with a high}} level of acidity that can be used for dry, semi-sweet, <b>sweet</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> The drawback to Riesling is that it takes 130 days to ripen and, in marginal years, the Riesling crop tends to be poor.|$|R
50|$|Vouvray {{is another}} Chenin blanc {{appellation}} which produces both <b>sweet,</b> dry and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> It is situated further upriver along the Loire, in the Touraine subregion. In comparison to sweet Vouvray, Coteaux du Layon wines {{tend to be}} more full-bodied, often sweeter, and slightly lower in acidity.|$|R
50|$|Due to the carbonation, Federweißer tastes quite refreshing, {{not unlike}} a light grape soda or a <b>sweet</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> As {{fermentation}} progresses, however, Federweißer may increasingly assume a darker, often amber-like or light brown hue. In general, Federweißer is made from white grapes; when made from red grapes, the drink is called Federroter, Roter Sauser, or Roter Rauscher. Federroter is less common than Federweißer.Because of rapid fermentation, Federweißer can not be stored for long and should be consumed {{within a few days}} of purchase. As carbonic acid is constantly produced, the bottles can not be sealed airtight and have a permeable lid (they would burst otherwise). They must be stored in an upright position to allow the gas to continuously escape from the bottle and to prevent spilling.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "wine stabilizer", {{potassium}} sorbate produces sorbic acid when added to wine. It serves two purposes. When active fermentation has ceased {{and the wine}} is racked for the final time after clearing, potassium sorbate renders any surviving yeast incapable of multiplying. Yeast living at that moment can continue fermenting any residual sugar into CO2 and alcohol, but when they die, no new yeast will be present to cause future fermentation. When a wine is sweetened before bottling, potassium sorbate is used to prevent refermentation when {{used in conjunction with}} potassium metabisulfite. It is primarily used with <b>sweet</b> <b>wines,</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> and some hard ciders, but may be added to table wines, which exhibit difficulty in maintaining clarity after fining.|$|R
40|$|Glycerol is {{the major}} {{by-product}} of ethanol fermentation and could be associated with wine quality. A simple method of assaying glycerol, glucose and fructose in wine by highperformance liquid chromatography using a modified polar bonded NH 2 -silica phase column and a refractive index detector {{was used to determine}} their concentrations in high- and standard-quality wines. Results show glycerol. fructose, and glucose levels ranged from 1. 65 to 9. 54, non-detect to 2. 57 and non-detect to 1. 63 g/L, respectively, for high-quality wines. For standard-quality wines, these levels ranged from 2. 67 to 8. 43, 1. 29 to 9. 12, and 0. 62 to 3. 60 g/L, respectively. Fructose and glucose levels (76. 2 ± 30. 8 and 43. 9 ± 18. 0 g/L, respectively) were much higher in <b>sweet</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines...</b>|$|R
500|$|Riesling {{is a white}} grape variety which {{originated}} in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, <b>sweet,</b> and <b>sparkling</b> white <b>wines.</b> Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling {{was estimated to be}} the world's 20th most grown variety at [...] (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the [...] "top three" [...] white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly [...] "terroir-expressive", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin.|$|R

50|$|Piedmont is {{a region}} where {{gathering}} nuts, mushrooms, cardoons and hunting and fishing takes place. Truffles, garlic, seasonal vegetables, cheese and rice are all used. Wines from the Nebbiolo grape such as Barolo and Barbaresco are produced as well as wines from the Barbera grape, fine <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> and the <b>sweet,</b> lightly <b>sparkling,</b> Moscato d'Asti. The region is also famous for its Vermouth and Ratafia production.|$|R
2500|$|While the {{majority}} of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> are white or rosé, Australia, Italy and Moldova all have a sizable production of red <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> Of these Italy have the longest tradition of red <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> such as Brachetto and semi sparkling Lambrusco. In Australia, red <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> are often made from the Shiraz grape.

25|$|The {{two major}} grape {{varieties}} of the Anjou are Chenin blanc, {{known locally as}} Pineau de la Loire, which is used for dry, <b>sweet,</b> still and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> and Cabernet Franc which is used mostly for rosé and still red wines. The sweet wine production of Anjou is highly dependent on favorable climate conditions and experiences marked vintage variation from year to year. The character of the vintage and climate will ultimately determine what type of wine will be produced. Many of the vineyards in the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs are located on sheltered slopes along tributaries of the Loire. In favorable vintages, the late summer and early fall months will bring climate conditions that encourage moisture and mist {{in the morning and}} enough sunshine in the afternoon to promote the development of favorable Botrytis cinerea rot instead of less desirable forms of grape rot. In exceptional years where there is enough warmth and dry weather during the harvest months, the grapes will be left on the vine to raisin in a process known as passerille. This method desiccates the wine, removing moisture and concentrating sugars, without adding the nuance of flavor that Botrytis does.|$|R
40|$|The foaming {{properties}} in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> are {{an indicator of}} quality {{as it is the}} first quality perception consumers have upon opening a bottle of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> Proteins, which are derived from both grapes and yeast during <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production, are known to impact the foaming {{properties in}} finished <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> The objectives of this project were to (1) understand the role and relationship that proteins have on the overall foaming properties and overall quality in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> (2) determine the role different yeast and grape clones from different varietals have on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality and (3) understand how bentonite affects <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality. The protein concentration in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> produced from Mariafeld Pinot noir appeared to impact the foaming properties. The longest elapsed time for foam dissipation was observed in the control treatment where bentonite was not used to strip protein and the shortest time was observed in the treatment where bentonite was used to remove grape and yeast proteins. In Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> the largest protein concentrations were observed in non-bentonite treated juices while the lowest were observed in the bentonite treatments. The prevalence of foam observed in both bentonite treatments, where grape proteins were completely removed, indicated that proteins derived over the course of secondary fermentation were foam forming in Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> It was also observed that different yeast, varietals, clones and soil compositions may impact the protein concentrations, chemical compositions and overall quality of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> The results of this research aim to better understand <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality to optimize production in the Niagara Peninsula...|$|R
