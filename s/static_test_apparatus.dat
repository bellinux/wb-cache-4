40|$|In {{order to}} improve trainees’ {{operational}} quality of <b>static</b> <b>test</b> of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile, a <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator is necessary to gain the goal.

40|$|Two <b>test</b> <b>apparatuses</b> were designed, built, and {{evaluated}} {{in order to}} study a proposed dynamic tissue puncture model. The <b>test</b> <b>apparatuses</b> were designed to improve existing experiments used previously to experimentally verify tissue models.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{for developing a}} tire suitable for performing small scale vehicle dynamics research is discussed. This will allow for physical verification of vehicle dynamics modelling and controls in environments where a full scale prototype is either not feasible or too large an investment. Currently, scale vehicle research {{is limited by the}} availability of tires on the desired scale, which are typically sourced from the radio controlled (RC) vehicle industry. Use of these tires, however, results in poor similitude between the representative scale vehicle and the full scale vehicle. This is due to variations in the behaviour of the scale tire to the full scale tire. An existing analytical tire model known as the cornering force self-aligning torque model (CF/SAT), is analyzed and modifications to the model are proposed to allow it to be used for non-dimensional tire parameterization. The model is then non-dimensionalized, using Buckingham Pi theory, to allow for comparison of small scale tire performance to large scale tire performance. A <b>static</b> load-deflection tire <b>testing</b> <b>apparatus</b> named the Windsor Automotive Tire Tester (WATT) is also developed. This machine is used to analyze if it is possible to determine the CF/SAT parameters for a given tire without the use of full scale tire dynamic studies and regression analysis. A DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. RC airplane tire is then parameterized and modelled using relationships derived from the static tire data. The results of the tire model are compared with experimental data of the DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. tire in order to analyze the effectiveness of the approach. It was found {{that it was possible to}} estimate some tire parameters using this method, however, more research is required to fully parameterize the tire using static load-deflection data...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} realize a micro-mechanic {{performance}} test of biaxial tensile-bending-combined loading and {{solve the problem}} of incompatibility of <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> and observation apparatus, novel biaxial-combined tensile-bending micro-mechanical performance <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> was designed. The working principle and major functions of key constituent parts of <b>test</b> <b>apparatus,</b> including the servo drive unit, clamping unit and test system, were introduced. Based on the finite element method, biaxial tensile and tension-bending-combined mechanical performances of the test-piece were studied as guidance to learn the distribution of elastic deformation and plastic deformation of all sites of the test-piece and to better plan test regions. Finally, this <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> was used to conduct a biaxial tensile test under different pre-bending loading and a tensile test at different rates; the image of the fracture of the test-piece was acquired by a scanning electron microscope and analyzed. It was indicated that as the pre-bending force rises, the elastic deformation phase would gradually shorten and the slope of the elastic deformation phase curve would slightly rise so that a yield limit would appear ahead of time. Bending speed could exert a positive and beneficial influence on tensile strength but weaken fracture elongation. If bending speed is appropriately raised, more ideal anti-tensile strength could be obtained, but fracture elongation would decline...|$|R
