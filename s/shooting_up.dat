5|$|Wyatt {{had been}} an {{assistant}} marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, {{along with a few}} other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight in October 1881, he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas during the summer of 1878.|$|E

25|$|On 13 August 1918, Lt. Hamilton led {{his flight}} {{on a special}} mission against Varssenaere aerodrome. He dropped four bombs from 200 feet on some {{aeroplane}} hangars, making two direct hits and causing {{a large amount of}} damage. He then machine gunned the German officers' billets and made four circuits of the aerodrome, <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> various targets. On the first circuit, he destroyed one EA on the ground which burst into flames when he shot it up. On the third circuit he repeated this performance, setting afire another Fokker biplane. His dash and skill very materially helped in the success of the operation. In addition this officer destroyed a Fokker biplane over Armentières on 7 August 1918. On 12 July he brought down two EA in flames and on two other occasions has driven down out of control enemy machines. He is an excellent patrol leader.|$|E
25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> his nose almost, {{and it was kind}} of like very disorienting.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{wrote that}} [...] "as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting {{from the large}} cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford {{were more or less}} born into their roles, and {{director}} Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do, instead of posing them in front of special effects." [...] He lamented [...] however that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, [...] "here is more genuine suspense when [...] starts <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> the town than when countless aliens appear". Salons Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was, however, critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it [...] "a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up".|$|E

500|$|The {{day began}} with a four-hour {{artillery}} and mortar bombardment and all indications were of an attack in force on 156 Para and 'D' Squadron GPR. At 07:42 the attack started and at 07:50, by now under intense pressure, Brigade headquarters called down artillery fire almost {{on top of their}} own positions which broke up the assault. Attacks continued all morning and a shortage of hand held anti-tank weapons allowed German tanks to safely approach the brigade's positions. The tanks targeted the houses <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> a room at a time, forcing the defenders out and into trenches dug in the gardens. Both units managed to hold out, however their situation was officially described as [...] "grim". The numbers of British casualties exhausted all available medical supplies and wound dressings. Those wounded who required urgent treatment were now directed to the Schoonoord Hotel, which was in German hands.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{eruption}} {{along the}} Great Rift and similar basaltic rift systems {{starts with a}} curtain of very fluid lava <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> to [...] high along {{a segment of the}} rift up to [...] long. As the eruption continues, pressure and heat decrease and the chemistry of the lava becomes slightly more silica rich. The curtain of lava responds by breaking apart into separate vents. Various types of volcanoes may form at these vents: gas-rich pulverized lava creates cinder cones (such as Inferno Cone– stop 4), and pasty lava blobs form spatter cones (such as Spatter Cones– stop 5). Later stages of an eruption push lava streams out through the side or base of cinder cones, which usually ends the life of the cinder cone (North Crater, Watchmen, and Sheep Trail Butte are notable exceptions). This will sometimes breach part of the cone and carry it away as large and craggy blocks of cinder (as seen at North Crater Flow– stop 2– and Devils Orchard– stop 3). Solid crust forms over lava streams and lava tubes (a type of cave), and are created when lava vacates its course (examples can be seen at the Cave Area– stop 7).|$|E
500|$|It {{was well}} known to British {{servicemen}} that spending three months or more missing behind enemy lines resulted in an automatic posting back home, which Smith did not want; he was therefore wary as he entered his interview at the Naples transit base. When passage back to Rhodesia via Egypt was offered, Smith successfully requested permission to go to Britain instead, {{saying that he had}} many relatives there and considered it a second home. In England he was posted to a six-week refresher course in Shropshire, flying Spitfires. Smith performed very strongly in the exercises and, at his own request, was posted back to active service after only three weeks in the course. He was attached to No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron, part of No. 125 Wing, which was commanded by Group Captain (later Air Vice Marshal) Johnnie Johnson, {{one of the most successful}} RAF flying aces of the war. Reporting for duty with No. 130 Squadron at Celle, in western Germany, on 23 April 1945, he flew combat missions there, [...] " [...] a little bit of fun <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> odd things", he recalled, until the European war ended on 7 May with Germany's surrender.|$|E

Returning to the start point, L'Estrange tried again, <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> into the air approximately [...] and sailing away towards the south, before descending again and being dragged across the park. The crowd feared the balloon would crash but once more it lifted, up and over the roof of Carters' Barracks. L'Estrange, realising that the balloon was not going to lift higher, threw out the anchor, which caught in the spouting of a building and threw the balloon into the drying yard of the Benevolent Asylum, where it caught in the washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed. Still, L'Estrange's place in Sydney hearts had been established and a well-attended benefit was held at the Theatre Royal on 19 December 1878.|$|E
500|$|Sierra {{found that}} Williams tended to garner {{extremely}} favorable press, even as Phantasmagoria got negative press, so {{the company began}} having her discuss the game in person. In response to the backlash, Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television, which she said often have more violent content than Phantasmagoria, in part because computer games are often regarded as children's entertainment rather than for adults. Williams said Phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like Doom and Mortal Kombat, and that unlike those games, Phantasmagoria is [...] "the good guy ... not going around <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> people". Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the company's vice president of sales, both expressed surprise at {{the reaction to the}} game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing, box warnings and censoring options. Cloutier said the company was essentially [...] "censoring ourselves". Steven L. Kent of The Seattle Times said there were more violent games than Phantasmagoria, but that most video game violence appears in computer animations, and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live-action game, which elicits a stronger emotional response.|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy.

You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and <b>shooting</b> <b>up</b> bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music".
