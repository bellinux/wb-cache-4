40|$|Purpose Applications {{of dynamic}} {{shimming}} require high field fidelity, and characterizing the shim field dynamics is therefore necessary. Modeling {{the system as}} linear and time-invariant, {{the purpose of this}} work was to measure the impulse response function with optimal sensitivity. Theory and Methods Frequency-swept pulses as inputs are analyzed theoretically, showing that the sweep speed is a key factor for the measurement sensitivity. By adjusting the sweep speed it is possible to achieve any prescribed noise profile in the measured system response. Impulse response functions were obtained for the third-order shim system of a 7 Tesla whole-body MR scanner. Measurements of the shim fields were done with a dynamic field camera, yielding also cross-term responses. Results The measured shim impulse response functions revealed system characteristics such as response bandwidth, eddy currents and specific resonances, possibly of mechanical origin. Field predictions based on the shim characterization were shown to agree well with directly measured fields, also in the cross-terms. Conclusion Frequency sweeps provide a flexible tool for shim or gradient system characterization.

40|$|In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, a <b>set</b> of <b>shim</b> coils are {{designed}} to generate specific magnetic fields, thus eliminating harmonic components of magnetic field to obtain a high level homogeneous magnetic field within the region of interesting (ROI). In the electromagnetic design process, {{in order to produce}} the desired magnetic field, the deviation between the calculated magnetic field of shim coil and the theoretical magnetic field is treated as a kind of traditional objective functions to optimize the distribution of current density on the surface of shim coil skeleton. However, such function is ill-posed because of the overdetermined or underdetermined system of equations. The regularization method is commonly used to solve such problem by constructing the regularization term. This article proposes a new iterative optimization method for the design of shim coils in MRI. Based on the boundary element method (BEM), the discretized stream functions can be obtained by discretizing the surface of coil skeleton using a set of triangular elements. As the regularization term, the second derivative stream function is included in the minimization of the deviation between calculated magnetic fields and target magnetic fields. The distribution of coil which meets the design requirements can be obtained by using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. At last, the cubic spline interpolation is used to make lines as smooth as possible to be processed.

MR technology is moving towards ultra-high field (UHF) 7 T and 9. 4 Tscanners which provide more signal intensity.

5000|$|The {{two most}} common forms of handgun are the {{revolver}} and the semi-automatic. The semi-auto contains {{a number of}} cartridges in a magazine, usually {{in the grip of}} the gun, which are fed one at a time into the chamber for firing. The revolver is an older type, familiar to most as the movie-cowboy's [...] "six-shooter." [...] Because the cylinder of a revolver (where the cartridges are held) must rotate freely, there is a slight gap between the front of the cylinder and the barrel. When a round is fired, the velocity of the bullet is determined by the amount of push it is given by the gunpowder in the cartridge as the bullet leaves the gun. For a long time people have wondered how much energy is lost because it escapes through the gap rather than pushing the bullet through the barrel. So in 2011 the BBTI team devised a way to test how that gap affects the velocity of the bullet. In this case they tested a wide variety of ammunition available in [...]38 and [...]357 magnum using a single revolver modified to have a long barrel (so that they could cut it down an inch at a time, as they did with the barrel length tests) and also modified to allow them to change the gap using a <b>set</b> of <b>shims.</b> In this way they were able to test with a fairly standard cylinder gap of six one-thousandths of an inch (0.006"), with a gap of one one-thousandth of an inch (0.001") and with no gap at all. Each of these gaps was tested over the range of ammunition at barrel lengths from 18" [...] down to 2". Because they thought the difference would be subtle, they shot ten rounds for each data point to get as accurate a result as possible. As with the barrel length tests, the results at each point were averaged and a graph created that compared the trend {{for each of the three}} gaps over the different barrel lengths for each ammunition.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new passive shim design method and a novel shimming procedure {{to correct the}} magnetic field inhomogeneities generated by C-shape permanent biplanar magnetic resonance imaging magnets. The method expresses the shim distribution as a sum of orthogonal functions multiplied by unknown amplitudes. The oscillating modes of the shim magnetization-thickness function are normalized within a finite disk. By minimizing the <b>shim</b> <b>set</b> weight and constraining the magnetization-thickness function, the method produces a continuous map of the required shim contribution. The map defines the shim shape and a discrete process then determines the regions where no shim contributions are needed. With this methodology, passive shims capable of generating magnetic field harmonics with minimal impurities and ferro-shim pieces can be generated. The paper reports a study of magnetic coupling among the iron pieces and its influence over the magnetic field harmonics of linear and nonlinear iron, and demonstrates that {{the exclusion of the}} magnetic coupling in the shimming process produces an unacceptable error in the final shimmed field homogeneity. The proper selection and arrangement of individual shim sizes produces a better conditioned field source matrix and hence improves the design.

40|$|Synopsis: This paper {{presents}} a new alternative shimming procedure {{to correct the}} magnetic field inhomogeneities generated by horizontal and C-shape biplanar MRI magnets. A magnetization map obtained {{through the application of}} the Equivalent Magnetizing Current (EMC) method is used to define the domain where the discrete iron <b>shim</b> <b>set</b> is placed to generate a given field harmonic [1]. Optionally, instead of iron a current pattern is used, then the magnetization is related to the stream function (SF) and the current pattern is placed at equally spaced contours of the SF [1]. If a set of discrete iron pieces with no reversible magnetization direction is employed to mimic the continuous magnetization function (MF) map, then iron shims of unit strength are placed only in the positive domain (valid domain) of the MF map. The field source matrix is calculated only for the discrete elements located in the valid domain, which leads to a better conditioned matrix and superior solutions. An LP algorithm is used to calculate the optimal thickness and location of the discrete ferroshims to produce the target harmonics. Examples of simulated shimming of horizontal/C-shape magnets are presented. In the case of permanent open magnets, the magnetic coupling among the iron pieces and its influence over the magnetic field harmonics is studied for linear and nonlinear iron cases. The influence of the selection and arrangement of individual shim sizes over the field source matrix conditioning is also analysed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically <b>set</b> using a <b>shim</b> under a cam follower.|$|R
40|$|A novel active {{shimming}} {{method is}} {{proposed for the}} correction of magnetic field nonuniformity of superconducting (SC) magnet for magnetic resonance imaging. Active shimming utilizes several coils to correct specific field harmonic components appear in the inhomogeneous field, and each coil is usually designed independently to the others, and also takes no account {{of the presence of}} the main magnet coil blocks. However, the magnetic coupling among these SC shim coils exists, and also the interaction between those zonal even-order shim coils and the main magnet are particularly significant. This coupling/interaction can lead to the drift of main field and even a possible destruction of shim coils by quench due to tremendous energy transferred from the main magnet. In this paper, we attempt to develop magnetic decoupling technologies for the reduction of magnetic interactions between the shim coil and main magnet. Specifically, a hybrid optimization algorithm, including linear and nonlinear programming, is proposed to design a set of decoupled even-order zonal shim coils. The linear programming determines the globally optimal topology and preliminary position of the shim coils. Then, the nonlinear programming is applied to further optimize the position and the turn number of the shim coils, ensuring the designed coils are capable of correcting the unwanted field deviation. Taking the example of Z 2 shim coil, compared with the conventional Z 2 shim coil, the proposed method significantly reduces the mutual inductance between the Z 2 shim coil and the main magnet. For the same field deviation in the tested case, the mutual inductance has been decreased from 83 to 2. 3 H. We also further analyze the influence of system parameters and main magnet structure on the optimal topology of decoupled Z 2 shim coil. Z 4 and Z 6 shim coils are also designed with excellent decoupling effect. In our future work, a whole <b>set</b> of active <b>shim</b> coils decoupled from each other and also the main magnet and will be designed and tested in the 9. 4 T whole-body MRI system...|$|R

Fields inside RFQ quadrants are measured by a fully automated bead-pull system. Tuning this 6 -meter long cold model is a comprehensive training in view of the future tuning of the copper RFQ with the variable voltage profile. THE IPHI COLD MODEL A 6 -meter aluminum cold model has been built to validate the tuning procedure of the IPHI RFQ. To tune it, several devices have to be adjusted at different steps of machining and assembling. The cold model can be divided in 2 -meter long segments with capacitive coupling in-between which can be <b>set</b> by additional <b>shims</b> (Figure 1). The tuning of the segment end regions is made by machining the thickness of the end and coupling plates, and by dipole rods length adjustments. Finally, irregular tuners distribution and RF inputs will be used to achieve the setting of the inter-vane voltage. Here, we will work with 24 slug tuners and 2 RF ports (used as slugs) per quadrant for the tuning procedure of the model (Figure 2). Moreover a fully automated test bench has been developed to measure the field distribution [1]. Based on the perturbation method, a bead is guided successively through 4 quadrants and field distribution of excited mode is obtained.

New design techniques are coupled with experimental construction methods to expand small animal insert gradient and shim technology. The design techniques are also applied {{to other areas of}} magnetic resonance hardware. A custom 2 -axis gradient insert coil is designed and fabricated for the purpose of eddy current characterization. The construction tolerances were examined via bench top inductance measurements and eddy currents measurement inside a 7. 0 T head-only MR system. A great deal of freedom is available when positioning shielding coils with respect to their corresponding primary coils in small animal inserts before eddy currents become prohibitive for imaging. A new method for actively shielding electromagnets is presented. The minimum energy method for designing shielding coils of any geometry is developed and validated against historical methods. Several shielded gradient insert coils are designed, including a cylindrical gradient set with rectangular shields, which demonstrates the versatility of this new method. The performance of the shielded insert coils is reported. A high power custom shim insert coil is designed and optimized for dynamic shimming applications. This 10 -axis shim insert coil is designed to operate at currents higher than any previously existing <b>shim</b> <b>sets.</b> Several experimental fabrication methods are tested during the construction of the insert coil. Inductance, resistance and cooling measurements are conducted and compared to design specifications. Field measurements are taken using a 3 -axis field transducer and the shim efficiencies are calculated.

Lastly, the minimum energy method for active shielding is applied to several MR fringe field type problems. Shields are designed to conform to rooms within an imaging facility for the purpose of controlling the magnetic footprint of an MR system.
