2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E

5000|$|Zero <b>speed</b> <b>switches</b> (ZSS) {{also known}} as <b>Speed</b> Actuating Sensing <b>Switches</b> are used to detect whether a {{rotating}} shaft is turning (even at very slow speeds) [...] in various machines, conveyors, power plants, and in industries involving the production of cement, sugar, textiles, paper, etc. Zero <b>speed</b> <b>switches</b> mainly use electromechanical, electronic, or magnetic proximity technologies. Electromechanical <b>speed</b> <b>switches</b> are direct coupled, speed-indicating devices which open or close a set of contacts mechanically, {{as a function of}} the rotational <b>speed</b> of the <b>switch</b> shaft. Electronic zero <b>speed</b> <b>switches</b> are direct-coupled, speed-indicating devices that open or close a set of contacts through a relay and electronic circuit. User-defined settings and the rotational input speed of the shaft determine the speed at which an electronic zero-speed switch trips.|$|R

5000|$|Clock <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> (“turbo” switch). Changed the {{processor}} clock speed {{from the standard}} 3 MHz (BK-0010* series) to 4 or 6 MHz, or from the standard 4 MHz (BK-0011* series) to 3 or 6 MHz. Not all processor samples worked reliably at 6 MHz; the possibility of such overclocking had to be determined experimentally for each sample. Switching the clock speed changed the pace of dynamic games. The turbo switch usually had to be installed together with the pause switch, because the simplest circuit for switching the clock speed produced bad shapes in the clock signal due to contact bounce when the mechanical switch was flipped, running the risk of hanging the software execution unless {{the processor}} was in the suspended state.|$|E
5000|$|The petrol-electric drive {{specially}} {{developed by}} Ferdinand Porsche entered [...] "uncharted territory". It was {{this reason that}} defects were produced in the drive system. The two air-cooled 10-cylinder engines designated Porsche 101/1, which were merged respectively with a Siemens-Schuckert 500 VA generator, generated the necessary electric energy to operate {{each of the two}} Siemens 230 kW (312.7 PS) output-apiece electric motors. In this drive system, a transmission system could be omitted, since now a 3-step <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> took over the work. The electric motors transferred their power with a drive ratio of 15: 1 directly to the drive wheels located at the rear. The tank carried 520 litres of petrol and allowed a driving range of 80 kilometers. Two compressed air tanks in the front crew compartment area supported the tank driver during braking maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|Bacterial type IV pili are {{essential}} for adhesion to surfaces, motility, microcolony formation, and horizontal gene transfer in many bacterial species. These polymers are strong molecular motors that can retract at two different speeds. In the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae <b>speed</b> <b>switching</b> of single pili from 2 µm/s to 1 µm/s can be triggered by oxygen depletion. Here, we address the question how proton motive force (PMF) influences motor speed. Using pHluorin expression in combination with dyes that are sensitive to transmembrane ΔpH gradient or transmembrane potential ΔΨ, we measured both components of the PMF at varying external pH. Depletion of PMF using uncouplers reversibly triggered switching into the low speed mode. Reduction of the PMF by ≈ 35 mV was enough to trigger <b>speed</b> <b>switching.</b> Reducing ATP levels by inhibition of the ATP synthase did not induce <b>speed</b> <b>switching.</b> Furthermore, we showed that the strictly aerobic Myxococcus xanthus failed to move upon depletion of PMF or oxygen, indicating that although the mechanical properties of the motor are conserved, its regulatory inputs have evolved differently. We conclude that depletion of PMF triggers <b>speed</b> <b>switching</b> of gonococcal pili. Although ATP is required for gonococcal pilus retraction, our data indicate that PMF is an independent additional energy source driving the high speed mode...|$|R

5000|$|The {{function}} of the spark gap is to initially present a high resistance to the circuit so that the C1 capacitor is allowed to charge. When the breakdown voltage of the gap is reached, {{the air in the}} gap ionizes, the resistance across the gap is dramatically lower and a current pulse flows across the arc {{to the rest of the}} circuit. The gap is set so that the discharge coincides with a maximum or near maximum of charge in C1 and it is as if a high <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> is turned on at just the right moment to allow the C1 capacitor to discharge its stored energy into the other circuit elements. This pulse of energy is rapidly exchanged back and forth between the C2 and L elements and takes the form of a damped oscillation at a radio frequency. The back and forth exchange of energy is in the form of an alternating current and voltage wave with much of the energy flowing out to the antenna.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Limiting the {{short-circuit}} current effectively {{is of great}} importance to keep the safe and steady running of the power system. A novel fault current limiter (FCL) {{on the basis of}} a high <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> and a triggered vacuum switch (TVS) is presented.

The TVS is used to discharge the precharged pulse capacitor so as to rapidly extinguish the arc in the high <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> and to realize the active transfer of the short-circuit current. A resistor is used to limit the short-circuit current. The parameters of the FCL for the 10 kV power system are designed and a FCL apparatus is fabricated.

40|$|A {{laser diode}} current driver has been {{developed}} for free space laser communications. The driver provides 300 mA peak modulation current and exhibits an optical risetime of less than 400 ps. The current and optical pulses are well behaved and show minimal ringing. The driver is well suited for QPPM modulation at data rates up to 440 Mbit/s. Much previous work has championed current steering circuits; in contrast, the present driver is a single-ended on/off switch. This results in twice the power efficiency as a current steering driver. The driver electrical efficiency for QPPM data is 34 percent.

Optical digital computers are still some years away; however a number of devices that can ultimately lead to real optical computers have already been manufactured. The most likely nearterm optical computer will really be a hybrid composed of traditional architectural design along with some portions that can perform some functional operations in optical mode. Here a design of mech-zehnder interferometer is shown which works as a switch. This switch can be used in designing the optical memories as well as in add-drop multiplexers.

The proposed FCL uses a high <b>speed</b> <b>switch</b> to put an inductor in series with a capacitor and make resonance condition between them. This structure can hold the peak of fault current in the constant value that is not possible in previously introduced series resonance type FCLs. In such conditions, if fault continues, power system will not be experience large short circuit currents. Using non-superconducting inductor instead of superconducting one, leads to low construction and maintenance costs in this structure. In addition, in normal operation, capacitor of this FCL {{can be used as a}} series compensator. Analytical analysis for the proposed series resonance type FCL is performed in detail.

It decouples the system into computational and I/O interconnections each allowing “any-to-any ” communications among processors and I/O devices unlike the shared model in bus architecture. The computational interconnection, a network of processing units (compute-nodes), is used for inter-processor communication in carrying out computation tasks, while the I/O interconnection manages the transfer of I/O requests between the compute-nodes and the I/O or storage media through some dedicated I/O processing units (I /O-nodes). Considering the special functions performed by the I/O nodes, their placement and reliability become important issues in improving the overall performance of the interconnection system.

The bridge was imaged using a SEM before and after the bridge release. Not much difference could be seen, prompting further investigation. There was a suspicious looking bump {{in the middle of the}} bridge that led us to believe that the TEOS sacrificial layer was buried underneath polysilicon. A cross-cut of the bridge was done where the bumps could be seen transversally. A highlight etch was done, confirming our suspicions that the mystery layer was TEOS. During processing we realized that the mask for the sacrificial TEOS layer was the inverse polarity of what was needed. The TEOS layer width was also designed too thin, which made the etching process remove too much and making further steps overlap. Recreating this layer with a wider sacrificial TEOS and the correct polarity successfully managed to get the bridge to release. Further work would involve completing the switch and electrical testing now that the bridge release has been proven...|$|E

These force-generating motors work {{in at least}} three distinct velocity modes—elongation, and retraction at two distinct speeds, high and low. Yet it is unclear which regulatory inputs control their speeds. Here, we addressed this question for the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Using a combination of image analysis and surface analytics, we simultaneously monitored the speed of twitching motility and the concentration of oxygen. While oxygen was detectable, bacteria moved in the high-speed mode (1. 5 μm/s). Upon full depletion of oxygen, gonococci simultaneously switched into the low-speed mode (0. 5 μm/s). <b>Speed</b> <b>switching</b> was complete within seconds, independent of transcription, and reversible upon oxygen restoration.
