50|$|Standard option models: (a) Assume {{that the}} risk {{characteristics}} of the underlying do not change {{over the life of}} the option, usually expressed via a constant volatility assumption.

Under ROV, however: (a) managements' actions actually change the risk characteristics of the project in question, and hence (b) the Required rate of return could differ depending on what state was realised, and a premium over risk free would be required, invalidating (technically) the risk neutrality assumption.|$|E

40|$|From the {{perspective}} {{of much of the}} literature dealing with Information Security Standards, the decision to adopt or follow such standards is mainly a technical decision subject to regulatory requirements. This paper explains why the decision to adopt an information security standard is one taken in a complex marketplace of competing standards, competing service providers, competing security design methods, and competing national and international legislative requirements, all under the oversight of closely watched audit firms and government regulators. While the dependence on standards for guidance in information security is growing, so is the complexity of the decision. The decision affects the economic justification of internal controls in information systems. Without regulatory <b>standards,</b> <b>risk</b> economics are necessary to justify acquisition and implementation of controls. With regulatory <b>standards,</b> <b>risk</b> economics are necessary to justify exceptions to the acquisition and implementation of controls. The impact of this economic shift may drive down organizational competitiveness or increase misleading compliance behaviour among IT professionals...|$|R

50|$|Each {{player is}} {{allocated}} 3 energy chips {{before the game}} begins. The number of armies allocated to each player {{and the process of}} claiming territories is identical to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Risk</b> board game, but the armies are called MODs; therefore, number of MODs allocated to each player {{at the beginning of the}} game depends on the number of players. If three people are playing, each player counts out 35 MODs; four players, 30 MODs; five players, 25 MODs. Players then take turns claiming land territories by placing a 1.0 MOD on an unoccupied land territory until all the land territories are occupied. Players then take turns placing their remaining armies on their claimed land territories. Following MOD placement, each player places a space station, a land commander, and a diplomat on any of their claimed territories.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Team Risk", {{the teams}} work {{together}} and either win or lose as a team. This is the version that can end {{in the very first}} turn and it receives much criticism for that fact (setup can take up to an hour with first-time players and then the game could end in 5 minutes). Fans of the Lord of the Rings franchise who are less interested in the mechanics of <b>Standard</b> <b>Risk</b> will likely enjoy this version the most because it more closely resembles the strategies of the forces of Middle Earth. In this version, the Fellowship path is the most important factor and must be cherished by both good and evil as their main priorities. At the end of each turn, if the Ring is in a territory controlled by evil, {{they have a chance to}} find the ring and win the game; roll two dice, add 1 if there's a leader in the same territory, add 1 if evil controls the entire region, if there's a leader and evil owns the entire region add 2 (the rules are ambiguous about whether this is intended to allow a max bonus of 2 or 4), if the total including bonuses equals or exceeds 12, the One Ring is found and evil wins. As the Ring progresses closer to Mount Doom, the regions where the Ring has been are no longer as important and the regions where it will be (especially Mordor) will become the most important areas of the game. Points do not matter in this version, only total destruction of the enemy or the fate of the One Ring will determine the winner of [...] "Team Risk".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> aversion. A von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function has <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> aversion if any risk makes a small reduction in wealth more painful (in the sense of an increased reduction in expected utility) also makes any undesirable, independent risk more painful. It is shown that, given monotonicity and concavity, the combination of decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing absolute prudence is necessary and sufficient for <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> aversion. <b>Standard</b> <b>risk</b> aversion is shown to imply not only Pratt and Zeckhauser's 'proper risk aversion" (individually undesirable, independent risks always being jointly undesirable), but also that being forced to face an undesirable risk reduces the optimal investment in a risky security with and independent return. Similar results are established for the effect of broad class of increases in one risk on the desirability of (or optimal investment in) a second, independent risk. ...|$|E

Organ {{irradiation}} and combination chemotherapy {{in treatment}} of {{acute lymphocytic leukaemia}} in children. A total of 30 consecutive children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) were treated from June 1971 until December 1974. Remission was induced {{with the use of}} vincristine and prednisone. After induction of remission, cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate were given. Then the liver, spleen, and kidney were irradiated and 6 -mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate were administered during the maintenance phase. Pulsed doses of vincristine and prednisone were administered at 10 - to 12 -week intervals. The patients were subdivided into two groups based on their initial white blood cell (WBC) counts: a <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> group with an initial WBC count of less than 25 000 /mm 3 (25 X 10 (9) / 1) and a high risk group with an initial WBC count greater than 25 000 /mm 3 (25 X 10 (9) / 1). Of the 30 children entered in this study one <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> patient died in the induction phase before attaining remission. Analysis of the results is therefore based on the remaining 29 patients, 22 <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> and 7 high risk patients, who attained complete remission.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} self-rated health, adjusted for <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> factors, and myocardial infarction. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Setting: Enrolment took place between 1990 and 2004 in Västerbotten County, Sweden Participants: Every year, persons in the total population, aged 40, 50 or 60 were invited. Participation rate was 60 %. The cohort consisted of 75 386 men and women. After exclusion for stroke or myocardial infarction before, or within 12 months after enrolment or death within 12 months after enrolment, 72 530 persons remained for analysis. Mean follow-up time was 13. 2 years. Outcome measures: Cox regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate HRs for the end point of first non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction. HR were adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, body mass index, education, physical activity and self-rated health in the categories very good; pretty good; somewhat good; pretty poor or poor. Results: In the cohort, 2062 persons were diagnosed with fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Poor selfrated health adjusted for sex and age was associated with the outcome with HR 2. 03 (95 % CI 1. 45 to 2. 84). All categories of self-rated health worse than very good were statistically significant and showed a dose–response relationship. In a multivariable analysis with <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> factors (not including physical activity and education) HR was attenuated to 1. 61 (95 % CI 1. 13 to 2. 31) for poor self-rated health. All categories of self-rated health remained statistically significant. We found no interaction between self-rated health and <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> factors except for poor self-rated health and diabetes. Conclusions: This study supports the use of self-rated health as a <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> factor among others for myocardial infarction. It remains to demonstrate whether self-rated health adds predictive value for myocardial infarction in combined algorithms with <b>standard</b> <b>risk</b> factors...|$|E
40|$|An IT risk {{assessment}} must deliver {{the best possible}} quality of results in a time-effective way.

The QualTD Model is based on our previous quantitative model, but geared to industrial practice since it does not require quantitative data which is often too costly to acquire. We validate the model and method in a real-world case by performing a {{risk assessment}} on the authentication and authorisation system of a large multinational company and by evaluating the results w. r. t. the goals of the stakeholders of the system.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{regulation}} of environmental risks in a heterogeneous industry when policy makers are sensitive to uncertainties about the processes generating the risks. Optimal source reduction capacity is shown to vary according to site suitability. Optimal source reduction capacity and the implicit value of risk reduction increase as <b>risk</b> <b>standards</b> become more stringent and as aversion to uncertainty grows. Taxes are more equitable than standards whenever the emissions generating the risks are all-or-nothing.

Aversion to uncertainty influences investment in pollution control substantially.
