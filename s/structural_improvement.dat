5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this <b>structural</b> <b>improvement,</b> combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E
25|$|Ordered as a {{follow-on}} to the NA-57 as a two-seat advanced trainer, the NA-64 P-2/NAA-64 P-2 {{represented a}} major <b>structural</b> <b>improvement,</b> with a longer all-metal fuselage replacing the fabric covered fuselage of the NA-57. As well as metal skin replacing the fabric on the fuselage, the fin was changed {{from having a}} corrugated skin to being a smooth stressed skin structure and was moved slightly aft, lengthening the rear fuselage while the engine was moved forward to maintain the center of gravity. The rudder was also changed from the rounded shape used previously to one with a roughly triangular shape with the broadest part being at the bottom to improve handling at high angles of attack.

5000|$|Ana {{continued}} to track westwards {{away from the}} Hawaiian islands, until it reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge and as a cold front began to extend towards it. At this point, Ana had weakened to a minimal tropical storm. As it turned northeast, warm sea surface temperatures caused Ana to rapidly re-organise and strengthen, and by 03:00 UTC on October 25 it became a hurricane again, with a cloud-filled eye developing with <b>structural</b> <b>improvement.</b> As it accelerated northeast at speeds of 40 mph, Ana succumbed to the wind shear and weakened again to a tropical storm. Shortly afterwards, Ana transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC on October 26.

5000|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{crossed the}} west coast of Africa between August 15 and August 16. Later that day and early on August 17, the system began developing more convection, while located just west of Sierra Leone. As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in the Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs). Thereafter, further organization briefly halted, though by early on August 18, associated convection became more concentrated. On the following day, the wave reached a [...] "high" [...] probability of tropical cyclogenesis. Between early on August 19 and early on August 21, minimal <b>structural</b> <b>improvement</b> occurred, despite increases in development probability. By August 21, the system developed enough organization for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Nine; at the time, the depression was located about 715 mi (1150 km) east of the Leeward Islands, moving westward to the south of a large ridge. Conditions were generally favorable for further intensification, with the exception of northeasterly wind shear.|$|E

50|$|A {{substantially}} larger secondary eye, {{estimated to}} be 315 km (195 mi) wide, began forming shortly after Soulik attained its peak on July 10. By this time, the deep convection was no longer symmetrical around the storm and was mostly located over the southern and eastern areas of the circulation. This formation of a secondary eye indicated an eyewall replacement cycle was in progress; however, it coincided with the typhoon passing over a small area of very low oceanic heat content and prompted a weakening trend. Convection around Soulik's core gradually weakened, though it retained a well-defined inner eye. The simultaneous occurrence of these two factors greatly hindered reorganization {{of the system and}} the weakening trend continued as the typhoon tracked west-northwest toward Taiwan. On July 11, this trend temporarily abated as Soulik moved over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current, allowing for <b>structural</b> <b>improvement.</b> Early on July 12, dry air began to entrain into the northwestern portion of the circulation, suppressing thunderstorm development. Along the southeastern side of the storm, a large band of convection maintained itself and wrapped around a poorly defined eye.|$|E

Options included swiveling Strato-bucket seats (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. While lesser Chevelles (except the Malibu SS option) came standard with either a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder or 307-cubic-inch two-barrel V8, Lagunas came standard with a 145-horsepower 350-cubic-inch two-barrel V8. Options included a 350 4-barrel V8 of [...] and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at [...] Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. Three-speed manual transmission was standard; four-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.|$|E

Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger [...] fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.
