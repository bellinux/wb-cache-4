5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type <b>species,</b> <b>is</b> known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller <b>species,</b> <b>is</b> known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The <b>species</b> <b>is</b> popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The <b>species</b> <b>is</b> hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The <b>species</b> <b>is</b> relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>species</b> <b>is</b> endemic, the <b>species</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} not threatened, but in Western Australia, the twenty-eight subspecies (B. z. semitorquatus) gets locally {{displaced by}} the introduced rainbow lorikeets that aggressively compete for nesting places. The rainbow lorikeet is considered a pest species in Western Australia and is subject to eradication in the wild.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{diversity}} and structure of bird communities is essential to delineate the importance of regional or local landscapes for avian conservation. Birds {{are very sensitive to}} environmental changes and are used as a “bioindicator. ” The study was carried out to explore {{the diversity}} and status of avifauna in the Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India, from January 2013 to December 2013. The line transect method was used to cover most of the study area. A total of 142 species of birds belonging to 45 families and 18 orders were recorded. Muscicapidae was the most dominant family with 23 species, and its relative diversity index was also found to be the highest (relative diversity index =  16. 19). The analysis of data on residential status revealed that 99 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> residents, six <b>species</b> <b>were</b> winter visitors, three <b>species</b> <b>were</b> summer visitors, and 14 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> passage visitors. The analysis of feeding habits showed that a maximum number of <b>species</b> (44 <b>species)</b> <b>were</b> omnivorous, 42 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> insectivorous, 35 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> carnivorous, 12 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> granivorous, four <b>species</b> <b>were</b> frugivorous, four <b>species</b> <b>were</b> insectivorous–nectivorous, and one <b>species</b> <b>was</b> nectivorous. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, 128 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Least Concern category, one <b>species</b> <b>was</b> in the Endangered category, two <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Critically Endangered category, six <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Near Threatened category, and two <b>species</b> <b>were</b> in the Vulnerable category. Thus, the Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary supports a sound avifaunal diversity. Its proper management will not only improve the situation for its resident species, but will also attract more migratory and vagrant species in the future...|$|R

40|$|It is an {{important}} task in biodiversity conservation to assess species endangerment status and determine protection priorities. Although IUCN Redlist Criteria are improving through periodical revision, people are still developing different criteria because information about population census, habitat status and life history of a given <b>species</b> <b>are</b> often lacking. We reviewed the progress of assessing species endangerment status, both internationally and domestically, and propose that future designations combine distribution area, life history, ecological function, anthropogenic interference and special use data to more accurately assess endangerment status. As an example, we assessed the status of terrestrial vertebrates in China using thismethod. Our results showed that five <b>species</b> <b>were</b> listed {{in the category of}} extinct, 30 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> extinct, 343 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> endangered, 459 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> threatened, 439 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> concerned, and 1, 032 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> least concerned...|$|R
