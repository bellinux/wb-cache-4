5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted to <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} {{an exit strategy}} of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E

After a year in court, their divorce was made final on March 29, 1978. In the divorce, she completely parted ways with him, retaining only her stage name and assuming responsibility for the debts incurred by the canceled tour as well as a significant Internal Revenue Service lien.|$|E

The team had in its ranks a number of prominent players, but the game ended in a tie, and the return game on 17 October went 1–0 for the young Bernese club. Some of the Young Boys appeared increasingly in the FC Bern first team, affecting the incumbent Bern players. On 30 December 1898, the Young Boys held an election to either combine with FC Bern or <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own.

25|$|Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, {{his fortune}} upon {{his death was}} worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the {{transition}} to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as ministro. Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive {{his share of the}} patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only a generation or two because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, and it seems to have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.|$|E

500|$|Diệm {{contended that}} the Communists would never allow free {{elections}} in the north, so therefore South Vietnam must <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> its own and establish a separate, non-Communist state. This was echoed by the Saigon press, which ran articles assailing communist elections as shambolic, rigged, and meaningless; at the time, the northern half of Vietnam had a greater population than the south. A month earlier, North Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng wrote to Saigon asking to begin negotiations over the specific details of the elections. While the Americans were happy to avoid elections because of fears of a communist victory, they hoped that Diệm would enter the dialogue over planning matters and wait for North Vietnam to object to a proposal, and thus use it to blame Ho [...] for violating the Geneva Accords. The Americans had earlier advised Diệm, who had been acting in defiance of Bảo Đại, that continued aid was contingent on Diệm establishing a legal basis for usurping the head of state's power.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard held strong {{opinions}} about many {{leaders of the}} civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a [...] "great black leader" [...] and integrationist Martin Luther King to be favored by whites because he [...] "was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution." [...] Rothbard praised Malcolm X for [...] "acting white" [...] through use of his intellect and wit, and contrasted him favorably with the [...] "fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, [...] "Dr." [...] King". But while he compared Malcolm X's black nationalism favorably to King's integrationism, and for a time praised black nationalism, in 1993 he rejected the vision of a [...] "separate black nation", asking [...] "does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> its own, with no massive [...] "foreign aid" [...] from the U.S.A.?"

500|$|Meanwhile, back on Earth, {{with their}} members running low on energon and slowly being {{captured}} by Skywatch, tension is high amongst the Autobots. After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force information out of Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of Blurr and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is stopped by Hot Rod. He also fails in trying to get Hot Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|E
