40|$|The Al-Mg alloy sheets {{containing}} 6. 8 wt. % Mg {{were tested}} under different stretching conditions (uniaxial, plain-strain and balanced biaxial) {{in order to}} make some surface roughness created by type "A " or type "B " surface markings appearance. The presented results indicate that the <b>stretcher-strain</b> surface appearance was influenced in a great deal by changing the stress state, i. e. the stretching strain path. The harmful <b>stretcher-strain</b> lines appearance is mostly related to dynamic strain aging (DSA) and it can be suppressed in equibiaxial stretching conditions...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{suitable}} for automotive application were reviewed briefly {{as well as}} the reasons for the future wider application of Al-Mg type alloys. Basic problems related to the limited consumption of Al-Mg type alloy sheets in automotive applications as the appearance of <b>stretcher-strain</b> markings and paint baking- induced softening considered. Also, the current knowledge on the promising approaches to overcome those problems was estimated...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of light}} metals and high strength steel in the automobile industry, demands for new sheet metal forming processes {{that can be applied}} successfully. In this thesis the subject of warm sheet metal forming is studied. In warm sheet metal forming the temperature of the blank is elevated either globally to one temperature evenly over the blank or locally where the flange region of the blank is given a higher temperature. A survey of existing knowledge on the subject shows that the formability can be improved remarkably. This is especially true for the deep drawing of aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys. Other benefits can also be found like the elimination of <b>stretcher-strain</b> marks, which can be found on certain aluminium alloys, and reduction of springback. The temperature of the blank is usually elevated by using heated tools that warm the blank through conduction. The tools are usually heated by utilizing electrical resistance heaters inserted at different locations into the tool. If the flange region is to be given a higher temperature the use of a heated blank holder and die can be used in conjunction with a cooled punch. In the thesis a new heating process is described called Localized In-Tool Induction Heating. The process integrates induction heating into the forming tool {{in such a way that}} a locally heated blank can be obtained. A short pre-heating time can then be followed by continual heating during the stroke. Since the blank is warmed, without heating the different parts of the tool, a fast and efficient process can be expected. A case study has been conducted where the manufacturing performance of Warm Sheet Metal Forming with Localized In-Tool Induction Heating has been compared with traditional sheet metal forming of a car trunk lid in aluminium. In the thesis it is concluded that warm sheet metal forming has a great potential, but the processes used must be further developed to meet production demands. A new process has been introduced and future research will further develop the process...|$|E
