5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> and one low-bismuth <b>solder</b> only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{crystalline}} silicon modules, the <b>solder</b> material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of lead (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb {{have been used for}} 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the <b>solder</b> alloy.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's <b>solder</b> consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little <b>solder</b> or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although <b>solder</b> with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{automatic}} <b>soldering</b> technology using {{industrial robots}} has been spreaded {{in the production}} line. As the main problem is this automation technique low production speed and low flexibility can be counted. Though development of new method in robotic <b>soldering</b> the production speed can be essentially improved rather than through optimization of <b>soldering</b> process and robot path. This paper introduces new <b>soldering</b> process suitable to robotics <b>soldering</b> and verifies the results through experiments. Optimized vibration process is added during wire feeding. By this method quality as well as <b>soldering</b> speed could be improved. Automatic <b>soldering</b> tool for robots imitated the motion of manual workers. But hte flexiblity of tool construction is very limited as against human hands. This poor flexibility of <b>soldering</b> tool cannot cover the wide application. Here a flexible <b>soldering</b> tool is introduced. In approaching of <b>soldering</b> tip to pin/pad will be searched correct positions of pin using optical fiber sensor in a cartesian direction. During press process 2 press-down force components will be feedbached to optimal value because the press-down force is a important parameter of <b>soldering</b> process...|$|R
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the <b>solder</b> in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, <b>solder</b> containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E
5|$|All 29 {{items of}} gold {{jewellery}} were analysed, with silver and copper {{found to be}} present. Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, {{in terms of the}} presence of copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements.

5|$|In PVC, cadmium {{was used}} as heat, light, and {{weathering}} stabilizers. Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of <b>solder</b> and bearing alloys, because a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It {{is also found in}} some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal.|$|E
25|$|Tin-based <b>solders</b> readily {{dissolve}} gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys {{the critical}} concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich <b>solders</b> (usually indium-lead) are {{more suitable for}} <b>soldering</b> thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate of gold in indium is much slower. Tin-rich <b>solders</b> also readily dissolve silver; for <b>soldering</b> silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their wettability is poorer. If the <b>soldering</b> time is long enough to form the intermetallics, the tin surface of a joint <b>soldered</b> to gold is very dull.|$|R
25|$|<b>Soldered</b> tone holes: Tone-holes may {{be either}} drawn (by pulling the tube {{material}} outwards) or <b>soldered</b> (cutting {{a hole in}} the tube and <b>soldering</b> an extra ring of material on). <b>Soldered</b> tone-holes are thought by some to improve tone, but generally cost more.|$|R

5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out.

2500|$|Two {{types of}} glass <b>solders</b> are used: vitreous, and devitrifying. Vitreous <b>solders</b> retain their {{amorphous}} structure during remelting, can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. Devitrifying <b>solders</b> undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a glass-ceramic, {{a composite of}} glassy and crystalline phases. Devitrifying <b>solders</b> usually create a stronger mechanical bond, but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal {{is more likely to}} be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque. Devitrifying <b>solders</b> are frequently [...] "thermosetting", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows <b>soldering</b> the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent bake-out without remelting the joint afterwards. Devitrifying <b>solders</b> frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide. In production of cathode ray tubes, devitrifying <b>solders</b> based on PbO-B2O3-ZnO are used.|$|R
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the <b>solder</b> was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in <b>solder</b> for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium <b>solder,</b> and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E

50|$|A <b>soldering</b> station, {{invariably}} temperature-controlled, {{consists of}} an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a <b>soldering</b> iron or <b>soldering</b> head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for <b>soldering</b> electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and a <b>soldering</b> head; a desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and a <b>soldering</b> iron head.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Power {{electronics}} {{are usually}} <b>soldered</b> to Al 2 -O 3 direct-bond-copper (DBC) substrates to increase thermal diffusivity, {{while at the}} same time increasing electrical isolation. However, <b>soldering</b> gives rise to inherent residual stresses and out-of-plane deformation. The purpose of this paper is to look at the effect of <b>soldering</b> processes of Al 2 -O 3 DBC substrates to copper plates and power electronics, on their thermal fatigue life and warpage. Design/methodology/approach – A numerical thermo-mechanical finite element model, using the Chaboche material model, was developed to identify the thermal plastic strains evolved during <b>soldering</b> of DBC substrates to copper plates and power electronics. The plastic strains in conjunction with established extremely low cycle fatigue life prediction model for ductile material were used to predict the number of <b>soldering</b> cycles to failure. The predicted out-of-plane deformation and number of <b>soldering</b> cycles to failures was compared to realistic tests. Findings – <b>Soldering</b> processes drastically reduce the thermal fatigue life of DBC substrates, giving rise to thermal cracking and premature failure. In this study the <b>soldering</b> process considered gave rise to out-of-plane deformations, consequently reducing heat dispersion in <b>soldered</b> DBC substrate assemblies. Furthermore, <b>soldering</b> gave rise to interface cracking and failed after three <b>soldering</b> cycles. Numerical finite element models were developed and are in good agreement with the experimental tests results. Research limitations/implications – The influence of <b>soldering</b> processes of DBC substrates to copper plates and electronics on the thermal fatigue life should be taken into consideration when establishing the design life of DBC substrates. Finite element models can be utilised to optimize <b>soldering</b> processes and optimize the design of DBC substrates...|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead <b>solder</b> used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to <b>solder</b> the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.'

Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead <b>solder.</b> Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{recombination}} {{induced by}} <b>soldering</b> pads, screen printed with a commercially available paste containing primarily silver and an aluminium amount of 1 - 5 %wt, is investigated concerning the open-circuit voltage for aluminium back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells. The saturation current density Jo,pad due to <b>soldering</b> pads {{is found to}} be in the range of 26. 7 103 to 85. 4 103 fA/cm 2 for different conditions of the rear silicon surface. The recombination under <b>soldering</b> pads leads to a voltage drop of ΔVoc = 6. 7 mV for Al-BSF solar cells with 6. 2 % of the rear side being covered with <b>soldering</b> pads compared to a cell with full-area Al-BSF. Within a microstructural analysis of the interface between the silicon surface and the <b>soldering</b> pads it is found that Al-alloying from the Al share in the <b>soldering</b> pad paste only occurs insularly. Furthermore, Al-BSF cells with and without residual rear side emitter and varying area fraction of <b>soldering</b> pads, using a <b>soldering</b> pad paste with and without an Al-share, are investigated. It is found that the non-overcompensated emitter regions under the <b>soldering</b> pads of Al-BSF solar cells affect cell performance dramatically in case of full area <b>soldering</b> pad, especially for an Al-free pad paste...|$|R
