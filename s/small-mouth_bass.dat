50|$|Thompson Pond offers good {{fishing for}} many warm water fish. A survey {{conducted}} in 1994 showed thirteen species including Large and <b>Small-mouth</b> <b>Bass,</b> Chain Pickerel, Yellow Perch, White Perch, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Sucker.|$|E
50|$|A {{survey in}} 1928 showed {{the lake was}} habitat for only ten {{remaining}} species. After clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers found a total of 54 species of fish captured in the lake between 1990 and 1999. The quality of sport fishing for large and <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> has gained national acclaim.|$|E
50|$|Fish include brook, grey, brown, and rainbow trout, {{landlocked}} atlantic salmon, pike, <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass,</b> and mullet. A {{number of}} rare animal species, including the endangered wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), {{have been documented}} within the wetlands of the Tomifobia valley, the Appalachian Corridor Appalachien (ACA). Avians in the area include bald eagles.|$|E

50|$|The Umpqua River boasts {{some of the}} world's best fly-fishing, salmon fishing, and {{sturgeon}} fishing. Umpqua river {{fishing is}} also famous for its <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass,</b> striped bass, and shad population. There are several campgrounds and RV parks on the Umpqua River, some of which offer riverfront RV camping, boat ramps, fish cleaning stations, and hot showers for guests to use.|$|E
50|$|Built on marshy ground, {{for much}} of its history Reedsport has {{struggled}} with frequent flooding; most of its early buildings were elevated 3 to 8 ft above ground. After a devastating flood in 1964, a dike was constructed to protect the lower town. During this flood, the waters reached the fish hatchery and overflowed the fish troughs allowing {{hundreds of thousands of}} smallmouth bass to be introduced into the Umpqua River. According to fishing reports <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> became the most abundant fish in the river. Every few years, high water induces city employees to close the dikes to prevent low-lying areas of the city from flooding.|$|E
40|$|Northern pike, Esox lucius, is a nonnative species {{introduced}} into the Yampa River system in the early 1980 s. They have established a reproducing population in the upper Yampa River and expanded their number and range within the Yampa and Green rivers. Pike are voracious predators and are considered a threat as competitors and predators to endangered and other native or game fishes in the Yampa River. This project implements nonnative-fish management actions described in the Colorado Division of Wildlife Aquatic Wildlife Management Plan for the Yampa River Basin (CDOW 1998). Management activities in the Yampa Aquatic Plan recommend active trapping and translocation of northern pike, <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass,</b> channel catfish, and white sucker. Previous sampling in 1999, resulted in the capture of 164 northern pike in both the Spawning Area near Hayden, Colorado and from backwaters in the Critical Habitat Reach, downstream of Craig, Colorado and the translocation of 80 northern pike to Yampa State Wildlife Area ponds. In 2000, 475 northern pike were captured in Critical Habitat and 350 moved to Rio Blanco Reservoir. In 2001, we focused on capturing northern pike that occupy critical habitat for Colorado pikeminnow which is downstream of Craig, Colorado and captured 268 northern pike during four sampling trips and transported them to Rio Blanco Reservoir. Sampling in Critical Habitat and translocation to Rio Blanco is planned again i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. â€”Although {{regulations}} {{prohibiting the}} use of natural baits are relatively common, new regulations specifically targeting {{the use of}} chemical attractants have recently been implemented. While no citeable evidence for these new regulations exists, {{they may have been}} promulgated due to a perceived increase in the risk of fish mortality from scented lures compared with un-scented lures. The present study investigated the hook-ing injury and short-term mortality of 238 adult <b>small-mouth</b> <b>bass</b> Micropterus dolomieu captured on Lake Erie by both experienced (fished. 100 d/year) and novice (fished, 10 d/year) anglers on actively fished jigs sim-ilarly threaded with minnows, nonscented plastic grubs, or grubs scented with chemical attractants. The depth of hook ingestion, the anatomical hooking location, the presence of bleeding at the hook wound, and the total amount of time taken to remove the hook were noted on all captured fish. The fish were then transferred to a retention cage, and their survival was monitored for 72 h before release. None of the fish captured suffered any immediate (, 1 h) or short-term (, 72 h) mortality. The type of bait used to capture the fish had no significant effect on the depth of hook penetration or the anatomical hooking location. More experienced anglers, however, hooked the fish significantly deeper in the mouth than the novice anglers. These results suggest that the use of the chemical attractants tested in the present study do not deleteriously affect the injury rates or survival of captured smallmouth bass. Therefore, regulations pro-hibiting the use of chemical attractants on actively fished single-hook jigs for smallmouth bass appear unjustified if the intent was to reduce hooking injury and mortality. Due to increasing recreational and competitive fishing pressures, the quality of black bass fisheries Micropterus spp., as measured by larger catches or better catch rates, is dependent on the effec-tiveness of catch-and-release management strate...|$|E
