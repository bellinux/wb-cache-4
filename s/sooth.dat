This preface is indeed a very conceited performance and the poem though in some passages of first-rate excellence is on the whole of very inferior execution." [...] Charles Lamb, in a 10 June 1796 letter to Coleridge, stated, [...] "With Joan of Arc I have been delighted, amazed. I had not presumed to expect of any thing of such excellence from Southey. why the poem is alone sufficient to redeem {{the character of the}} age we live in from the imputation of degenerating in Poetry [...] The subject is well chosen. It opens well [...] On the whole, I expect Southey one day to rival Milton." [...] Coleridge, in a 31 December 1796 letter to John Thelwall, admitted, [...] "I entirely according with your opinion of Southey's Joan [...] the poem tho' it frequently reached the sentimental, does not display, the poetical, Sublime. In language at once natural, perspicuous, & dignified, in manly pathos, in <b>sooth</b> & sonnet-like description, and above all, in character, & dramatic dialogue, Southey is unrivalled; but as certainly he does not possess opulence of Imagination, lofty-paced Harmony, or that toil of thinking, which is necessary in order to plan a Whole." ...|$|E

40|$|A <b>soother</b> (also {{known as}} pacifier, dummy, or binky) is a device used by small {{children}} for nonnutritive sucking needs {{as well as}} to fall asleep at night. However, children often drop their <b>soother</b> without being able to retrieve it in the dark causing them to cry and alert their parents. This often means that parents are forced to {{go out of their way}} in order to assist the crying child. This can occur several times a night and is inconvenient for parents especially when trying to sleep. This project explores different solutions to this problem and focuses on the development of a prototype of the best solution found. The solution is meant to allow children to assist themselves in retrieving their <b>soother.</b> The development is based on the integration of built-in electronics into the <b>soother</b> that are used to detect when the child is crying. Upon detection of the crying sound the device responds by lighting up for a given period of time allowing the child to see and retrieve the <b>soother.</b> This innovation is primarily intended to benefit parents with small children, improving the quality of their leisure time and sleep...|$|R
