5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E

While reminiscing about her experiences there, she said she was motivated by the drive and passion of the younger students. She also said <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> school's atmosphere. Savage spoke briefly on the challenges musicians face during their transition from backup to lead, and said that artists face more scrutiny when their performances are mediocre. Her business background has helped her fully understand the scope of the Nigerian music industry. Savage spoke about her business background and said that her level of professionalism does not make her susceptible to deception.|$|E
25|$|Isabella II succeeded {{her father}} {{when he died in}} 1833. She was only three years old and Maria Cristina, her mother, served as regent. Maria knew that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> support of the liberals to oppose Don Carlos so she granted a {{constitution}} in 1834. Don Carlos found his greatest support in Catalonia and the Basques country because the constitution centralized the provinces thus denying them the autonomy they sought. He was defeated and fled the country in 1839. Isabella was declared of age in 1843 and she married her cousin Francisco de Asis, the son of her father's brother, on 10 October 1846. A military revolution broke out against Isabella in 1868 and she was deposed on 29 September. She abdicated in favor of her son, Alfonso, in 1870, but Spain was proclaimed a republic for a brief time.|$|E

500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, her {{research}} with the abnormal population went into full swing, and she founded the Sanctuary Network. To get the funding <b>she</b> <b>needed,</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister reunited the Five to stop and kill Adam Worth (Ian Tracey), who was turned down as a sixth member and blamed the Five for the death of his daughter, from releasing a toxin in London. In the season two episode [...] "Next Tuesday", Magnus states she was a passenger on the RMS Titanic in 1912. In July 1944, she worked with the French Resistance in Normandy to prevent the Nazis from controlling a fire elemental before D-Day. She then charged the head Sanctuary in Old City, a fictional city in the Pacific Northwest, during which she decided to use the embryo to bear her daughter, Ashley (Emilie Ullerup). On one of her expeditions, she saved a young Will Zimmerman from a dangerous abnormal, but failed to capture it before it killed his mother.|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} 11, Kylie {{appeared}} in small roles in soap operas including The Sullivans and Skyways. In 1985, she was cast {{in one of the}} lead roles in The Henderson Kids. Minogue took time off school to film The Henderson Kids and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> independence to make it into the entertainment industry. During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue [...] "fragile" [...] after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be [...] "written off". In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing [...] "turned out to be the best thing for her". Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music program Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20million British viewers. Minogue became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one year and was the youngest recipient of the [...] "Gold Logie" [...] as the country's [...] "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.|$|E
2500|$|As Bankhead {{recorded}} in her memoirs, {{she took the}} show because <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> money but nearly changed her mind when she feared she'd {{be little more than}} a glorified mistress of ceremonies with nothing to do but introduce the feature performers. [...] "Guess what happened?" [...] she continued. [...] "Your heroine emerged from the fracas as the Queen of the Kilocycles. Authorities cried out that Tallulah had redeemed radio. In shepherding my charges through The Big Show, said the critics, I had snatched radio out of the grave. The autopsy was delayed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Day {{hated the}} idea of {{performing}} on television, but felt obliged to it. The first episode of The Doris Day Show aired on September 24, 1968, and, from 1968 to 1973, employed [...] "Que Sera, Sera" [...] as its theme song. Day grudgingly persevered (<b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> work to help pay off her debts), but only after CBS ceded creative control to her and her son. The successful show enjoyed a five-year run, and functioned as a curtain raiser for the popular Carol Burnett Show. It is remembered today for its abrupt season-to-season changes in casting and premise.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2000, Lewinsky began {{appearing}} in television commercials for the diet company Jenny Craig, Inc. The $1 million endorsement deal, which required Lewinsky to lose 40 or more pounds in six months, gained considerable publicity at the time. Lewinsky said that despite her desire {{to return to a}} more private life, <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> money to pay off legal fees, and she believed in the product. A Jenny Craig spokesperson said of Lewinsky, [...] "She represents a busy active woman of today with a hectic lifestyle. And she has had weight issues and weight struggles for a long time. That represents a lot of women in America." [...] The choice of Lewinsky as a role model proved controversial for Jenny Craig, and some of its private franchises switched to an older advertising campaign. The company stopped running the Lewinsky ads in February 2000, concluded her campaign entirely in April 2000, and paid her only $300,000 of the $1 million contracted for her involvement.|$|E
2500|$|A {{foreign-born}} {{woman and}} usurper of the Russian throne, Catherine the Great held no legitimate {{claim to the}} crown. Her sole connection with the house of Romanov derived from her marriage to the late Emperor, Peter III, whose murder she was widely known to have orchestrated. The royals who held genealogical claims to the throne overtly devised plots to replace the new Tsarina. Both Ivan VI and Paul I, armed with supporters, threatened Catherine's rule, {{as well as the}} guards who possessed the military might to overthrow the Empress. In a letter to Voltaire on September 21, 1762, Catherine acknowledged the conspirators and potential traitors all around her: [...] "Every guardsman when he looks at me can say: 'I made that woman.'" [...] A shrewd politician, Catherina also knew <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>the</b> support of the Court, the public, and other powerful regimes in order to maintain power, suppress rebellion, and emerge as a leading world power.|$|E

[...] Hook says Merlin must have a better solution, but she says that he canât help them anymore. Hook asks what happened to Merlin, and he asks her again why sheâs really doing this. Mary asks David and Regina how Emma can use Zelena to end dark magic, but they can't figure it out. Regina says no one hurts her sister except for her and tells them sheâs going to show Emma what dark magic is really like. Mary Margaret and David argue with Regina over going to war with Emma. Regina says Emma gave her the dagger because they knew {{she was the only one}} who could act. Emma comes out and says when sheâs done with Zelena, they will all be better off. Regina says that his is not right, but Emma says she knows Regina will be happier when Zelena is gone. Emma uses Excalibur to freeze them, while putting up a magic barrier around the house.|$|E
