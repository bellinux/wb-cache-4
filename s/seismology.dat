5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of <b>seismology</b> of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, <b>seismology,</b> spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E

Small contributions to the economy come by {{the way of the}} sale of traditional arts and crafts of Sikkim and Tibet. Government efforts related to sericulture, <b>seismology,</b> and fisheries provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents.|$|E
5|$|The Showa Station is Japan's main {{research}} station in Antarctica. A {{vast array of}} research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, <b>seismology,</b> gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, oceanography, glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened {{as part of a}} major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations.|$|E
5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high seismicity in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of <b>seismology.</b> In 1876, John Milne came from England to teach at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to <b>seismology</b> as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake reporting system that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided data by which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed a law of decay for aftershocks.|$|E
25|$|Coronal <b>seismology</b> {{is a new}} way of {{studying}} the plasma of the solar corona with the use of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids—in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal <b>seismology</b> is similar to the Earth's <b>seismology,</b> the Sun's helioseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal <b>seismology</b> in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density scale height, fine structure and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} discipline concerning {{such devices}} is called seismometry, {{a branch of}} <b>seismology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Polarization is an {{important}} parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as optics, <b>seismology,</b> radio, and microwaves. Especially impacted are technologies such as lasers, wireless and optical fiber telecommunications, and radar.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring mass {{movements}} and -failures uses techniques lending from <b>seismology</b> (geophones), deformation, and meteorology. Landslides, rock falls, pyroclastic flows, and mud flows (lahars) are example of mass failures of volcanic material before, during, and after eruptions.|$|E
25|$|Timely {{forecasts}} of an eruption by {{scientists from the}} Philippine Institute of Volcanology and <b>Seismology</b> and the U.S. Geological Survey enabled people living near the volcano to quickly evacuate to safer distances, saving at least 5,000 lives.|$|E
25|$|In 1891 Omori was {{appointed}} assistant to Sekiya and in 1893 lecturer on <b>seismology</b> at the Imperial University. In 1895, {{he was sent}} to Germany and Italy for additional study and visited England briefly on his way home in September, 1896.|$|E
25|$|Posidonius {{wrote on}} physics (including {{meteorology}} and physical geography), astronomy, astrology and divination, <b>seismology,</b> geology and mineralogy, hydrology, botany, ethics, logic, mathematics, history, natural history, anthropology, and tactics. His studies were major investigations into their subjects, although not without errors.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{seismometer}} is {{a digital}} strong-motion seismometer, or accelerograph. The data {{from such an}} instrument is essential to understand how an earthquake affects man-made structures, through earthquake engineering. The recordings of such instruments are crucial {{for the assessment of}} seismic hazard, through engineering <b>seismology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sound {{waves in}} solid {{materials}} exhibit polarization. Differential propagation {{of the three}} polarizations through the earth is a crucial {{in the field of}} <b>seismology.</b> Horizontally and vertically polarized seismic waves (shear waves)are termed SH and SV, while waves with longitudinal polarization (compressional waves) are termed P-waves.|$|E
25|$|Under many-body theory, {{the term}} is also used in physics, {{specifically}} in quantum field theory, aerodynamics, aeroacoustics, electrodynamics, <b>seismology</b> and statistical field theory, to refer to various types of correlation functions, even {{those that do not}} fit the mathematical definition. In quantum field theory, Green's functions take the roles of propagators.|$|E
25|$|Despite the eruption, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and <b>Seismology</b> {{stated that}} the alert level would remain at 0. No {{volcanic}} earthquake activity was detected in the 24 hours prior to the eruption, and no indication of further intensification of volcanic activity was observed. and no evacuation was being planned.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{disciplinary}} focused {{teaching and}} research within the academic faculties, the university maintains a number of interdisciplinary research institutes and centres at the national, state and university levels. For example, the Asia-Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, the University of Queensland <b>Seismology</b> Station, Heron Island Research Station and the Institute of Modern Languages.|$|E
25|$|Omori studied physics {{with the}} initial British foreign advisors serving as professors at the Imperial University of Tokyo, {{especially}} John Milne until he left Japan in 1895, as well as Japanese colleagues including Seikei Sekiya who in 1880 became the first professor of <b>seismology</b> at any university {{in the world at}} Tokyo Imperial University.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was discovered using reflection <b>seismology</b> in the 1960s, although the initial interpretations were distorted due to high-pressure zones in the overlying tertiary rocks causing low seismic velocities. However, the high porosity of the reservoir rock does cause {{an increase in}} seismic amplitude {{which can be used}} with an isopach map to determine net pay.|$|E
25|$|Permanent {{settlement}} {{on the island}} is prohibited by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and <b>Seismology</b> or PHIVOLCS, declaring the whole Volcano Island as a high-risk area and a Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ). Despite the warnings, poor families have settled on the island, risking their lives, earning a living by fishing and farming crops from the rich volcanic soil.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and <b>Seismology</b> (PHIVOLCS) {{reported}} several inactive volcanoes in the province: Amorong, Balungao, Cabaluyan, Cahelietan, Candong, and Malabobo. PHIVOLCS {{reported no}} active or potentially active volcanoes in Pangasinan. A caldera-like landform is located between {{the towns of}} Malasiqui and Villasis with a center at about 15° 55′ N and 120° 30′ E near the Cabaruan Hills.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is {{a branch of}} the science of <b>seismology</b> concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits. Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the volcano}} has been quiet since 1977, it has shown signs of unrest since 1991, with strong seismic {{activity}} and ground fracturing events, {{as well as}} the formation of small mud pots and mud geysers on parts of the island. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and <b>Seismology</b> (PHIVOLCS) regularly issues notices and warnings about current activity at Taal, including ongoing seismic unrest.|$|E
25|$|Seismic loading means {{application}} of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground, with adjacent structures, or with gravity waves from tsunami. The loading {{that is expected}} at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering <b>seismology.</b> It {{is related to the}} seismic hazard of the location.|$|E
25|$|The Van der Pol {{equation}} has a {{long history}} of being used in both the physical and biological sciences. For instance, in biology, Fitzhugh and Nagumo extended the equation in a planar field as a model for action potentials of neurons. The equation has also been utilised in <b>seismology</b> to model the two plates in a geological fault, and in studies of phonation to model the right and left vocal fold oscillators.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Hooke's law is an {{accurate}} approximation for most solid bodies, {{as long as the}} forces and deformations are small enough. For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as <b>seismology,</b> molecular mechanics and acoustics. It is also the fundamental principle behind the spring scale, the manometer, and the balance wheel of the mechanical clock.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{waves in}} solids are {{composed}} of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and {{a different type of}} sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in <b>seismology.</b> The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear modulus and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.|$|E
