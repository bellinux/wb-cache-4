5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E

500|$|Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire {{missiles}} at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting {{him but he}} deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views {{on the relationship between}} mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss; later at a CIA debriefing, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no memory of recent events. Elsewhere Lehnsherr, now calling himself [...] "Magneto", frees Frost from confinement.|$|E

On October 14, 2001, JoLinda {{declared}} that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church. Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas {{to be with his}} mom, who he believed was clean and sober {{for the first time in}} his life.

500|$|Jamestown has {{now been}} built and Walter tells his wife Alice about Powhatan’s victory over Miami. They then discuss a banquet hosted by Powhatan that Smith, Rolfe and Percy will attend. Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he was wrong about her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster. [...] Grimosco is taken away, and Miami stabs himself in shame. [...] Everyone else has a happy ending: Pocahontas is with Rolfe, Walter is with Alice, Larry is with Kate, Percy is with Geraldine, and even Robin is with Nima.

2500|$|A {{scientist}} {{claims she}} was infected by a genetically modified virus {{while working for}} Pfizer. In her federal lawsuit <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been intermittently paralyzed by the Pfizer-designed virus.

[...] The court found that McClain failed to demonstrate that her illness was caused by exposure to the lentivirus, but also that Pfizer violated whistleblower laws.|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{theatrical}} {{release of}} the film differs slightly from the US release in plot and running time. In the UK release, Kowalski picks up a mysterious hitchhiker (Charlotte Rampling) {{toward the end of}} the film. Kowalski accepts marijuana from her, despite refusing marijuana in several previous scenes. He stops the car when he starts feeling stoned. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been [...] "waiting for him, everywhere and since forever." [...] When he awakens the next morning, she is gone without a trace. According to interviews with Barry Newman and commentary from the director, the hitchhiker was meant to be an allegorical figure representing death. This scene was removed from the final US version, reducing the film from 105 minutes to 98 minutes. Newman felt that the scene gave the film [...] "an allegorical lift" [...] but the studio was afraid that the audience would not understand.|$|E

50|$|Botman {{received}} a B.A. in psychology from Brandeis University even though <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{no interest in}} the field.

At this time she developed an interest in the Middle East but believed {{it was too late to}} change majors and thus stayed with psychology until graduation.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about being bisexual: [...] "'Shall I tell you about getting older?', she says, and she is laughing. 'When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?' <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been in love seven times in her life. 'No, hang on,' she says. 'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time}} of Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E

As the manifestation tries to goad Emma into {{lighting}} the flame, Emma loses her temper and yells at him to stop. Henry finds Emma talking to herself, and he asks what she’s doing, and what the [...] "voices" [...] said. Emma says that they told her she wasn’t ready to give up the darkness. He shows her a photo of a house that he and Hook were looking at for their Operation Light Swan, which Hook planned to obtain for Emma after she was free of the Darkness. Henry tells her that it was a reminder of something she could look forward to. Emma shuts the lid on the spark and says that she's not ready to give up the darkness just yet, because she has to use her dark magic one more time.|$|E
