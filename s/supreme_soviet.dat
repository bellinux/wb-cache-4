5|$|Shostakovich {{achieved}} fame in the Soviet Union {{under the}} patronage of Soviet {{chief of staff}} Mikhail Tukhachevsky, but later had a complex and difficult relationship with the government. Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> of the RSFSR (1947–1962) and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death).|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{of government in}} the Armenian SSR was identical {{to that of the}} other Soviet republics. The highest political body of the republic was the Armenian <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> which included the highest judicial branch of the republic, the supreme court. Members of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> served for a term of five years, whereas regional deputies served {{for two and a half}} years. All officials holding office were mandated to be members of the Communist Party and sessions were convened in the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> building in Yerevan.|$|E
5|$|When Belarus became {{independent}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Belarus passed the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, proclaiming Byelorussian SSR acts legal priority over USSR ones (per article 7 of the Declaration, but this provision was inserted into 1978 Constitution only in August 1991) and formally starting a constitutional process in Republic. Soon afterwards, the government established a Constitution Commission {{to facilitate the}} adoption of a post-Soviet constitution. In November 1991, the commission sent the first of three drafts to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> Upon approval from the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> the first draft was published in December 1991 in order for the Belarusian populace to make comments and suggestions. The commission submitted the third and final draft to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> where it was signed on March 15, 1994 by the Speaker of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> and Head of State, Myechyslaw Hryb. The gazette Zvezda officially published the Constitution fifteen days later. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> passed a second law along with the Constitution, titled the Enactment Law, rendering the 1978 Byelorussian SSR Constitution and the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic void, with a few exceptions. The law, passed during the thirteenth session of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> also provided transitional phases for office holders and government organs to form within two years. Every year since 1994, March 15 has been commemorated in Belarus as Constitution Day, a national holiday.|$|E

The disguised <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets</b> battled the Soviet Super-Soldiers, defeating them and beating them severely, leaving them in critical condition.|$|R

5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related to}} the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> quashed the measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, a plenum of the Central Committee (CC) forbade {{any single}} {{individual}} {{to hold the}} two most powerful posts of the country (the office of the General Secretary and the premier), and Kosygin {{was in charge of}} economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However Kosygin's position was weakened when he proposed an economic reform in 1965. Under the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government of the USSR. The premier was the chief of the executive branch and head of the union government as a whole, the premiership was the highest governmental office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition until the establishment of the Presidency in 1990. The premier was responsible and accountable to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> and in the period between sessions of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> accountable to the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> The premier was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction of the USSR to the degree that it did not come under the competence of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> or the Presidium. The premier managed the national economy, formulated the five-year plans and ensured socio-cultural development.|$|E

50|$|People's Doctor of the USSR (Народный врач СССР) was {{an honorary}} title granted to {{citizens}} of the Soviet Union; it was established on 25 October 1977 by Leonid Brezhnev and its creation was officialized on the n°44/1977 issue of <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet's</b> official journal. Its regulation was later modified and completed by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet's</b> decree of 22 August 1988.|$|R

50|$|The synthezoid {{originally}} {{known as}} Sputnik {{was a member}} of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets.</b> The team had been sent by the Soviet government to capture the Soviet Super-Soldiers, who were attempting to defect to the United States.

5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Belarus {{was formed}} in 1991 shortly after declaring itself {{independent}} of the Soviet Union. Under {{the government of the}} Byelorussian SSR, the de facto leader of the Soviet Republic was the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the only legal party in Soviet Belarus. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the Chairman of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> was the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. When {{the office of the presidency}} was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> along with its Chairman, in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E

The title could be bestowed to individual medical doctors and nurses but also to health care structures as general hospitals, sanatoriums, maternity wards or preventive medicine centres.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, was {{a special}} {{operative}} for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared {{as a member of}} the militant <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Alongside the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets,</b> he attacked the Soviet Super-Soldiers for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the Darkforce. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets</b> later became known as the People's Protectorate. Alongside the People's Protectorate, he teamed with the Avengers and Alpha Flight to battle the Peace Corpse, the Atlantean Army, and the Combine. Petkus later joined post-Soviet Russian super-team the Winter Guard, now calling himself the [...] "Steel Guardian". While fighting off Dire Wraiths, he is killed in the line of duty.|$|R
5|$|On 15 July 1964, Mikoyan was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> replacing Leonid Brezhnev, {{who received a}} promotion within the Party.

5|$|The Ministry of Justice {{was headed}} by a Minister who was elected by the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> between seasons, and {{authenticated}} by a <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> convocation. Deputy Ministers were elected by the Council of Ministers; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed {{his or her own}} department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the Board of the Ministry of Justice. The members of this board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were as a rule implemented nationwide. If the board disagreed they sought the assistance of the Council of Ministers to solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5000|$|The Crimson Dynamo's armor was repaired, and {{he joined}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets,</b> a group of superhumans who were loyal to the Soviet {{government}}. Meanwhile, the Soviet Super-Soldiers sought asylum from the Russian government at Avengers' headquarters. The Crimson Dynamo, along with the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets</b> disguised themselves {{as members of the}} Avengers, and attacked his former teammates brutally, leaving them for dead. The three heroes' spirits took on a [...] "Great Beast" [...] energy form and attacked Moscow, and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets</b> tried to stop the creature but were absorbed into it. The dying heroes intended to have revenge by killing their assassins, but Captain America convinced them to let the others live.|$|R

5|$|During his lifetime, Kosygin {{received}} seven Orders and two Awards {{from the}} Soviet state. He was awarded two Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR); one being on his 60th birthday by the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> in 1964, {{on this occasion}} he was also awarded an Order of Lenin and a Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. On 20 February 1974, to commemorate his 70th birthday, the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> awarded him another Order of Lenin and his second Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. In total, Kosygin was awarded six Orders of Lenin by the Soviet state, and one Order of the October Revolution and one Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During a state visit to Peru in the 1970s with Leonid Brezhnev and Andrei Gromyko, all three were awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun by President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. The Moscow State Textile University was named in his honour in 1981, in 1982 a bust to honour Kosygin was placed in Leningrad, present day Saint Petersburg. In 2006 the Russian Government renamed a street after him.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|Mikoyan {{made several}} key trips to {{communist}} Cuba {{and to the}} United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.|$|E
