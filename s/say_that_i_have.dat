5|$|I King Æthelstan, {{declare that}} I {{have learned that}} the public peace has not been kept to the extent, either of my wishes, or of the {{provisions}} laid down at Grately, and my councillors <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered this too long.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E

500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E
500|$|Negatively, Mika was {{included}} in Complexs list of the [...] "lamest" [...] Street Fighter characters, reasoning [...] "Street Fighter has never been shy with the gorgeous ladies, but they've always had full-figured back stories {{to go along with}} their full-figured backsides. Rainbow Mika on the other hand is the most blatant example of mysogynistic [...] character design seen in the series." [...] Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network declared Mika as [...] "the worst Street Fighter character," [...] reasoning [...] "every little detail about her annoyed me, from the stupid boob-hearts on her costume to the way she whomped opponents with her butt—and rubbed it after she hit the ground." [...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nothing against, er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E
500|$|In 1863–1864 {{during the}} American Civil War, Edward {{traveled}} through Europe, taking {{the opportunity to}} visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father {{later on in the}} war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests [...] Edward's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, [...] "I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> gone to Europe to avoid the war." [...] Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to the Netherlands, the {{harmonica}} band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band [...] He would meet a number of influential acts who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the Hot Club de France and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserts, [...] "I can honestly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never heard anyone better". The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940 he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 {{he was part of the}} entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942 Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{following}} morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel {{had anything to}} say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: [...] "I have to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been found guilty by a packed jury—by the jury of a partisan sheriff—by a jury not empanelled even {{according to the law}} of England. That is the reason I object to the sentence being passed upon me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is true {{that the}} music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the {{so-called}} difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And I must <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> noticed, as we have held our ground, {{that there has been a}} softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Ryelandt wrote a {{great deal}} of vocal music, his ideal was {{absolute}} music. But there was an ideal beyond that. For Ryelandt, music was a religious vocation. The following words from the preface to his Notices sur mes oeuvres sum up what really mattered to him: “I think … I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not been a useless servant of art. I have done what I could. The future will decide if anything of this work will survive me to the greater glory of God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dave Rat, the band's sound {{engineer}} since February 1991, announced that following the band's show of January 22, 2017 {{he would no}} longer be working with the band. [...] "I truly love Flea, Anthony, Chad, Josh and all my dear and close friends I consider family both on the road now and those that have moved on to other adventures over the years. I am pretty happy to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> dedicated significant time documenting touring with Peppers in journals but also have thousands of amazing photos spanning decades of smiles and challenges" [...] Rat said.|$|E
2500|$|... "Inner Child" [...] was {{the first}} episode to air after a two-month hiatus. It was delayed by about 30 minutes because American Idol ran long for the night. The episode won its ad-hoc 9:30–10:30 Eastern timeslot, with about 9.6 million live viewers and a 9 share among viewers 18–49. Fringe also helped Fox win the night in total number of viewers. When asked by a {{reporter}} if he was [...] "infuriated" [...] with Fox because of the Idol-induced delay, co-creator J.J. Abrams replied [...] "I will <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a different opinion about the network, but I, too, have heard {{from a number of}} people [...] It is infuriating".|$|E

2500|$|Palmerston {{was then}} at the University of Edinburgh (1800–1803), where he learnt {{political}} economy from Dugald Stewart, {{a friend of the}} Scottish philosophers Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith. Palmerston later described his time at Edinburgh as producing [...] "whatever useful knowledge and habits of mind I possess". Lord Minto wrote to Palmerston's parents that young Palmerston was well-mannered and charming. Stewart wrote to a friend, saying of Palmerston: [...] "In point of temper and conduct he is everything his friends could wish. Indeed, I cannot <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen a more faultless character at this time of life, or one possessed of more amiable dispositions".|$|E
2500|$|She and Robert {{first met}} violinist Joseph Joachim in November 1844, {{when he was}} just of age 14. A year later she wrote in her diary that in a concert on Nov. 11, 1845 [...] "little Joachim was very much liked. He played a new violin concerto of Mendelssohn's, which is said to be wonderful". In May 1853 they heard Joachim play the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto. Clara wrote that he played [...] "with a finish, a depth of poetic feeling, his whole soul in every note, so ideally, that I have never heard violin-playing like it, and I can truly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never {{received}} so indelible an impression from any virtuoso." [...] From that time there was a friendship between Clara and Joachim, which [...] "for more than forty years never failed Clara in things great or small, never wavered in its loyalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 March 2008, {{during a}} {{surprise}} visit to pray at {{the tomb of}} Saint Francis in Assisi, Italy, Gorbachev made an announcement which has been interpreted {{to the effect that}} he was a Christian. Gorbachev stated: [...] "St Francis is, for me, the alter Christus, another Christ. His story fascinates me and has played a fundamental role in my life". He added: [...] "It was through St Francis that I arrived at the Church, so it was important that I came to visit his tomb". However, a few days later, he reportedly told the Russian news agency Interfax: [...] "Over the last few days some media have been disseminating fantasies—I can't use any other word—about my secret Catholicism, [...] To sum up and avoid any misunderstandings, let me <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been and remain an atheist", to which the contemporary Orthodox patriarch replied, [...] "He is still on his way to Christianity".|$|E
6000|$|Nigel {{scratched}} his head. [...] "Surely, fair sir, I would {{be content to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen a number of lions, if indeed I could say aught after so wondrous an adventure." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I never {{understood}} my own nature before," [...] said Stephens. [...] "I can hardly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a nature to understand. I lived {{for what was}} unimportant, and I neglected what was vital." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Vibe, record producer Boi-1da confirmed working significantly {{on the album}} saying, [...] "It’s new-age with that old Mobb twist to it. I was {{a big fan of}} Mobb Deep and Havoc's production, so I just reached out and me and him have been producing records together, sending stuff back and forth. I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some records on the new Mobb Deep album that me and Havoc did together. It’s something I knocked off my bucket list." [...] During an {{interview with}} XXL and Prodigy later that month, he stated that Havoc, The Alchemist, Illmind and Boi-1da would provide production on the album. He also elaborated on the unreleased material saying that it would contain never before heard skits and verses by Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Nas, N.O.R.E. and Mobb Deep. Prodigy then confirmed in March 2014, that the album would feature rappers Bun B and Juicy J on a song called [...] "Legendary". The track listing revealed guest appearances on the album from French Montana, The LOX, Bun B, Juicy J, Mack Wilds, Big Noyd, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Darwin's health {{had failed}} again, but after a week's {{hydrotherapy}} {{he was able to}} start correcting the proofs. He struggled on despite rarely being able to write free of stomach pains for more than twenty minutes at a stretch, and made drastic revisions which left Murray with a huge £72 bill for corrections. Murray upped the print run to 1,250 copies, with a publication date in November. A copy was sent to Lyell, with a [...] "foolishly anxious" [...] Darwin hoping that he would [...] "come round". An eager Lyell gave Darwin [...] "very great kudos", though he was still concerned that [...] "the dignity of man is at stake". One of Lyell's relatives commented that it was [...] "sure to be very curious and important... however mortifying it may be to think that our remote ancestors were jelly fishes". Darwin was [...] "sorry to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no 'consolatory view' on the dignity of man. I am content that man will probably advance, and care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a remotely distant future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Burke, an English {{political}} thinker, {{was impressed}} by the work of Barruel in uncovering a connection between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Burke wrote a letter to Barruel and expressed his admiration. He wrote, [...] "I cannot easily express to you how much I am instructed and delighted by the first volume of your History of Jacobinism." [...] He praised [...] "the whole of the wonderful narrative" [...] for being supported by documents and proofs with [...] "the most judicial regularity and exactness." [...] At the end of the letter Burke added: [...] "I forgot to <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known myself, personally, five of your principal conspirators; and I can undertake to say from my own certain knowledge, that {{as far back as the}} year 1773, they were busy in the plot you have so well described, and in the manner, and on the principle you have so truly represented. To this I can speak as a witness." [...] Burkes own works were also filled with references to the philosophe sect and a dislike for their fanaticism, atheism and perversion of public morals.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Pa. <b>I</b> {{think we}} <b>had</b> better not enter into {{particulars}} at home. I {{think it will}} be quite enough to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a difference with Mr Boffin, and have left for good.' ...|$|R
