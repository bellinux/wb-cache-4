Wad Khatib is the most common variety of date trees in Dar al-Manasir and the neighbouring Rubatab Country.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is deciduous oak forest: both sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur), with European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and hazels in {{the coolest}} and deepest soil {{at the bottom}} of the valley. The mountain layer is characterised by the presence of beeches and at times, in the Pyrenees, by silver firs (Abies alba); these beeches and silver firs occupy the cool slopes with <b>shallow</b> <b>soil.</b> The Mediterranean influence is felt in the presence of Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) with bay laurel, which are situated on the warmest crests and slopes, especially above chalky soil, where the dryness becomes more pronounced.|$|E

25|$|Farmers {{cleared the}} land of trees and drained the swamps, but farming was {{difficult}} due to the glacial till beneath the <b>shallow</b> <b>soil.</b> Other settlers turned to the natural resources left by the glaciers and mined sand and gravel deposits. Limestone and clay mines were opened in the area; shale was discovered and was mined, as well as bituminous coal. Coal mining was a profitable enterprise and seven coal beds were deep mined and later strip mined. Later still, wells were drilled to extract {{oil and natural gas}} from deep within the Earth. When the mines were cleared and the wells tapped out, the land was left barren. Since the mines were left uncapped, the topsoil eroded from the land.|$|E
25|$|From {{the base}} to the summit, floral species {{diminish}} with increasingly <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> levels. The summit {{is home to}} many different specialized sub-alpine species which can retain moisture {{for long periods of}} time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.|$|E
500|$|The {{largest of}} the tree species in this virgin {{timbershed}} was the white oak (Quercus alba), which often exceeded [...] in height and [...] in diameter. While the white oak's range encompasses most of the Eastern United States, the most favorable environments for its growth are on the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. According to botanist Earl Lemley Core, the species flourishes on northern mountain flanks, and in coves, which are small valleys or ravines between two ridge lines that are closed at one or both ends. White oaks also thrive in moist lowlands and in upland topography, {{with the exception of}} extremely dry ridges with <b>shallow</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

Expeditions in the early and mid-1960s failed to identify any specimens, but in 1969, ethnobotanist Douglas E. Yen of the Bishop Museum collected specimens near Miller Peak. Derral R. Herbst and Wayne Takeuchi of the FWS collected the last known specimen on July 27, 1980. Carl C. Christensen also visited Nihoa in 1980 to reevaluate endemic species last observed on the Tanager Expedition. Sheila Conant and Mark S. Collins visited Nihoa in 1980 as well; Conant returned twice in 1981, first with Mark J. Rauzon and later with Audrey L. Newman. In 1983, Conant visited the island with Wayne C. Gagné. Conant found A. brownii growing on the island in 1981 and 1983, by which time only two populations of 35 plants were thought to exist: 23 plants were found near Miller Peak and 12 plants in Middle Valley. The two plant populations are separated by a distance of approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|Another policy (known as [...] "deep plowing") {{was based}} on the ideas of Lysenko's {{colleague}} Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal plowing depths of 15–20 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in <b>shallow</b> <b>soil,</b> useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and again severely stunting seedling growth.|$|E

The Ozark Plateaus aquifer system affects groundwater movement in all areas except the igneous core of the St. Francois Mountains. Geographic features include limestone and dolomite glades, which are rocky, desert-like area on hilltops.

2500|$|Counter-mining {{activity}} by the Tunnelling Companies RE began at St Eloi {{in the spring}} of 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The Ypres area has a <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer of loam or sand above waterlogged semi-liquid sand and patches of sand and clay called slurry. Beneath the second layer is a thick seam of blue clay. The early mining took place above the blue clay which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works. In August the digging of galleries had begun to be ready by the end of June 1916. Both sides spent 1915 mining and counter-mining, the British springing [...] and [...] against [...] mines and [...] In September, Brigadier-General George Fowke the Engineer in Chief, proposed a mining offensive in the blue clay [...] underground. Since the Germans were on the higher ground, galleries could be driven horizontally into the blue clay from shafts about [...] back from the front line. By January 1916, the 172nd Tunnelling Company had sunk shafts into the blue clay and began to dig galleries [...] under the German front position. After the Second Army offensive in the summer of 1916 was postponed the mining offensive was made even more ambitious, with a plan to mine Messines Ridge.|$|E

40|$|On upland Triassic {{sandstone}} {{slopes of}} the western Blue Mountains, nonswamp, sclerophyllous heath (shrub-dominated vegetation) on <b>shallow</b> <b>soils</b> is commonly found downslope and adjacent to sclerophyllous forest on deeper soils. Some consider heath—and thus shallow soils—as favouring west-facing slopes, which are expected to experience drier microclimates due to insolation, strong and desiccating winds, and severe summer fires. However, our analysis of extensive areas with heath on <b>shallow</b> <b>soils,</b> based on vegetation and topographic maps, and fieldwork of uplands with various degrees of dissection, suggests that aspect is a poor predictor of <b>shallow</b> <b>soils.</b> Rather, <b>shallow</b> <b>soils</b> and heath are found on short slopes and the lower segments of longer slopes with the latter significantly steeper than forested segments. The shallow–deep soil boundary, marked by contrasting modern vegetation structures, does not signify a catchment area threshold, and correspondingly, the vegetation patterns are not in balance with distributary catchment processes, as short slopes are mantled exclusively by <b>shallow</b> <b>soils.</b> Instead, the soil depth boundary represents the propagation of base-level lowering signals, which takes place {{not only by the}} headward retreat of knickpoints but also via increased lowering of slope segments adjacent to drainage lines. This leads to steep slopes immediately adjacent to canyons, narrow gorges, and small steep valleys, that are mantled by <b>shallow,</b> discontinuous <b>soils</b> undergoing rapid erosion. These steep slopes persist in the landscape for ≥ 10 My after upland stream rejuvenation until incision of more weatherable Permian sediments, underlying the Triassic cliff-forming sandstones, triggers rapid lateral expansion of gorges. Once shallowly mantled and steeper slopes adjacent to streams are consumed by gorge widening, slopes adjacent to wide gorge clifflines reflect former upland drainage patterns rather than the redirected flow to rapidly widening gorges. Hence, modern vegetation patterns reflect a significant phase of landform development, perhaps combined with enhanced erosion during the Last Glacial Period that is compounded by a humped soil production function on bedrock. 16 page(s...|$|R
