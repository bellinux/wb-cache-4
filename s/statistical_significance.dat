5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved <b>statistical</b> <b>significance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of these objects. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion of 180–340° have argument of perihelion 0–40°. The <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of perihelion of ETNOs with perihelion less than 35 AU are opposite those with perihelion greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for <b>statistical</b> <b>significance.</b> This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

25|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>significance</b> of {{supporting}} experimental results does not improve {{over time and}} are usually close to the cutoff for <b>statistical</b> <b>significance.</b> Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence.

25|$|A {{series of}} steps are {{involved}} in analysis of CAPP-Seq data from mutation detection to validation and open source software can {{do most of the}} analysis. After the first step of variant calling, germline and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations are removed in CAPP-seq to reduce the background biases. Several <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> tests can be performed against background to all type of variant calling. For example, <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> of tumor-derived SNVs can be estimated by random sampling of background alleles using Monte Carlo method. For the indel calls, <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> is calculated applying a separate method that used a strand specific analysis by Z-test shown in previous work. Finally, a computational validation steps reduces the false positive calls. However, a robust computational framework specific for CAPP-seq data analysis is a high demand in this field.|$|E
30|$|The {{data were}} {{expressed}} as mean ± standard deviation (SD). <b>Statistical</b> <b>significances</b> of differences among treatments {{were determined by}} use of analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s pair-wise comparisons. A significant difference was presumed at a P value < 0.05.|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed using t test and using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

30|$|Data are {{represented}} as mean with standard deviation or mean with standard error of mean. <b>Statistical</b> <b>significances</b> were calculated by one way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post test using GraphPad Prism.

25|$|The {{use of the}} p-value in {{statistics}} was {{popularized by}} Ronald Fisher, and it plays {{a central role in}} his approach to the subject. In his influential book Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1925), Fisher proposes the level p = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for <b>statistical</b> <b>significance,</b> and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> (see 68–95–99.7 rule).|$|E
25|$|Rigidly {{requiring}} <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> as {{a criterion}} for publication, resulting in publication bias. Most of the criticism is indirect. Rather than being wrong, statistical hypothesis testing is misunderstood, overused and misused.|$|E
25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis <b>statistical</b> <b>significance</b> test. The null hypothesis represents {{what we would}} believe by default, before seeing any evidence. <b>Statistical</b> <b>significance</b> is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the very}} broad scope of our study, we built the first {{comprehensive}} bridge between logistics research (especially LSP-oriented studies) {{on the one hand}} and financial research (especially CoC-oriented studies) on the other hand.

40|$|Objective: This {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects of Sopungdojeok-tang(SPDJT) and Samulsopung-san(SMSPS) which were used to treat patient with atopic dermatitis Methods: Anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects of SPDJT and SMSPS were measured by the inhibitory ability of Nitric oxide(NO) production and the scavenging for 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl(DPPH) radical. Results: 1. SPDJT and SMSPS were not showed cell toxicity. 2. In inhibitory effects against NO production, all groups of SPDJT were showed anti-inflammation, but all groups of SMSPS were not showed anti-inflammation. There were <b>statistical</b> <b>significances</b> between 20 ㎍/㎖ and 4, 10 ㎍/㎖ in SPDJT groups. 3. In DPPH radical scavenging activity, all groups of SPDJT and all groups of SMSPS were showed anti-oxidant effects. There were <b>statistical</b> <b>significances</b> between 20 ㎍/㎖ SPDJT group and 4, 10 ㎍/㎖ SMSPS groups.
