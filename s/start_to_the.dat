5|$|Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{in place of}} Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs to a good <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2009–10 season. Hibs finished fourth and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. A poor <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> following season, including first round exits in Europe and the League Cup, led to Hughes leaving the club by mutual consent. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who was himself sacked on 6 November 2011.|$|E

5|$|The club {{lost their}} talismanic Turk Muzzy Izzet {{in the summer}} of 2004. Adams had {{previously}} stated his concern that they would be unable to regain their top tier status before he resigned as Leicester manager in October 2004, after a poor <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Championship campaign dashed the club's hopes of an instant return to the Premiership.|$|E
5|$|Upon its formation, F.C. United {{appointed}} Karl Marginson as its manager. He led {{the team}} to four promotions, three league titles, two league cups and a county cup.

5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also coincided with a change in management at the club, after a poor <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season left Shrewsbury rooted to the bottom of the League One table. Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E
5|$|A poor <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1966–67 season {{prevented}} another {{push for}} the title, and Leeds eventually finished in fourth place.

5|$|A strong <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season saw Arsenal top {{the league}} table by September. Defeat against Sevilla in November ended {{a run of}} 28 matches undefeated {{and it was not}} until a month after did the team lose in the league for the first time, away at Middlesbrough. Arsenal {{extended}} their league lead to five points in February, but a career-threatening injury to Eduardo against Birmingham City coincided with the team going on a run of four draws in the Premier League. Manchester United soon overtook them in first and defeat to Chelsea in March moved Arsenal down in third place, where they remained {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

Given missed two Premier League games as the club finished in 14th place.|$|E
5|$|After a {{promising}} <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1996–97, Everton were beaten {{six times in}} a row after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
