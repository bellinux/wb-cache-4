50|$|Many {{legends and}} {{stories have been}} linked with the cave, the {{existence}} {{of which has been}} common knowledge in the Languedoc region since time immemorial. The best known legend tells of a shepherd looking for a lost lamb who wandered into the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> that marked the entrance to the cave. He heard the lamb but could not see it, and so he continued deeper and deeper into the cave, until he reached the chamber now known as the cathédrale (cathedral). With only a torch for light, he slipped and fell {{to the bottom of the}} chamber (a 60-metre plunge between stalactites and stalagmites). Knocked senseless by the shock, he noticed - just before passing out - a group of young ladies dancing and singing around him. When he woke up, he was back on the surface with his lamb. The modern name of the cave, Grotte des Demoiselles (“maidens' grotto”) reflects this legend; previously it had been known as the Grotte des Fées (“fairies' grotto”).|$|E
50|$|Its {{remarkable}} geology {{is mainly}} carboniferous limestone, {{and is the}} location of a turlough (lake) or disappearing lake. They are more frequent in Éire. The lake fills up in the autumn and winter, being fed only by groundwater. The lake disappears by the summer, and is the only known example in Britain.Pant-y-Llyn turlough occupies a small depression on the northern perimeter of the South Wales Coalfield at Cernydd Carmel. This depression represents a glacial channel formed along the Betws Fault where displacement has brought carboniferous limestone into contact with older impervious Devonian rock. The hydrological regime of the waterbody is linked to local groundwater behaviour within the limestone. The basin fills to a depth of about 3 m during late autumn and remains full until the following summer when it empties completely, thus reflecting the characteristic behaviour of turloughs. There are no surface drainage channels and a <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> is located at the northern end of the basin.|$|E

The Výpustek cave {{is located}} in the middle part of the Moravian Karst, which is the most known, largest and most karsted area in the Czech Reublic. Hydrogeology of the area is very interesting, {{surrounding}} terrain has greatly changed due to extensive changes in the last 100 years. Some swallow holes were blocked, others newly created as the Křtinský stream we didn ́t have map wit active swallow holes. Already in the mid- 20 th century, hydrogeology of Křtinský stream was studied by Czech researchers. We decided after nearly 60 -year break to continue with research of unknown karst water of Křtinský valley and we performed a new series of measurements. Total of 8 tracer experiments was previously performed and subsequently published on Křtinský stream. Two tracer tests were performed in research area of the Křtinský valley. The first test was carried out between <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> A and outf low (Burkhardt & Zedníček, 1950, 1951 – 1955), the second test was between <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> E and the outf low of Křtinský stream (Kůrkova et al. 2010) where I cooperated. Kůrkova et al. (2010) indicates distance between <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> E, localized before the Výpustek cave and the outflow of Křtinský stream as 3870 metres. From these values it was possible to determined that the distance between the first <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> A and fifth <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> E is 330 metres, among which are three more swallow holes B, C, D, which are activated only at higher water levels. The fluorescein was used as good visibly tracer for both realized tests. Both tests confirmed the relatively slow f low. In the first test the transit time after injection of tracer was 339 hours (14 days). Time when injected tracer has passed the second sampling site was 190 hours (8 days). It is necessary to take into consideration that Burkhardt & Zedníček (1950, 1951 – 1955) in 1948 performed a hydrographic experiment in which water lost only into the first two swallow holes (A and B). According to t he test resu lts in 1948 no active flow which clearly confirmed bifurcation of Křtinský stream was found in the Výpustek cave. It means that the first test, which was injected fluorescein into the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> A was injected into northern branch of the Křtinský stream. The second test in 2009 was performed by injecting f luorescein to the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> E implemented in the southern branch. Swallow holes A, B, C, D, E, F of the Křtinský stream were re-localized and new <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> known as “U smrku” was described. We performed an individual f low measurement with method of dilution in the research area of Křtinský stream. Following the test results, a reduction in absorption capacity of the main <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> E in the year 2009 was found. This <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> lost 50 % of water with f low rate 16 L • s– 1 since 2009. The <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> “U smrku” has shown an absorption capacity 54 % with f low rate of 8. 40 L s– 1. Hydrogeological problems of the Křtinský stream and surrounding platforms are very complicated and it would be beneficial to continue with the tracer measurements on affluents of the Křtinský stream.

40|$|In a karst system, the {{characterization}} of transport properties {{is based on the}} comparison of natural tracers observed at the inlet (a <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> on the karst plateau) and the outlets of the system (a spring and a well). At Norville, northwest France, electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity (T) were used as natural tracers for characterizing dissolved elements (surface water geochemistry) and particulate matter transport, respectively. Two methods were used for this study: (1) a comparison of the relations between EC, T and spring discharge (Q) by means of normalized EC–T–Q curves, and (2) a principal component analysis (PCA) including water geochemistry data in addition to EC, T and Q. Three different characteristic flood events have been chosen for the analyses. EC–T–Q curves highlighted the direct transfer, resuspension and deposition of particles during their transport in the karst network. Transport from the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> to both the spring and the well appeared to be dominated by karst-conduit flow.

40|$|The geomorphological {{characteristics}} and hydrogeological functioning of a geologically heterogeneous evaporitic karst plateau in Southern Spain were studied. Land surface information (LiDAR data) {{was used to}} analyze the shape and distribution of closed depressions. An artificial tracer test and monitoring of the natural responses of the main spring have allowed to infer the karstic development of the studied system. Three dyes were injected in selected <b>swallow</b> <b>holes</b> to trace the main groundwater flowpaths and to estimate the dimension of the conduit network. Discharge, electrical conductivity and temperature were monitored in the groundwater that drains the evaporitic plateau during an individual and intense recharge pulse. Tracing techniques were adapted to high salinity environments by using specific calibration standards (NaCl + dye). The hydrological connection detected between two of the <b>swallow</b> <b>holes</b> and the outlet, and the deduced orientation pattern for closed areas, would suggest that the karst evolution (internal and external) is related to fault orientation. The rapid tracer detection (16 - 20 h) and high estimated maximum flow velocities (125 - 192 m/h), together with the fast impulsional response of the controlled physical-chemical parameters in spring waters (~ 15 - 16 h) demonstrate the existence of quick flows under recharge conditions with well-defined system drainage, indicating a high degree of internal karstification (estimated master conduit diameter ~ 1. 5 m). However, flooding of the depressions feeding <b>swallow</b> <b>holes</b> and analysis of the spring response times from natural and artificial tracers point to a restriction of the system´s drainage, most likely due to the constrained morphology of the karst conduits.

40|$|Mobile {{particles}} play crucial {{roles for}} contaminant transport in karst aquifers, but {{few studies have}} investigated the relationships between sediment dynamics and contaminants. This {{is partly due to}} the difficulty in monitoring suspended particles: Turbidity is easy to measure but does not deliver detailed information on the size and type of particles; mineralogical laboratory analyses are laborious and not suitable for continuous monitoring. A portable particle counter was used for the study presented here. The instrument delivers time-series of particle-size distribution (PSD), i. e. the number and diameter of suspended particles, grouped into different size-classes ranging from 0. 9 to 139 μm. The test site is a karst system near the city of Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland. A <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> draining agricultural land is connected to two karst springs, 4. 8 and 6. 3 km away, which are occasionally contaminated by faecal bacteria at highly variable levels. Turbidity alone {{turned out not to be}} a reliable indicator for microbial contamination. To obtain more insight into bacteria and particle transport towards the springs, a comprehensive research program was carried out, including tracer tests and monitoring of PSD, turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), faecal bacteria(E. coli) and various hydrologic and physicochemical parameters. Results show that there are two types of turbidity: A primary turbidity signal occurs shortly after rainfall during the rising limb of the hydrograph; a secondary signal typically occurs during spring flow recession. The first signal is explained by remobilization of conduit sediments due to a hydraulic pressure pulse (autochthonous or pulse-through turbidity). The second peak indicates the arrival of water from the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole,</b> often together with TOC and faecal bacteria (allochthonous or flow-through turbidity). PSD analyses revealed that autochthonous turbidity is composed of a broad mixture of fine and large particles, while allochthonous turbidity predominantly consists of very fine particles. This is explained by sedimentation of larger particles between the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> and the springs. During allochthonous turbidity periods, very good correlation between the finest particles (0. 9 – 1. 5 μm) and E. coli was found (R 2 = 0. 93). The relative increase of fine particles can consequently be used as an “early-warning parameter” for microbial contamination of karst spring water. Further applicability and limitations of this approach are also discussed. </span...|$|E

These limitations can be resolved by the use of the statistical tool STATIS. The inlet (a <b>swallow</b> <b>hole)</b> and the outlet (a spring) of a karst system of the Western Paris basin were sampled during three rain events of various intensities. These 3 D geochemical data sets (variables 3 sites 3 dates) for a karst system were analyzed by STATIS method to identify hydrological processes. STATIS proceeds in three steps (interstructure, compromise, and intrastructure), which allows us to focus the analysis of hydrologic systems at different temporal and spatial scales. Compromise plane shows that suspended matter and flood are not simultaneous and highlights a rapid flow, characterized by turbidity and phosphate, which represents a point source contamination, and a ground water flow contaminated by nitrate. Intrastructure plane allows us to compare hydrochemical variations between the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> and the spring lead. By this way, hydrological processes such as direct transfer and resuspension of intrakarstic sediments before and after the flood were identified what cannot be realized by comparison of inlet and outlet breakthrough curves. Finally, results obtained from the same data set by STATIS and a coupled study using PCA and normalized hysteresis curves were compared. This comparison shows the efficiency of STATIS at the identification of transport processes and vulnerability of karst system and its potential for hydrological applications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the conditions promoting the transport of antibiotic-resistant faecal bacteria, in a rural karst system providing drinking water (Northwest France). For this purpose, the resistance of the Escherichia coli population (436 isolates) to 17 antibiotics was investigated by analysing water samples from four representative interconnected sites: a creek, a <b>swallow</b> <b>hole,</b> a spring, and a well. The samples were collected during four contrasting hydrologic and grazing periods. The transport of resistant E. coli from the creek to the well appeared to be dominated by run-off and leaching phenomena. Less than 7 % of the E. coli isolated during a wet period without grazing or during a dry period with grazing were antibiotic-resistant, whereas, during rainfall events with grazing, between 30 % and 55 % of the E. coli detected were resistant; 10 - 23 % of these isolates were resistant to two or three antibiotics. The resistance most often found was to either loramphenicol or tetracycline. To better describe the dynamics of the antibiotic-resistant population of E. coli entering the karst aquifer, the <b>swallow</b> <b>hole</b> was monitored over a 24 -h period during a rainfall event (90 isolates). The antibiotic resistance of E. coli isolates and the occurrence of class 1 integrons, genetic elements involved multi-resistance, were determined. The origin of this E. coli population was also investigated. This monitoring demonstrated that multi-antibiotic- resistant E. coli, representing 23 % of the total population, infiltrated the karst aquifer at the peak of a rainfall event, with some isolates being resistant to up to eight antibiotics. No intI 1 gene was detected. The search for the origin of the resistant E. coli isolated during this rainfall event demonstrated that they were of both animal and human origin.
