5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December <b>solstice</b> {{position}} (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December <b>solstice,</b> the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December <b>solstice</b> position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December <b>solstice</b> fell on 21 December.|$|E

5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer <b>solstice,</b> the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter <b>solstice,</b> it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

50|$|The {{precession}} of <b>solstices</b> and equinoxes is {{the third}} factor that {{plays a role in}} Earth climate change that deals directly with the earth itself. The basis of the precession of <b>solstices</b> and equinoxes is that it causes the seasons to occur at different times in Earth’s revolution around the sun throughout a cycle recurring about every 23,000 years.|$|R

5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each <b>solstice.</b> The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer <b>solstice,</b> when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E
5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter <b>solstice</b> currently occurs around 21 December; summer <b>solstice</b> is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer <b>solstice</b> a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter <b>solstice</b> two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer <b>solstice,</b> winter <b>solstice,</b> equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer <b>solstice,</b> when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter <b>solstice,</b> when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June <b>solstice</b> between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the <b>solstice</b> Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|The temple is D-shaped, and its {{alignment}} is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. Its {{location and}} orientation indicate that its builders understood {{the cycles of}} both {{the sun and the}} moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter <b>solstice,</b> which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform {{at the south end of}} Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter <b>solstice.</b> Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.|$|E

5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer <b>solstice</b> and one at the summer <b>solstice,</b> which has a double sunset.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter <b>solstice,</b> but at the summer <b>solstice</b> it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side {{relative}} to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the solstices. This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth's poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices, so Ariel's poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each <b>solstice.</b> The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer <b>solstice,</b> when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. A number of such events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.|$|E
