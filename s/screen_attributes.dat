40|$|IntroductionStated-preference methods {{provide a}} {{systematic}} approach to quantitatively assess the relative preferences for features of cancer screening tests. We reviewed stated-preference studies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening {{to identify the}} types of attributes included, the use of questions to assess uptake, and whether gaps exist in these areas. The goal of our review is to inform research on the design and promotion of public health programs to increase cancer screening. MethodsUsing the PubMed and EconLit databases, we identified studies published in English from January 1990 through July 2013 that measured preferences for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer <b>screening</b> test <b>attributes</b> using conjoint analysis or a discrete-choice experiment. We extracted data on study characteristics and results. We categorized studies by whether <b>attributes</b> evaluated included <b>screening</b> test, health care delivery characteristics, or both. ResultsTwenty-two studies met the search criteria. Colorectal cancer was the most commonly studied cancer of the 3. Fifteen studies examined only <b>screening</b> test <b>attributes</b> (efficacy, process, test characteristics, and cost). Two studies included only health care delivery attributes (information provided, staff characteristics, waiting time, and distance to facility). Five studies examined both screening test and health care delivery <b>attributes.</b> Overall, cancer <b>screening</b> test <b>attributes</b> {{had a significant effect}} on a patient 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s selection of a cancer screening test, and health care delivery attributes had mixed effects on choice. ConclusionA growing number of studies examine preferences for cancer screening tests. These studies consistently find that <b>screening</b> test <b>attributes,</b> such as efficacy, process, and cost, are significant determinants of choice. Fewer studies have examined the effect of health care delivery attributes on choice, and the results from these studies are mixed. There is a need for additional studies on the barriers to cancer screening uptake, including health care delivery attributes, and the effect of education materials on preferences. 26916898 PMC 476887...|$|R

Its aims are to investigate: (1) the evaluative dimensions used when assessing proposals, (2) how these criteria relate to screening decisions and (3) how new product environments [...] market, product and firm [...] affect this decision model. A two stage research approach involved: (1) {{the establishment of}} new product <b>screening</b> <b>attributes</b> relevant to {{industrial product}} firms and (2) a reassessment by managers of recently screened new product ideas (accepts and rejects) in terms of these attributes. Managers' new product screening decisions supported the hypothesized decision model. Nine of the eleven composite dimensions characterizing new industrial products, were key determinants in explaining screening decisions. These dimensions were further classified according to: (1) four basic criteria categories, (2) the basic risk/return investment model and (3) the screening role played by each. Moreover, the project environment, particularly its market, had a significant influence on the screening model. The results have implications for developing operationally more effective screening approaches...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} behavioural changes {{brought about by}} two interventions introduced to lower the incidence of cervical cancer in Australia. The first intervention is a media campaign promoting regular screening behaviour to women. The second intervention is a vaccination program providing a free HPV vaccine, Gardasil, to young women launched in the same period. The results using data from discrete choice experiments find that in general, given individual characteristics, the interventions have minor impact on how women value <b>screening</b> <b>attributes.</b> The interventions however alter women?s inherent taste for screening. Unexpectedly, willingness to screen is generally lower post-interventions. The reason for this trend appears {{to be related to}} HPV events. For instance, the reduction in screening participation is particularly marked among young women who are eligible for the vaccination program. There is also a larger aversion towards testing among women who gained information on HPV facts and HPV-related measures. Thus, in the face of HPV innovations, screening promotions need to account for these factors. A simulation exercise is then performed to assess the plausibility of several strategies to increase the screening rate. The results nominate supply-side policies, in particular those targeted to health providers, as the most effective strategy. cervical screening, HPV Vaccine, preferences, discrete choice experiment, Australia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesColorectal cancer (CRC) {{screening}} uptake remains poor. Until {{we understand}} patient motivation and preferences for undertaking screening, {{it is unlikely}} the uptake will be optimal. Our objective is to examine patient preferences for CRC screening modalities and uptake rates using utility-based methods. MethodsThe preference survey was mailed to {{a random sample of}} Canadian subjects aged 40 to 60 years from a primary care network. A fractional factorial experimental design maximized D-efficiency and included four blocks with 12 choice tasks in a conditional two-step design, two-alternative discrete choice format with five <b>screening</b> <b>attributes</b> (process, pain, preparation, sensitivity, and specificity). Bivariate probit regression analysis was used to estimate patient preferences for attributes, choice probabilities for alternative modalities and expected rates of uptake. ResultsFive hundred forty-seven of 1047 surveys were returned. Almost 30 % of respondents preferred no screening. The most preferred test attribute levels were noninvasiveprocess (e. g., CT), no preparation, no pain, 100 % specificity, and 90 % sensitivity. Accuracy-related attributes were more important than test process-related attributes. Virtual colonoscopy was the most preferred, followed by colonoscopy, barium enema, sigmoidoscopy, and fecal DNA testing, based on simulated choice probability estimates. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) was least preferred. Adjusted screening uptake rate estimates showed the greatest impact (42 % increase) would be achieved if all CRC screening modalities were available rather than FOBT alone. ConclusionOur findings emphasize the important role of patient preferences for no screening and in selecting alternative CRC screening modalities. CRC screening implementation in Canada should consider patient preferences to optimize uptake...|$|R

40|$|Healthy {{behaviours}} {{are important}} determinants {{of health and}} disease, but many people {{find it difficult to}} perform these behaviours. Systematic reviews support the use of personal financial incentives to encourage healthy behaviours. There is concern that financial incentives may be unacceptable to the public, those delivering services and policymakers, but this has been poorly studied. Without widespread acceptability, financial incentives are unlikely to be widely implemented. We sought to answer two questions: what are the relative preferences of UK adults for attributes of financial incentives for healthy behaviours? Do preferences vary according to the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics?We conducted an online discrete choice experiment. Participants were adult members of a market research panel living in the UK selected using quota sampling. Preferences were examined for financial incentives for: smoking cessation, regular physical activity, attendance for vaccination, and attendance for <b>screening.</b> <b>Attributes</b> of interest (and their levels) were: type of incentive (none, cash, shopping vouchers or lottery tickets); value of incentive (a continuous variable); schedule of incentive (same value each week, or value increases as behaviour change is sustained); other information provided (none, written information, face-to-face discussion, or both); and recipients (all eligible individuals, people living in low-income households, or pregnant women). Cash or shopping voucher incentives were preferred as much as, or more than, no incentive in all cases. Lower value incentives and those offered to all eligible individuals were preferred. Preferences for additional information provided alongside incentives varied between behaviours. Younger participants and men were more likely to prefer incentives. There were no clear differences in preference according to educational attainment. Cash or shopping voucher-type financial incentives for healthy behaviours are not necessarily less acceptable than no incentives to UK adults...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three independent essays evaluating the impact of public health interventions in two countries, Indonesia and Australia. The first two essays concern the national pro-poor health card program in Indonesia, which fully subsidises health care purchases by its recipients. In quantifying {{the impact of the}} program, the combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences techniques is used to address bias due to non-random assignment. Covariates to match include both variables affecting demand and eligibility and variables measuring local health care supply. Using data from the single, nationally-representative longitudinal study of Indonesian households, the program is found to have limited impact. The second essay evaluates the program&# 146;s impact on supply variables. In the absence of a wage revision or additional staff, the program lowers the incentives for health workers to maintain their public position. This is particularly true for those workers providing outpatient care as patients can not be controlled by waiting lists. The analysis finds some evidence of reduced number of full-time doctors in areas where the distribution of health cards were most extensive. The final essay uses Australian data to investigate changes in women&# 146;s preferences for cervical screening following a screening promotion campaign and a vaccination program. Discrete choice experiments were used to elicit preferences, and results from experiments conducted prior and after the interventions were compared. Several additional comparison groups were created based on spatial variations and by variation induced by randomisation. The study finds that the interventions have minor impact on how women valued various <b>screening</b> <b>attributes.</b> However, there was a general reduction in the willingness to screen, which was unexpected given the awareness campaign. Through simulation, it is shown that an effective way to increase the screening rate is through encouraging a more active role of the provider...|$|R

40|$|We study a slow {{relaxation}} {{process in a}} frustrated spin system in which a kind of screening effect due to frustrated environment plays an important role. This <b>screening</b> is <b>attributed</b> to highly degenerate configurations of the frustrated environment. This slow relaxation appears due to an entropy effect and is different from those due to energy barrier observed in systems such as random ferromagnets. In the present system, {{even if there is}} no energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this phenomenon “entropic slowing down”. Here, we study mechanism of the entropic slowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated bonds. The spins included in the decorated bonds (decoration spins) cause peculiar density of states, which causes the entropy-originated screening effect.
