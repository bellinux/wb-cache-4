5|$|On October 7, Baldwin {{addressed}} the John Birch Society {{on the second}} day of its 50th anniversary. At the event he discussed the role of Christianity in the United States public life and delivered his <b>stump</b> <b>speech.</b> He attacked globalist entities such as NAFTA, the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty and the Security and Prosperity Partnership as well as calling for the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{town hall}} events include the 1858 debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. [...] Since then, presidential town hall {{meetings}} have become nearly as common as <b>stump</b> <b>speeches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stump</b> <b>speeches</b> are {{not meant}} to {{generate}} news, outside of local media covering a candidate's appearance. National media usually ignore their contents in their daily news coverage. The predictability of <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> gives reporters a general indication that the candidate will soon conclude their speech. An example of this comes from Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller, who would constantly use the phrase [...] "the brotherhood of man, under the fatherhood of God" [...] {{toward the end of his}} speeches during his multiple bids for the Republican Party presidential nomination. Reporters covering Rockefeller came to abbreviate the expression as BOMFOG.|$|R
50|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} in the community in 1868. It was named in honor of a series of popular <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> given at the crossroads during the 1850s by local politician James Greene Hardy, Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky from 1855 to 1856.|$|R
25|$|Olson last made {{a public}} {{appearance}} on June 29, 1936, giving a <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> in Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis. The next day, {{he returned to}} the Mayo Clinic for treatment, but it was too late. He died there on August 22. He was 44 years old.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{minstrel}} performance {{followed a}} three-act structure. The troupe first danced onto stage then exchanged wisecracks and sang songs. The second part featured {{a variety of}} entertainments, including the pun-filled <b>stump</b> <b>speech.</b> The final act consisted of a slapstick musical plantation skit or a send-up of a popular play.|$|E
25|$|Following {{allegations}} of plagiarism Patrick {{came to the}} defense of presidential candidate Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries, when it was reported that some key phrases from an Obama <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> were very similar to words used during Patrick's own 2006 gubernatorial run. The charges were largely dismissed, after Patrick explained that he had encouraged their use.|$|E
50|$|MacDonald's story {{reported}} that the move let the president avoid Maine and District of Columbia taxes. MacDonald's story help {{form the basis of}} Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> and for editorials and political cartoons nationwide, including Doonesbury by turning the issue to Clintonâ€™s advantage.|$|R
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} second place {{showing in the}} Delaware primary on April 24, and with a {{campaign}} debt in excess of $4 million, Gingrich suspended his campaign and endorsed front-runner Mitt Romney on May 2, 2012, on whose behalf he subsequently campaigned (i.e. <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> and television appearances).|$|R
50|$|Ahead of the West Virginia vote, Obama {{took the}} lead in {{committed}} superdelegates on May 9. Obama had picked up seven endorsements from superdelegates since the May 6 primaries. Recognizing that the nature of the contest had changed, Clinton largely eliminated mention or criticism of Obama from her <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> and advertisements.|$|R
25|$|Joe Biden's {{campaign}} also {{ended in}} controversy after the Delaware Senator {{was accused of}} plagiarizing a speech by Neil Kinnock, then-leader of the British Labour Party. The Dukakis campaign secretly released a video in which Biden was filmed repeating a <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> by Kinnock, with only minor modifications. This ultimately led him {{to drop out of}} the race. Dukakis later revealed that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned. The Delaware Supreme Court's Board on Professional Responsibility would later clear Biden of the law school plagiarism charges.|$|E
25|$|With the Panic of 1837, theater {{attendance}} suffered, {{and concerts}} {{were one of}} the few attractions that could still make money. In 1843, four blackface performers led by Dan Emmett combined to stage just such a concert at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre, calling themselves the Virginia Minstrels. The minstrel show as a complete evening's entertainment was born. The show had little structure. The four sat in a semicircle, played songs, and traded wisecracks. One gave a <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> in dialect, and they ended with a lively plantation song. The term minstrel had previously been reserved for traveling white singing groups, but Emmett and company made it synonymous with blackface performance, and by using it, signalled that they were reaching out to a new, middle-class audience.|$|E
25|$|The second {{portion of}} the show, called the olio, was {{historically}} the last to evolve, as its real purpose was {{to allow for the}} setting of the stage for act three behind the curtain. It had more of a variety show structure. Performers danced, played instruments, did acrobatics, and demonstrated other amusing talents. Troupes offered parodies of European-style entertainments, and European troupes themselves sometimes performed. The highlight was when one actor, typically one of the endmen, delivered a faux-black-dialect <b>stump</b> <b>speech,</b> a long oration about anything from nonsense to science, society, or politics, during which the dim-witted character tried to speak eloquently, only to deliver countless malapropisms, jokes, and unintentional puns. All the while, the speaker moved about like a clown, standing on his head and almost always falling off his stump at some point. With blackface makeup serving as fool's mask, these stump speakers could deliver biting social criticism without offending the audience, although the focus was usually on sending up unpopular issues and making fun of blacks' ability to make sense of them. Many troupes employed a stump specialist with a trademark style and material.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it true {{that all}} has been settled satisfactorily?" [...] asked Harry, presently, and when I answered, he added: [...] "Then we're going back to finish the evening. Johnston's to honor the company with <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> {{and all kinds of}} banjo eccentricities. You are getting too sober and serious, Ralph; come along." ...|$|R
2500|$|Diamond's act also {{incorporated}} singing, {{either by}} a partner or by Diamond himself. When partnered with a banjoist, Diamond danced and leapt about the stage while the musician played. These acts involved precise choreography. His repertoire consisted of popular blackface numbers, such as [...] "Jim-a-Long-Josey". He performed <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> as well, {{such as his}} [...] "Negro speech in Congress".|$|R
50|$|Kennedy visited {{numerous}} {{small towns}} and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner <b>stump</b> <b>speeches,</b> often in troubled inner cities. He made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of Appalachia.|$|R
500|$|Harding's [...] {{campaign}}ing style aided him; one Harding friend {{deemed the}} candidate's <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> during the 1914 fall campaign as [...] "a rambling, high-sounding mixture of platitudes, patriotism, and pure nonsense". Dean notes, [...] "Harding used his oratory to good effect; it got him elected, making as few enemies {{as possible in}} the process." [...] Harding won by over 100,000 votes in a landslide that also swept into office a Republican governor, Frank B. Willis.|$|E
500|$|The {{year after}} their marriage, the couple began {{campaign}}ing for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy. According to George Bush, {{when he asked}} her to marry him, she had said, [...] "Yes. But only if you promise me that I'll never have to make a campaign speech." [...] She soon relented, and gave her first <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe, Texas. After narrowly winning the primary, he lost the general election.|$|E
500|$|Rahm Emanuel {{worked for}} the Daley {{campaign}} as a fundraiser, David Axelrod as campaign strategist, William Daley as chief strategist, and Forrest Claypool as a campaign aide. Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of Polish Highlanders at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, [...] "You want a white mayor {{to sit down with}} everybody." [...] Sawyer said he was [...] "shocked." [...] Daley explained, [...] "It was my standard <b>stump</b> <b>speech.</b> I'm not maybe the best speaker in town, but I have never used the word [...]" [...] That Friday, the campaign watchdog group CONDUCT censured Daley and commended Sawyer for his [...] "rejection of racially inflammatory comments." ...|$|E
5000|$|Diamond's act also {{incorporated}} singing, {{either by}} a partner or by Diamond himself. When partnered with a banjoist, Diamond danced and leapt about the stage while the musician played. These acts involved precise choreography. His repertoire consisted of popular blackface numbers, such as [...] "Jim-a-Long-Josey". He performed <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> as well, {{such as his}} [...] "Negro speech in Congress".|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the American Civil War, women's {{rights was}} a popular target of the <b>stump</b> <b>speech's</b> ridicule. The women's rights lecture became a {{standard}} part of the repertoire for many troupes, who joked about women being interested in [...] "polytick" [...] only because [...] "de majority ob em am strongly tached to parties." [...] Another speech claimed that ...|$|R
50|$|On Labor Day each year, Pocahontas {{is home to}} the Coal Miners Reunion, {{which brings}} {{together}} retired coal miners and railroad workers from across the United States to be honored by the town with a parade and luncheon. The festival also includes special recognition of the oldest and longest-serving miners or railroad workers present and <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> from local political candidates.|$|R
500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth/If you let me inside your world,' he sings. The <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign. Will wrote that if [...] "labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products {{with as much}} energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, {{there would be no}} need for Congress to be thinking about protectionism". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A." [...] by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents.|$|E
500|$|The Obama {{campaign}} nevertheless still valued Biden as a retail-level {{politician who}} could connect with disaffected, blue collar workers and rural residents, {{and he had}} a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the Obama re-election campaign began in earnest in spring 2012. [...] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that proposed Republican relaxation of Wall Street regulations would [...] "put y'all back in chains" [...] led to a similar analysis of Biden's face-to-face campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track. [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Most candidates give the same <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> over and over, putting reporters if not the audience to sleep. But during any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion." [...] Time magazine wrote that Biden often goes too far and that [...] "Along with the familiar Washington mix of neediness and overconfidence, Biden's brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{story is}} {{frequently}} recalled during Obama's <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> on how [...] "one voice can change a room." [...] The {{woman in the}} story, Councilwoman Edith S. Childs, appeared later with Obama {{at a rally in}} South Carolina. She later told reporters that if he were to win the presidency, that she would want one thing: [...] "I want an invitation to an inaugural ball!" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1922, the Democratic Party {{nominated}} former {{party leader}} Austin Peay to oppose Taylor for governor. Peay lacked the charisma of Taylor, and resorted to delivering basic <b>stump</b> <b>speeches,</b> {{in contrast to}} Taylor's entertaining rallies. Peay {{had the support of}} entrepreneur Clarence Saunders (the founder of Piggly Wiggly), and with the Democratic Party once again unified, he defeated Taylor on election day, 141,002 votes to 102,586.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> were send-ups {{of science}} or {{philosophy}} that parodied the lyceum lectures {{popular with the}} educated middle class in the 1850s. [...] One example was Billy Whitlock's [...] "Locomotive Lecture", a comical look at the steam engine. Others satirized political and social issues such as abolitionism or public education. For example, Frank Brower of the Virginia Minstrels delivered a [...] "Definition of the Bankrupt Laws".|$|R
2500|$|Edwards' <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> {{spoke of}} [...] "Two Americas", with one {{composed}} of the wealthy and privileged, and the other of the hard-working common man, causing the media to often characterize Edwards as a populist.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major factor}} in the primary {{campaign}} was DeWine's marriage. In 2004, DeWine's opponent ran ads calling attention to DeWine leaving his pregnant wife and their two children for a mistress working as a lobbyist. Schmidt made it a point in her <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> to emphasize how long she had been married to her husband: [...] "I am a woman of character who has been married for twenty-nine years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Wellstone {{formed an}} {{exploratory}} committee and a leadership PAC, the Progressive Politics Network, that {{paid for his}} travels to Iowa and New Hampshire, two early primary states in the nomination process. He spoke before organized labor and local Democrats, using the slogan, [...] "I represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party". Governor Howard Dean later incorporated that phrase into his <b>stump</b> <b>speech</b> in the 2004 US presidential election.|$|E
5000|$|This {{story is}} {{frequently}} recalled during Obama's <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> on how [...] "one voice can change a room." [...] The {{woman in the}} story, Councilwoman Edith S.

500|$|In {{a speech}} {{given at the}} town's Fourth of July celebration, Rigdon {{declared}} that Mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the Missourians and spoke of a [...] "war of extermination" [...] if Mormons were attacked. Smith implicitly endorsed this speech, and many non-Mormons understood {{it to be a}} thinly-veiled threat. They unleashed a flood of anti-Mormon rhetoric in newspapers and in <b>stump</b> <b>speeches</b> given during the 1838 election campaign.|$|R
50|$|In the 1932 campaign, LeBlanc {{spent more}} time attacking Long, {{who was not a}} {{candidate}} for reelection, than he did his principal rival, Oscar Allen. Long retaliated: in <b>stump</b> <b>speeches,</b> he poked fun at LeBlanc's French name, much as Long's brother, Earl Kemp Long, later ridiculed then New Orleans Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison in the 1955 gubernatorial primary. Long also criticized LeBlanc's funeral business, which catered primarily to African Americans.|$|R
