5000|$|The Roman Empire had {{an immense}} {{impact on the}} {{development}} of viticulture and oenology. Wine {{was an integral part of}} the Roman diet and winemaking became a precise business. Virtually all of the major wine-producing regions of Western Europe today were established during the Roman Imperial era. During the Roman Empire, social norms began to shift as the production of alcohol increases. Further evidence suggests that widespread drunkenness and true alcoholism among the Romans began in the first century BC and reached its height in the first century AD. Viniculture expanded so much that by AD [...] the emperor Domitian was forced to pass the first wine laws on record, banning the planting of any new vinyards in Italy and uprooting half of the vinyards in the provinces in order to increase the production of the necessary but less profitable grain. (The measure was widely ignored but remained on the books until its 280 repeal by Probus.Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire. Vitruvius noted how wine storage rooms were specially built facing north, [...] "since that quarter is never subject to change but is always constant and unshifting", and special smokehouses (fumaria) were developed to speed or mimic aging. Many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were developed. Barrels (invented by the Gauls) and glass bottles (invented by the Syrians) began to compete with terracotta amphoras for storing and shipping wine. Following the Greek invention of the <b>screw,</b> <b>wine</b> <b>presses</b> became common in Roman villas. The Romans also created a precursor to today's appellation systems, as certain regions gained reputations for their fine wines. The most famous was the white Falernian from the Latian-Campanian border, principally because of its high (~15%) alcohol content. The Romans recognized three appellations: Caucinian Falernian from the highest slopes, Faustian Falernian from the center (named for its one-time owner Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the dictator), and generic Falernian from the lower slopes and plain. The esteemed vintages grew in value as they aged, and each region produced different varieties as well: dry, sweet, and light. Other famous wines were the sweet Alban from the Alban Hills and the Caecuban beloved by Horace and extirpated by Nero. Pliny cautioned that such 'first-growth' wines not be smoked in a fumarium like lesser vintages.|$|R

This work first investigates how factors like age, gender, income and education affect {{the decision to}} purchase <b>screw</b> cap <b>wines</b> {{and to what extent}} these factors impact consumer decisions to bring <b>screw</b> cap <b>wine</b> to various social settings. The results of a questionnaire pooling attitudes and behaviors of wine purchasers (n= 319) indicate that factors such as age, wine knowledge, income and gender influence a consumer’s decision to purchase <b>screw</b> cap <b>wine.</b> Education and income positively impact the acceptance of <b>screw</b> cap <b>wines</b> and the likelihood of purchasing them. Age has a negative effect on acceptance of <b>screw</b> cap <b>wines</b> in social situations. Gender was found to not be significant in regards to likelihood of <b>screw</b> cap <b>wine</b> purchase generally, however men tended to view <b>screw</b> cap <b>wines</b> as more acceptable in more social situations than women...|$|R

The earliest <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> was probably the human foot or hand, crushing and squeezing grapes into a bag or container where the contents would ferment.|$|R

25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} <b>wine</b> <b>presses</b> that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|R
