5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

25|$|The {{team had}} been known informally as the Blue Bulls since the 1940s and from 8 June 1963 in a {{newspaper}} cartoon by Victor Ivanoff had been portrayed as such. Their name officially changed to the Blue Bulls {{at the end of}} 1997 season and in 1998 after 6 years of not reaching the final and some very heavy defeats at Currie Cup level, the Bulls, captained by another legend, Joost van der Westhuizen, managed to reach the final for a record 24th time after the come-back of the century in the semi-final against a star-studded Sharks outfit. The Bulls' triumph was nothing short of remarkable. After André Joubert's second try early in the second half, which stretched the Sharks' lead from 10-3 to 17-3, even their coach, Eugene van Wyk, believed that they had no chance. But whatever Bulls captain Van der Westhuizen told his team while Gavin Lawless was setting up for the conversion of Joubert's second try, it made them realise that it was now or never. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>they</b> started playing with new life and new direction. Franco Smith scored a couple of penalties and then prop Piet Boer dived over for a try. The last 12 minutes with the score on 17-all, were dramatic. First, flanker Nicky van der Walt put the Bulls ahead with a magnificent try following Van der Westhuizen's brilliant opportunistic play and great ball skills. And the last nail went into the Sharks coffin when the Bulls were awarded a penalty try for an early tackle by André Joubert on Grant Esterhuizen in the in-goal area. The following Saturday they defeated Western Province 24-20 at Loftus. With only a few minutes left on the clock, Province must have thought they won it when their Springbok-winger Chester Williams went over in the corner, but referee André Watson ruled the pass from Robbie Fleck forward.|$|E
25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>they</b> hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Deewaar (1975), which Boyle {{described}} as being [...] "absolutely key to Indian cinema", is a crime film based on the Bombay gangster Haji Mastan, portrayed by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, whose autograph Jamal seeks {{at the beginning of}} Slumdog Millionaire. Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of the film [...] "are like Deewaar, the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money." [...] Boyle has cited other Indian films as influences in later interviews. The rags-to-riches, underdog theme was also a recurring theme in classic Bollywood movies from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when [...] "India worked to lift itself from hunger and poverty."

2500|$|In March 1972 Alison MacCallum issued {{her first}} solo single, [...] "Superman", [...] on RCA Records {{which was written}} by Harry Vanda and George Young (both ex-The Easybeats).

Also that month she released her debut solo album, Fresh Water, a reference to her former band. It was produced by United Kingdom producer Simon Napier-Bell, {{who had worked with}} The Yardbirds and T.Rex. John Tait described Napier-Bell's work as re-invigorating Vanda & Young's songwriting career [...] "Ted Albert assigned him the task of finding artists to record some of the songs Harry and George were sending over from London. The most notable of these demos was a rock tune called 'Superman' ... matched the song up with the soaring voice of session singer Alison MacCallum, added some brass to the original arrangement and <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> had a hit on their hands". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted Fresh Waters [...] "mix of rock, jazz and blues material proved to be a fine showcase for her expressive voice". In March 1974 it was re-released as, Any Way You Want Me.|$|E

[...] There is no one to stop the flood {{and put an end}} to this despicable and dangerous tendency. [...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts.

2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea.

She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well.

[...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised.

2500|$|Crook soon {{turned his}} efforts to dislodging Chief American Horse and his family in the ravine. [...] The {{defenders}} had already killed Private John Wenzel, wounded others and threatened all that approached. [...] The deaths and injuries of their comrades inflamed the soldiers who were already distraught from their ordeal. [...] Trees and brush obstructed {{the view of the}} interior of the winding dry gully and the narrowness kept the soldiers from firing accurately. [...] Some of the scouts and packers joined in an informal attempt to roust the Indians but met with unexpected firepower and fell back in surprise. [...] "Crook then deployed troops below the mouth of the ravine, crawling on their bellies, firing at random into the hidden ravine without evident harm to the warriors. Before along a multitude of soldiers had gathered near the cavelike mouth of the ditch, somewhat protected from gunfire by sharp embankment. [...] Officers and men joined sending a fusillade into its black depths, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> received a veritable volley in response that sent them reeling and stumbling away." [...] Then, on Crook’s orders, First Lieutenant William Philo Clark led a group of twenty volunteers forth, but the Indians sent forth such overwhelming volleys that the troops scampered for safety. [...] Some of the men crept forward with flaming sticks which they tossed into the ditch without apparent effect. [...] By now hundreds of idlers had gathered {{in the vicinity of the}} ravine and they complicated the efforts. [...] "It was a wonder to me," [...] recalled Major John G. Bourke, [...] "that the shots of the beleaguered did not kill them by the half-dozen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{also took}} part—illegally—in {{lobbying}} for the statehood bill, {{working closely with}} the Alaska Statehood Committee from his office at Interior. Stevens hired Margaret Atwood, daughter of Anchorage Times publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department. [...] "We were violating the law," [...] Stevens told a researcher in an October 1977 oral history interview for the Eisenhower Library. [...] "e were lobbying from the executive branch, and there's been a statute against that for a long time.... We more or less, I would say, masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch." [...] Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on members of Congress based on [...] "whether they were Rotarians or Kiwanians or Catholics or Baptists and veterans or loggers, the whole thing," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "And we'd assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that had something in common with them." [...] The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. [...] "We set Ike up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try to ask him about statehood." [...] Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens. [...] "We planted editorials in weeklies and dailies and newspapers in the district of people we thought were opposed to us or states where they were opposed to us so that <b>suddenly</b> <b>they</b> were thinking twice about opposing us." ...|$|E
