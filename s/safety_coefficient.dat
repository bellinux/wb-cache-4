In a long-term perspective, the development now goes towards an analytical design, directly based on a natural fire exposure and specified with respect to the combustion characteristics of the fire load and the geometrical,ventilation, and thermal properties of the fire compartment.

In this paper, the strength reserve factor (SRF) method is adopted to simulate gradual failure and possible unstable modes of RCCD system. The entropy theory and catastrophe theory are used to obtain the ultimate bearing resistance and failure criterion of the RCCD. The most dangerous sliding plane for RCCD failure is found using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and auxiliary analysis of partial least squares regression (PLSR).

40|$|This PhD thesis {{demonstrates}} a reliability analysis methodology {{to solve the}} safety issues existing in the current structural design of fabric structures: The <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> proposed by different countries and academic institutes are not consistent, and the leading structural safeties are obscure and require a justification. A reliability tool specific for fabric structures is developed to estimate the structural safety and justify the <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> for structural design based on the variations of the design variables like loads, material strength. The research work includes three main parts: the first one aims at a finite element formulation proposed for a highly accurate and efficient deterministic analysis. Four element types have been compared and discussed, and the linear strain triangle coupled with Dynamic Relaxation algorithm are shown to be most efficient with the satisfactory accuracy, The second part is focus on a probabilistic methodology to identify and analyze the material uncertainties based on the experiment data. The probabilistic models to qualify the variation in the fabric strength and Young’s modulus under uniaxial tension are demonstrated, and a practical algorithm to determine best data-fit distributions is also presented. The third part is the reliability formulation which consists of first order reliability method(FORM) and the finite element method based on the six node linear strain triangles. The analytical method with the principle of chain rule is applied in deriving the gradients of the limit state functions. The sensitivities of the structural safety corresponding to different uncertainties are compared and analyzed through numerical examples. Finally a case study based a realistic design example is undertaken, and safety factors for loads, materials, and other design elements are justified and discussed. This thesis demonstrates that the <b>safety</b> <b>coefficients</b> currently used in the fabric structure design may not be either economic or safe. Based on the uncertainty information of the design elements, the appropriate safety factors required for the structural safety standards can be evaluated using the reliability tool, and then an optimized design decision in consideration of safety and cost can be subsequently determined.

Development of methods for accelerated hygienic-toxicological evaluation of harmful substances, especially of their basic toxicometric parameters, has acquired great importance for preventing chemical pollution of the environment. It has been demonstrated by previous investigations carried out within the framework of cooperation by Soviet and American scientists, that with continuous inhalation of chemical compounds the concentration-time dependence for the appearance of acute effects and physiological and biochemical shifts can be represented by a straight line on a logarithmic scale grid (I). The expression of the ''concentration-time " dependence, log T = log To- tan a * log C, indicates that the position of the straight-line curve determines the To parameter (time of occurrence of the effect from exposure to a certain concentration), while the tangent of the angle of incidence (tan a) determines its course on the logarithmic grid. Thus, the curve of the time of occurrence of a certain effect dependent on concentration can be regarded as a regression line of the effect of time on concentration. Moreover, the tangent of the angle of incidence of the curve is the coefficient of regression and indicates the number of times by which the logarithm of the time of occurrence of the effect is increased upon reducing the logarithm of concentration to one...|$|R
