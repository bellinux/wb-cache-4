25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> <b>are</b> offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
25|$|Registered Nurse: Some jurisdictions use {{specially}} trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized {{training and experience}} in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), basic life support (BLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), neonatal resuscitation program (NRP), trauma nursing core course (TNCC), and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), in addition to Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Critical Care Nursing (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or Flight Nursing (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate {{at or above the}} level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics {{for a period of time}} as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit. Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in <b>some</b> <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required to, but it is not the standard of practice.|$|E

2500|$|Road {{departments}} and private industry may apply liquid or powdered magnesium chloride to control dust and erosion on unimproved (dirt or gravel) roads and dusty job {{sites such as}} quarries because it is relatively inexpensive to purchase and apply. Its hygroscopy makes it absorb moisture from the air, {{limiting the number of}} smaller particles (silts and clays) that become airborne. The most significant benefit of applying dust control products is the reduction in gravel road maintenance costs. However, recent research and updates indicate biological toxicity in the environment in plants as an ongoing problem. [...] Since 2001, truckers have complained about [...] "Killer Chemicals" [...] on roads and now <b>some</b> <b>states</b> <b>are</b> backing away from using salt products.|$|E
6000|$|Before yet any woodchuck or {{squirrel}} had {{run across}} the road, or the sun had got above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the farmers warned me against it--I would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on--I began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand, but {{later in the day}} the sun blistered my feet. There the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout. Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grass--this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic result. A very agricola laboriosus was I to travellers bound westward through Lincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at their ease in gigs, with elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in festoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only open and cultivated field for a great distance {{on either side of the}} road, so they made the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers' gossip and comment than was meant for his ear: [...] "Beans so late! peas so late!"--for I continued to plant when others had begun to hoe--the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it. [...] "Corn, my boy, for fodder; corn for fodder." [...] "Does he live there?" [...] asks the black bonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste stuff, or it may be ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a half of furrows, and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw it--there being an aversion to other carts and horses--and chip dirt far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in the agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman's report. And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of English hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond-holes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as <b>some</b> <b>states</b> <b>are</b> civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my hoe played the Ranz des Vaches for them.|$|E
