500|$|In {{conjunction}} with overseeing the directing process, Soderbergh {{functioned as a}} cinematographer for Contagion. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED One MX digital camera, which uses ambient light and has a 4.5K image resolution. Since he hoped for the premise to be authentic and [...] "as realistic as possible", Soderbergh opted not to film in the studio. [...] "There's, to me, nothing more satisfying occasionally than making someplace look like <b>someplace</b> <b>else</b> on film and having nobody know the difference." [...] For choosing cities, Soderbergh felt that they couldn't [...] "go anywhere where one of our characters hasn't been", since he wanted to portray an [...] "epic", yet [...] "intimate" [...] scenario. He explained, ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Turner's book [...] {{describes}} the Movementarians as {{a cross between}} the Church of Scientology and Raëlism, with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Planet Simpson also notes the Simpsons' chant {{at the conclusion of}} the episode as evidence of a [...] "true high-growth quasi-religious cult of our time", referring to television. The book refers to a [...] "Cult of Pop", which it describes as [...] "a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West's social fabric where organized religion used to be". Martin Hunt of FACTnet notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology. [...] "The Leader" [...] physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard; the Movementarians' [...] "trillion year labor contract" [...] alludes to the (Scientology) Sea Org's billion year contract; and both groups make extensive use of litigation. The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called [...] "Springfield joins a cult", comparing the Movementarians' plans to travel to [...] "Blisstonia" [...] to Heaven's Gate's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Hale–Bopp. However, it also notes that [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] is a commentary on organized religion in general, quoting Bart as saying, [...] "Church, cult, cult, church. So we get bored <b>someplace</b> <b>else</b> every Sunday." [...] Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons approach to deprogramming in the episode, noting groundskeeper Willie's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to deprogram Homer. Author Chris Turner suggests that Marge should have instead gone with the [...] "Conformco Brain Deprogrammers" [...] used in the episode [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] to convince Bart to leave Mr. Burns and come back home.|$|E
2500|$|Forty Acres – This {{historically}} Irish neighborhood, rural {{until the}} mid-19th century, {{developed from the}} farmland of Joshua T. Heald.

2500|$|In many immigrants' {{countries}} of origin, {{education is not}} free. Children therefore rely on their parents for the fees necessary to obtain an education. [...] In some cases, this means that children are unable to complete their education because their parents are unable to pay the school fees or would rather invest that money <b>someplace</b> <b>else,</b> perhaps in another child's education. Girls, in particular, may be unlikely to complete their education because of many cultures' preference for boys. After immigrating to the United States, all children have access to free education through high school, and can apply for scholarships to help fund a college education as well. While parental contributions are still important, {{especially in the case}} of college tuition, this removes many of the barriers to educational achievement and also means that parents no longer have as much control over their children's access to educational opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|In 1501, Babur laid siege to Samarkand once more, but {{was soon}} {{defeated}} by his most formidable rival, Muhammad Shaybani, Khan of the Uzbeks. Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping {{with a small}} band of followers, he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants. He finally stayed in Tashkent, which was ruled by his maternal uncle. Babur wrote, [...] "During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!" [...] For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of Badakhshan in particular. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck <b>someplace</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
