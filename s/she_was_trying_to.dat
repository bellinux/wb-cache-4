5|$|Casting Andy {{was less}} clear-cut. Fox wanted an A-list younger actress, and felt Rachel McAdams, then coming off successes in The Notebook and Mean Girls, {{would help the}} film's {{commercial}} prospects. However, she declined several offers to play Andy, telling the studio <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid mainstream projects for a while.|$|E
5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album. She {{believed that the}} most important thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where she lay dying of cancer. She claimed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> preserve some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending {{at the time of}} Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.|$|E

5|$|Pre-Madonna is a {{collection}} of demos by American singer Madonna. The album was released in 1997 by Stephen Bray, who was the producer of the songs when they were recorded, and was distributed by Soultone. It was released as In the Beginning in European countries. Madonna met up with Bray, her former boyfriend, in 1980 when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> establish her music career. She had left the band Breakfast Club and enlisted Bray's help to further her career. Together they started writing songs and recorded them at New York's Music Building studio. The songs recorded at that time—seven of which were written solely by Madonna—were released in Pre-Madonna.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, {{two local}} men spotted Sabina whilst walking a dog on Christchurch Street, Fenton. One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E
5|$|The storyline behind Styles versus Abyss {{began at}} TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February13, where Abyss {{defeated}} Jeff Hardy in a Full Metal Mayhem match {{to earn a}} future NWA World Heavyweight Championship title shot. During a backstage segment on the February18 episode of Impact!, Abyss gave the title match contract to Traci, wanting it given to DOA Dusty Rhodes as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> become Rhodes' personal assistant at the time. On the March25 episode of Impact!, Abyss tried to retrieve his contract from now co-assistant to Rhodes, Traci. This led to a brawl with Styles {{as he tried to}} defend Traci and co-assistant Trinity as they fled in fear from Abyss. The match was then announced on the April1 episode of Impact!. Rhodes announced on the April8 episode of Impact! that the winner of the bout would get their title shot at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on May15.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E

After some short-lived pleasantries and some curt references to Annabel's ex-marriage, Alice states she was dismissed by her sister, Miriam, not for inefficiency as Annabel believes, but because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stop Miriam finishing her father off. These claims are backed up by a letter from their father expressing his fears, and, knowing the will was changed in Annabel's favour, Alice demands £100,000 in compensation. Ignoring Annabel's threats to go to the Police for blackmail, she promises to return tomorrow.|$|E

In The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe - X-Men (2004), it is stated that her powers enable her to breathe while moving at any speed and protect her from air friction, while granting her protection from temperature extremes of heat and cold; the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update #1 (2007) states that Storm's body changes temperature in opposition to her environment so that the colder the environment the warmer her body gets, and the warmer the environment the colder her body gets.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with feelings of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E

25|$|Wenceslao Retana, a {{political}} commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, {{a newspaper in}} Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison {{the wife of a}} cousin, but she said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.|$|E
25|$|The {{news of the}} crash, {{initially}} {{reported as}} an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali sector commander Luc Marchal to send a patrol to the crash site. Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Lando Ndasingwa. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported {{that all of the}} hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh to inform him of developments. Uwilingiyimana called back to confirm that it was the president's jet and he was presumed to be on board. She also asked for UNAMIR help in regaining control of the political situation, as she was legally next in the line of succession, but some moderate ministers allied to her had already begun fleeing their homes, fearing for their safety.|$|E
25|$|His own {{far left}} inclinations were by then {{contrasting}} with his civil service positions, which he maintained {{even as his}} daughter Ecaterina was becoming a persona non grata. In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as În temnițele rusești ("In the Russian Dungeons"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of Furnica ("The Ant"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still {{a contributor to the}} central leftist press: in December 1926, Adevărul published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pašić, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to one interpretation, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed {{to take care of her}} ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.|$|E
