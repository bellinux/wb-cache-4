The room temperature fretting wear behavior {{appears to be a}} complicated process involving both the formation of transfer layers and tribo-oxidation of the materials, and the resulting extent of wear seems to correlate with hardness. An increase in the fretting test temperature to 500 degrees C causes a thick iron oxide layer to form. This oxide film prevents the sialon from being worn and lowers the coefficient of friction. The pin-on-disk tests show even more markedly than the fretting experiments that the <b>sialons</b> lend to wear more against 42 CriMo 4 steel than against GG 25 cast iron. In addition, the diffusion couple experiments show that the <b>sialons</b> react more with 42 CrMo 4 steel than with GG 25 cast iron, and they also indicate that the amount of chemical interaction between the <b>sialons</b> and 42 CrMo 4 steel increases with the amount of intergranular phase. During the drilling of GG 25 cast iron, on the other hand, it appears that the tribological performance of the <b>sialons</b> correlates with the hardness of the <b>sialons,</b> which is influenced by the amount and nature of the intergranular phases in the <b>sialons.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
