40|$|An {{anisokinetic}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{system was}} designed for sampling particles at a constant low flow rate from a ventilation duct to an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). Shrouded anisokinetic nozzles are a means for sampling from a moving airstream with higher particle transmission than with unshrouded isokinetic nozzles. This <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> sampling system was evaluated in an experimental ventilation duct system. Aspiration and transport efficiency measurements were made for five particle sizes in the range 1 - 13 μm at each of three duct air speeds in the range 2. 2 - 8. 8 m/s. Under these conditions, the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> system showed improved performance compared to buttonhook isokinetic nozzles, especially for larger particles and higher air speeds. Measured transmission efficiencies through the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> sampling system were generally higher and more reliably predictable than those through buttonhook isokinetic nozzles. Model predictions of transport and aspiration efficiencies of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> system showed good agreement with measurements over {{the entire range of}} experimental conditions. The <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> sampling system could be used to measure concentrations in ventilation ducts with an APS for particles in the diameter range 1 - 13 μm.

40|$|Hot flow aero-acoustic {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with Pratt & Whitney's High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) Mixer-Ejector Exhaust Nozzles by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) in the GEAE Anechoic Freejet Noise Facility (Cell 41) located in Evendale, Ohio. The tests evaluated the impact of various geometric and design parameters on the noise generated by a two-dimensional (2 -D) shrouded, 8 -lobed, mixer-ejector exhaust nozzle. The shrouded mixer-ejector provides noise suppression by mixing relatively low energy ambient air with the hot, high-speed primary exhaust jet. Additional attenuation was obtained by lining the shroud internal walls with acoustic panels, which absorb acoustic energy generated during the mixing process. Two mixer designs were investigated, the high mixing "vortical" and aligned flow "axial", along with variations in the shroud internal mixing area ratios and shroud length. The shrouds were tested as hardwall or lined with acoustic panels packed with a bulk absorber. A total of 21 model configurations at 1 : 11. 47 scale were tested. The models were tested over a range of primary nozzle pressure ratios and primary exhaust temperatures representative of typical HSCT aero thermodynamic cycles. Static as well as flight simulated data were acquired during testing. A round convergent unshrouded nozzle was tested to provide an acoustic baseline for comparison to the test configurations. Comparisons were made to previous test results obtained with this hardware at NASA Glenn's 9 - by 15 -foot low-speed wind tunnel (LSWT). Laser velocimetry was used to investigate external as well as ejector internal velocity profiles for comparison to computational predictions. Ejector interior wall static pressure data were also obtained. A significant reduction in exhaust system noise was demonstrated with the 2 -D <b>shrouded</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs...|$|E

40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{impact on}} the environment over the utilization of the conventional energy based fossil fuel is obvious. Thus, the effort on the reduction on the dependency on this unclean fuel is salient. The application of the clean renewable wind power {{can be one of the}} appropriate measures in supporting the effort in reducing the dependency on the unclean fuel. Performance is one of the essential aspects in determining the economic attractiveness on the technology application. One of the factors responsible to the performance of the power technology is the wind velocity acting on the rotor blade. The addition of a shroud element is believed to have a great promise to increase the velocity at rotor, thus possibly improving the performance of the wind turbine. This study presents an experiment on horizontal and vertical wind turbines incorporated with rounded shroud devices. The experiment is conducted in a vehicle to simulate the effect of the flow of wind. The results on this experiment indicate that the addition of the shroud device with geometry of diffuser improves the performance of the horizontal axis wind turbine. For the <b>nozzle</b> <b>shroud</b> geometry, it seems to less significantly improve the performance of the horizontal axis wind turbine. For the vertical turbine, the incorporation of the <b>shroud</b> devices, both <b>nozzle</b> and diffuser, has almost no effect to increase the performance. This study also presents the discussion for the reasons behind the experimental results by relating to the condition of the turbine rotation and the wind velocity inside the shroud devices...|$|R

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{conducted}} {{three of}} the six tests needed to verify that the effluent monitoring system for the new Canister Storage Building ventilation exhaust stack meets applicable regulatory performance criteria for air sampling systems at nuclear facilities. These performance criteria address both the suitability of the location for the air-sampling probe and the transport of the sample to the collection devices. The criteria covering the location for the air-sampling probe ensure that the contaminants in the stack are well mixed with the airflow at the probe location such that the extracted sample represents the whole. The sample-transport criteria ensure that the sampled contaminants are quantitatively delivered to the collection device. The specific performance criteria are described in detail in this report.

In test runs at facility Mach numbers of 5 to 7, an exhaust instrumentation ring which formed {{an extension of the}} engine exhaust <b>nozzle</b> <b>shroud</b> provided diagnostic measurements at 10 circumferential locations in the HRE combustor exit plane.

The dual-stream concept was tailored to attenuate nearfield pressure disturbances without compromising nozzle performance. Adjoint-based anisotropic mesh refinement was applied to resolve nearfield compression and expansion features in the baseline viscous grid. Deformed versions of the adapted grid were used for subsequent adjoint-driven shape optimization. For design, a nonlinear gradient-based optimizer was coupled to the discrete adjoint formulation of the Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes equations.
