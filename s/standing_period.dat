Sixteen subjects (eight females and eight males), aged between 23 - 29 years, participated in the experiment. They performed a sorting task in front of a grading table by picking and placing objects for 90 minutes in two posture (1) standing and (2) standing using a footrest. Muscle activity was recorded with surface EMG through disposable electrodes. The result shows that standing for ninety minutes developed fatigue in lower limb muscles and back muscles that lead to low back pain. Standing using a footrest result proper posture for prolonged <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> and reduce force at the back. It also results less fatigue and reduce the %MVC of EMG. So, it is recommended to attach a footrest in standing workstation to reduce the fatigue and discomfort. Keywords:fatigue, posture, standing,lower limb, EM...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} concern about antibiotic-resistant {{bacteria}} (ARB) in water, {{there have been many}} studies on inactivation of ARB by chlorination. In order to examine possible increase in ARB concentrations after a retention time, this study was performed to explore not only inactivation, but also reactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) K 12. Observed immediately after chlorination for 10 minutes, inactivation results demonstrated that even ampicillin concentration of 2 mg/L enhances inactivation of bacteria nearly up to 100 %. Reactivation of surviving cells was observed after 24 -h retention time in the study. Reactivation results showed that MIC 50 and MIC 90 for 0 mg Cl 2 /L were below 4 mg/L of ampicillin. However, both MIC 50 and MIC 90 were much higher after chlorination; MIC 50 and MIC 90 for 1 mg Cl 2 /L were greater than 16 mg/L of ampicillin.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of how the cementing technique influences cement penetration is important for surgeons to plan and conduct hip resurfacing procedures. Therefore the aim {{of this study is to}} determine the influence of the following parameters on cement penetration: use of pulse lavage, type of cement, and the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> of the cement. Nine fresh frozen paired whole cadaver femora were used to investigate cement penetration. The femora were divided into three paired groups: (A) compared the use of pulse lavage to no pulse lavage, (B) compared two low viscosity bone cements SULCEM- 3 (Zimmer GmbH, Switzerland) and Surgical Simplex (Stryker Orthopaedics, USA), and (C) compared bone cement viscosities using standing times of 1. 5 min. and 3 min. The Durom Hip Resurfacing implant (Zimmer GmbH, Switzerland) was used in all groups. A single slice was taken out of the center of each head. Cement penetration ratio (penetration area divided by the bone area enclosed by implant) and mean cement penetration depth were measured. Cement penetration is increased using pulse lavage, and has the tendency to increase with increasing the cement standing time from 1. 5 to 3 min. No difference in cement penetration was found when different cement brands of comparable viscosity were used...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} four preruminant calves to measure the energy cost and the diurnal pattern of physical activity in tethered, fed calves and to determine whether differences in activity could interfere with the interpretation of circadian changes in heat production. Measurements were carried out in large respiration chambers (3, 650 L of inner volume), and a computation method was presented that allowed the calculation of the energy cost of standing for each <b>standing</b> <b>period.</b> This cost averaged 449 cal. kg BW- 1. h(- 1) (SE = 41. 6, n = 4). It represented a 23 to 27 % increase in heat production above that measured in the lying state. This estimate and its standard error were lower than values obtained by regression (2, 131 cal. kg BW- 1. h(- 1), SE = 862. 2, n = 8). The energy cost of standing was highest after meal times and lowest at night. These variations could reflect the nonuniform activity patterns of calves while standing. The time spent standing per hour showed the same variations during the day as the energy cost of standing. Noteworthy, the elevated energy expenditure measured in the Ist h after the morning meal was due to activity cost rather than to meal thermogenesis. Standardization of diurnal heat production profiles to a given activity pattern thus seemed to be necessary...|$|E

Aim: To establish the prevalence of OH, and its association with falling, in home-dwelling older participants with and without type 2 diabetes. Design and setting: A cross-sectional study in primary care in the Netherlands. Method: A total of 352 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 211 without participated in this study. OH {{was defined as a}} fall in blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic after either 1 or 3 minutes in an upright position. Feelings of dizziness, light-headedness, or faintness during the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> were documented as orthostatic complaints. Fall risk was assessed with a validated risk profile instrument. Results: The prevalence of OH was 28 % (95 % CI = 24 % to 33 %) and 18 % (95 % CI = 13 % to 23 %) in participants with and without type 2 diabetes, respectively. OH was not related to falling, while the presence of orthostatic complaints in itself was associated with both previous fall incidents as well as a high fall risk, even after adjustment for OH. The adjusted odds ratios were 1. 65 (95 % CI = 1. 00 to 2. 72) and 8. 21 (95 % CI = 4. 17 to 16. 19), respectively.

40|$|Background: Reducing sitting-time may {{decrease}} risk {{of disease}} and increase life-span. In the search for approaches to reduce sitting-time, research often compares sitting to standing and ambulation, but the energetic cost of standing alone versus sitting is equivocal, with large variation in reported mean values (0 % to > 20 % increase in energy expenditure (EE) during standing). Objective: To determine the magnitude and time-course of changes in EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) during steady-state standing versus sitting. Design: Min-by-min monitoring using a posture-adapted ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry system was conducted in 22 young adults with normal BMI during 10 min of steady-state standing versus sitting comfortably. Results: This study reveals three distinct phenotypes based on the magnitude and time-course of the EE response to steady-state standing. One-third of participants (8 / 22) showed little or no change in EE during standing relative to sitting (ΔEE < 5 %; below first quartile). Of the 14 responders (ΔEE 7 – 21 %), 4 showed sustained, elevated EE during standing, while 10 decreased their EE to baseline sitting values {{during the second half}} of the <b>standing</b> <b>period.</b> These EE phenotypes were systematically mirrored by alterations in RQ (a proxy of substrate oxidation), with ΔEE inversely correlated with ΔRQ (r = 0. 6 – 0. 8, p < 0. 01).

40|$|The red swamp {{crayfish}} (Procambarus clarkii) is a freshwater {{invasive species}} {{which has become a}} worldwide problem. Recent work on ectozoochory of freshwater macrocrustacean species indicated {{that there might be a}} possibility of transport of recently-hatched crayfish by birds. In this context, we applied a new set of methods to quantify the probability of transport of recently-hatched crayfish, namely with moving animal vectors. First, we tested the desiccation resistance of crayfish and the capacity of crayfish to cling to mallard's feet, depending on the standing time of the feet. We also determined the ability of recently-hatched crayfish to cling to an artificially moving freshly dead mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and finally, we determined the time required for the death of 50 % and 90 % of the individuals of recently-hatched crayfish under conditions similar to those of mallard flight. Recently-hatched crayfish were able to survive up to 225 min out of water, withstanding longer at a lower temperature and therefore transport does not seem to be limited by desiccation survival. The duration of the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> of duck's feet positively affected the probability of transport of crayfish. Recently-hatched crayfish were able to cling to a moving duck and the probability of clinging was significantly affected by the water depth, being lower at greater depths. Moreover, when transported on a freshly dead duck under flight simulation conditions the time required for the death of 50 % and 90 % of the individuals were 2 min 14 s and 4 min 53 s, respectively. These flight durations correspond to transport distances of 2. 8 km and 6. 1 km, respectively, which is enough for transport to another aquatic system. The results demonstrate that passive transport of recently hatched P. clarkii by actively moving waterbirds is possible, and therefore it will likely enhance the local process of invasion...|$|E

A high salt diet of 150 - 200 mmol Na+ d- 1 was also administered. Combined treatment reduced orthostatic dizziness in all patients (P less than 0. 001), and increased the maximal <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> to at least 10 min. HUT alone (n = 4) reduced the BP decrease after 1 min of standing from - 64 /- 42 /- 25 +/- 29 / 21 / 17 mmHg to - 53 /- 37 /- 23 +/- 31 / 24 / 20 mmHg (P less than 0. 01 for systolic BP). Addition of fludrocortisone to HUT (HUT/fludro) (n = 5) further reduced the BP decrease after 1 min of standing from - 63 /- 40 /- 24 +/- 20 / 12 / 11 mmHg to - 21 /- 19 /- 8 +/- 12 / 10 / 5 mmHg (P less than 0. 05 for systolic, mean and diastolic BP, respectively). BP at maximal standing time increased from 58 / 47 / 42 +/- 9 / 8 / 7 mmHg initially to 95 / 69 / 57 +/- 27 / 22 / 20 mmHg during combined treatment (P less than 0. 05 for systolic and mean BP), and remained unchanged during the 14 -month (range 8 - 70 month) follow-up period.

Objective: We sought to evaluate physical capacity and disability in a group of osteoporotic patients. Material and methods: Fifteen women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures (G 1), 20 women with osteoporosis without vertebral fractures (G 2), and 20 control women (G 3) were selected. the variables of physical capacity were measured using a treadmill. the patients spent 4 min standing quietly, 4 min walking at 3 km/h, and 10 min walking at 4 km/h. the SF- 36 questionnaire was also applied. Results: the results showed that women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures (G 1) had increased kyphosis angle (median 60 degrees), while the angle was 43. 5 degrees for G 2 and 37 degrees for G 3. Oxygen consumption (VO 2 (kg)), METS (metabolic equivalent), and energy expenditure (kcal/h) during the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> were higher in G 1 than in G 2 (G 1 vs G 2, p= 0. 016, p= 0. 017, and p= 0. 012, respectively), whereas no difference in these parameters was observed between groups during the walking period. the energy expenditure during walking at 3 km/h and at 4 km/h showed a correlation with thoracic kyphosis in G 1 (p= 0. 01 and p= 0. 017, respectively). No difference in SF- 36 scores was observed between the three groups. Conclusion: Energy expenditure showed a correlation with the angle of thoracic kyphosis. Patients with or without osteoporosis showed the same energy expenditure during the walking period. the SF- 36 score was similar for the three groups.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the non-evaporative {{components}} of the reduced thermal insulation of wet clothing, experiments were performed with a manikin and with human subjects in which two layers of underwear separated by an impermeable barrier were worn under an impermeable overgarment at 20 °C, 80 % RH and 0. 5 ms- 1 air velocity. By comparing manikin measurements with dry and wetted mid underwear layer, the increase in heat loss caused by a wet layer kept away from the skin was determined, {{which turned out to}} be small (5  6 W m- 2), irrespective of the inner underwear layer being dry or wetted, and was only one third of the evaporative heat loss calculated from weight change, i. e. evaporative cooling efficiency was far below unity. In the experiments with eight males, each subject participated in two sessions with the mid underwear layer either dry or wetted, where they stood still for the first 30 min and then performed treadmill work for 60 min. Reduced heat strain due to lower insulation with the wetted mid layer was observed with decreased microclimate and skin temperatures, lowered sweat loss and cardiac strain. Accordingly, total clothing insulation calculated over the walking period from heat balance equations was reduced by 0. 02 m 2 °C W- 1 (16 %), while for the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> the same decrease in insulation, representing 9 % reduction only showed up after allowing for the lower evaporative cooling efficiency in the calculations. As evaporation to the environment and inside the clothing was restricted, the observed small alterations may be attributed to the wet mid layers increased conductivity, which, however, appears to be of minor importance compared to the evaporative effects in the assessment of the thermal properties of wet clothing.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of heat (50 - 85 degrees C) and high {{pressure}} treatment (400 - 700 MPa at 10 - 60 degrees C) on the foaming properties of egg white solutions (10 % v/v or 9. 64 mg protein/mL). These physical treatments (20 min) were performed at two pH levels: pH 7. 6 corresponding to the pH of fresh egg white and pH 8. 8, corresponding to that of older egg white. Both heat and pressure treatment affected the foaming properties of egg white proteins. While foams from untreated egg white solutions were crispy and subject to collapse of the foam column after a long <b>standing</b> <b>period,</b> foams from heat and pressure-treated egg white solutions were moist and creamy, showing smaller bubble size and little or no sensitivity to foam collapse. The effect of physical treatments was strongly dependent on the pH during treatment. The most voluminous foams were obtained at pH 8. 8, while the most stable, dense foams were obtained at pH 7. 6, for both heat and pressure treatment. Based on previous data {{on the effect of}} heat and pressure treatment on the physicochemical properties of egg white proteins, the relationship between the processing-induced changes in these physicochemical properties and the foaming properties of egg white was investigated. Treatments resulting in a high level of protein unfolding, yet accompanied by a certain degree of residual protein solubility (primarily at pH 8. 8), resulted in egg white solutions with improved foaming ability. A high level of unfolding combined with extensive protein solubility loss (primarily at pH 7. 6) was associated with increased foam stability and density. Foams with high volume and average stability and density were obtained by pressure treatment at pH 8. 8 (above 500 MPa). The processing-induced changes in the foaming properties could not be attributed to the changes in a single physicochemical property. The foaming ability was in part determined by the sulfhydryl content and protein flexibility. Improved protein-protein interactions (solubility and exposed SH groups) contributed to increased foam stability of treated egg white solutions. Other properties, not measured in this study, probably also contribute to the foaming properties of processed egg white solutions, especially after pressure treatment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Configura-se como uma análise de políticas públicas, tendo como foco o exame das implicações da política de fundos para a efetivação/materialização da valorização docente no Estado. Para a realização da pesquisa, foi desenvolvida uma revisão bibliográfica sobre financiamento, política de fundos e valorização docente, com base nos trabalhos e obras de autores renomados da área. A pesquisa também envolveu a análise documental da legislação federal e estadual referente ao financiamento e à valorização docente, de documentos elaborados pelos órgãos oficiais do Estado e por outras instituições tais como sindicatos da categoria. Foi organizada de modo a {{articular}} informações quanti-qualitativas, tal como proposto por Gamboa (1995) dos indicadores de remuneração docente, carreira e formação dos professores na rede estadual de ensino do Estado do Pará durante o período de vigência do FUNDEF (1996 a 2006) e os três primeiros anos de vigência do FUNDEB (2007 a 2009). A análise dos dados foi complementada com a realização de entrevistas semiestruturadas realizadas com ex-presidente do INEP (2003 - 2004) e ex-assessor de financiamento educacional da UNDIME Nacional (2004 - 2006); aos membros dirigentes do SINTEPP, membros do Conselho Estadual de Educação (CEE) e aos representantes da categoria docente no Conselho do FUNDEF/FUNDEB. A pesquisa permitiu concluir que, embora a implementação do FUNDEF e do FUNDEB no âmbito do Estado e, nacionalmente, tenha estimulado alguns avanços legais no sentido de garantir aos profissionais do magistério, direitos importantes relacionados à formação inicial e continuada, a um plano de carreira e a melhor remuneração como elementos de valorização docente, ainda está longe de proporcionar a sua real valorização. Na rede estadual de ensino do Pará, a partir da implementação da política de fundos, foi possível perceber que, com o estímulo financeiro, ainda que mínimo, proporcionado pelo FUNDEF/FUNDEB, houve uma tendência ao longo do período no sentido de reduzir o número de professores leigos. Embora se perceba aumento significativo no número de professores com o ensino superior completo, os mesmos não possuíam formação em cursos de licenciatura, o que se configura como um grave problema para a educação no Estado. Em termos de vencimento-base, constatou-se que os mesmos recebem valores abaixo do valor do piso salarial estabelecido pela Lei 11. 738 / 2008. No período analisado tanto o professor AD- 1 quanto o AD- 2 registraram uma pequena elevação de sua remuneração com o pagamento dos abonos. No que diz respeito ao professor AD- 4, este sofreu desvalorização de sua remuneração ao longo do período. Todavia, a análise dos dados da PNAD tornou evidente que a remuneração do professor no Estado é baixa, tanto em relação aos profissionais com ensino médio, quanto em relação às profissões de maior prestígio social com formação superior. No geral, estes professores, mesmo recebendo o abono FUNDEF/FUNDEB, não conseguiram equiparar sua remuneração com as destes profissionais. No que se refere à carreira, apesar da conquista da categoria ao aprovar o PCCR, nem este instrumento e tampouco o Estatuto conseguiram estabelecer regulamentações capazes de dar conta, efetivamente, da valorização do magistério no Pará. Faz-se necessário garantir em termos percentuais e financeiros aumentos reais à remuneração dos professores com a obtenção das progressões e titulações.

It figures as an analysis of public policies, focusing {{the examination of the}} implies of the policy of funds to effect/materialize of teachers valorization in the State. To do the research, was developed a bibliographic review about financing, policy of funds and teachers` valorization, {{based on the work of}} renowed authors in the field. The research also developed a documental analysis of the state and federal law about the financing and the teachers valorization, the document elaborated by the State official agencies and by other institutions such as class syndicates. It was organized in a way to articulate quantitative and qualitative information, as proposed by GAMBOA (1995) the teachers` indicators of remuneration, career and formation in the State Education Network of Pará during the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> of FUNDEF (1996 to 2006) and the three first years of the <b>standing</b> <b>period</b> of FUNDEB (2007 to 2009). The data analysis was complemented with semi structured interviews with the former president of INEP (2003 2004) and the former assessor of educational financing of national UNDIME (2004 - 2006); the leader members of SINTEPP, members of the State Council of Education/ CEE and representative of the teachers class in the Council of FUNDEB/ FUNDEF. The research allowed to conclude that though the implantation of FUNDEF and FUNDEB in the State and nationally had encouraged some law advancement in a way to guarantee some important rights to the mastership professionals, important rights related to the basic and continued formation, a career plan and a better remuneration as elements of teachers `valorization, is still far to proportion it`s real valorization. In the State Education Network of Pará, from the implementing of the policy of funds, was possible realize that, with the financial encouragement, even if it`s the minimum proportioned by FUNDEF/ FUNDEB there was a tendency along the period in a way to reduce the number of lay teachers. Though is realized a meaningful number of graduated teachers, the same didn`t have degree of licentiate, what means a serious problem for the education of the State. About the salary basis, was realized that those professionals earn values that are under the value of the salary basis established by the law 11. 738 / 2008. In the analyzed period, the teacher AD- 1 as the AD- 2 registered a low increase in their remuneration with the payment of a bonus. About the Teacher AD- 4, this one suffered the devaluation of its remuneration along the period. Nevertheless, the analysis of the data of PNAD turned clear that the remuneration of the teacher in the State is low, related to the professionals that concluded high school education, as about the professions with higher social status with superior education. Generally, these teachers, even receiving FUNDEF/ FUNDEB bonus, didn`t get to fit out their remuneration to these professionals. About the career in spite of the conquest of the class in approving the PCCR, neither this instrument nor the statue got to set a regulation able to effectively get a valuation of the mastership in the State. It`s necessary guarantee in the percentage and financial term a real increase in the teachers `remuneration, with the attainment of progress and qualification...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Standing</b> for {{prolonged}} <b>periods</b> {{can lead}} to certain cardiovascular disorders. In a study by Krause et al. (2000) the authors {{examined the relationship between}} standing at work and the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in men. <b>Standing</b> for long <b>periods</b> can change the distribution of blood in the extremities. This in turn causes the blood to pool and reduces the circulating blood plasma volume leading to hemodynamic changes that impact the body. The authors reported that long <b>periods</b> of <b>standing</b> at work were significantly associated with atherosclerotic progression. This study provides evidence that hemodynamic changes from standing can influence the progressions of carotid atherosclerosis. The authors also found that men with carotid stenosis or ischemic heart disease were at greater risk for the progression of atherosclerosis [...] Atherosclerosis {{can lead to}} coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and aneurysms.|$|R
