With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only}} one having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

During the early Julio-Claudian era, regiments were often stationed in their native or neighbouring provinces, The Flavian era (69-96) <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> changes in auxiliary deployment in what appears a deliberate policy of deploying regiments away from their original home province.

Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister.

In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it happening and I didn't {{know what to make}} of it.

She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a {{vacation}} or left England during the forty {{years before he}} died. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, {{similar to those of}} Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his [...] "reclusiveness" [...] to be myth: [...] "e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people... {{he was one of the}} most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone." [...] Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and had thought London a superior film production center to New York.|$|E

60|$|After {{the first}} glow of attainment, this initial view was, I will confess, disillusioning. Instead of what {{unfettered}} fancy had {{led me to}} expect, I <b>saw</b> only <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> terraced rice-fields backed by ranges of low hills; {{for all the world}} a parquet in green and brown tiles. And yet, as the wish to excuse prompted me to think, was this not, after all, as it should be? For I was looking but {{at the entrance to the}} land, its outer hallway, as it were; Nanao, its capital, its inland sea, all its beyond was still shut from me by the nearer hills. And feeling thus at liberty to be amused, I forthwith <b>saw</b> it as <b>a</b> satire on panoramas generally.|$|R
60|$|By {{the end of}} half an hour, {{standing}} on the heaving deck and shooting at bottles floating on the rolling swell, I found that I broke each bottle at the first shot.

In an hour's time I could, shooting quickly and at short range, empty my magazine at a block and hit it nine times, and, on occasion, ten times, out of eleven.|$|R

2500|$|While on tour in Prague in 2009, Reznor {{realized}} {{the importance of}} the marketing aspect of a major label when he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> promotion for Radiohead's then-upcoming tour, but little promotion for his current Nine Inch Nails tour or any of its recently released albums. Reznor said the marketing from a major label outweighed the aspects of being independent that he liked, namely the ability to release albums whenever he wanted to avoid leaking, and to take a larger cut of the profits from record sales. Reznor's first album released through a major label after his return was How to Destroy Angels' An Omen EP released in November 2012 through Columbia Records. On working with Columbia for the release of the EP, Reznor said that [...] "so far it's been pleasantly pleasant".|$|E
