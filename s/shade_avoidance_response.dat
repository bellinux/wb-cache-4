50|$|Seedling {{response}} {{is the most}} well understood factor of shade avoidance. In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response</b> varies {{at different points in}} the life cycle. Dry, dormant seeds will not germinate if they are in the shade. Once dormancy has been broken and they have imbibed water, the seeds are committed to germination. Water-imbibed seeds display hypocotyl elongation; if the shade were caused by excessive soil depth, this would help the seedling grow vertically very quickly and push {{up and out of the}} ground. If an Arabidopsis seedling becomes shaded, its petioles and internodes elongate. It may even lose rosette morphology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response</b> {{in adult}} plants is less {{commonly}} studied {{than it is}} in seedlings, though adult Arabidopsis show more complex response patterns than seedlings. Shaded adults have elongated petioles at the rosette, smaller leaf blades, and suppressed axillary bud growth. By elongating the petiole sideways, the plant repositions its leaves away from shading plants to absorb more red light, though there is a trade off in leaf size. The leaves can also bend upwards towards potential light sources as a result of higher growth {{on the underside of the}} petiole than the top, a process called hyponasty. Flattening of leaves in plants with normally curled leaves also increases surface area for light absorption.|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{hypothesis is}} that canopy shyness {{has to do with}} mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response</b> is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species. Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants are able to sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red (FR) light, a task largely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome photoreceptors. Many species of plant respond to an increase in FR light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the FR stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation. Similarly, blue (B) light is used by plants to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants, though this modality is just beginning to be characterized.|$|E
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} {{proximate}} neighbors with {{a suite of}} responses that comprise the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> syndrome. These phytochrome-mediated responses include hyponasty (i. e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We showed recently that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, showing an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses.</b> Furthermore, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) enhanced ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses,</b> whereas ethylene-insensitive plants showed reduced <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses.</b> Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> at all to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA 3, with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA 3 in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> are suit of {{adaptive}} reactions for gaining sufficient light by plants grown in shading conditions. This phenomenon consists of enhanced elongation of shoot-like organs, upward movements {{of leaves and}} accelerated flowering and fruit-set. Adaptive reactions result from the activity of many plant growth regulators. Our study was focused on DELLA proteins which are components of gibberellin (GA) plant hormone signaling in regulating <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> of Arabidopsis petioles and hypocotyls.

40|$|Plants {{growing at}} high densities express <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> traits as a {{response}} to the presence of neighbours. Enhanced shoot elongation is one of the best researched <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> components and increases light capture in dense stands. We show here that also leaf movements, leading to a more vertical leaf orientation (hyponasty), may be crucial in the early phase of competition. The initiation of <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> is classically attributed to the action of phytochrome photoreceptors that sense red:far-red (R:FR) ratios in light reflected by neighbours, but also other signals may be involved. It was recently shown that ethylene-insensitive, transgenic (Tetr) tobacco plants, which are insensitive to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, have reduced <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> to neighbours. Here, we report that this is not related to a reduced response to low R:FR ratio, but that Tetr tobacco plants are unresponsive to a reduced photon fluence rate of blue light, which normally suppresses growth inhibition in wild-type (WT) plants. In addition to these light signals, ethylene levels in the canopy atmosphere increased to concentrations that could induce <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> in WT plants. Together, these data show that neighbour detection signals other than the R:FR ratio are more important than previously anticipated and argue for a particularly important role for ethylene in determining plant responses to neighbours...|$|R
50|$|Studies using Brassica rapa {{indicate}} that the light quality and ratio available to seedlings is sensed in the cotyledons, which upregulates the production of auxin. Arabidopsis was used to demonstrate PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) involvement in auxin production. PIFs are transcription factors that regulate thousands of genes related to germination repression and shade avoidance, and PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 directly regulate genes that code for the enzymes required in auxin synthesis. Other PIF proteins {{are thought to be}} involved in regulating auxin and the plant's response. In shade conditions, PR induces the dephosphorylation of PIF proteins, which strengthens their ability to bind DNA and promote transcription of genes involved in <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response,</b> including in the production of auxin and its receptors. Auxin is transported to the hypocotyl to promote elongation, although the mechanism it uses to do so remains unclear.|$|E

PIF family proteins have been well-studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, but little is known about their physiological functions and molecular mechanisms in maize (Zea mays). In this study, we investigated the physiological functions of ZmPIF 4 and ZmPIF 5, two highly conserved members of the PIF gene family. RT-qPCR and western blot analyses revealed that ZmPIF 4 and ZmPIF 5 expression and ZmPIF 4 and ZmPIF 5 levels peak at night and remain low during the day. Overexpression of ZmPIF 4 and ZmPIF 5 in Arabidopsis partially rescued the reduced hypocotyl elongation and defective response to gravity in pif 1 pif 3 pif 4 pif 5 quadruple mutants (pifq). In addition, under high red: far-red light conditions, Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmPIF 4 exhibited a constitutive <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response,</b> including early flowering, slender leaves and inflorescences, plant lodging and precocious leaf senescence. Furthermore, ZmPIF 4 physically interacted with the Arabidopsis DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF GA 1 - 3 (RGA), indicating a potential interaction between ZmPIF 4 and gibberellin signaling pathway on plant growth. Taken together, our results revealed that ZmPIF 4 and ZmPIF 5 are functionally conserved proteins that may play conserved roles in the response to phytochrome signaling in plants.

40|$|A plant {{growing in}} the field has the unique ability to sense the {{presence}} of other plants growing near by and adjust its growth rate accordingly. This ability to detect neighbors, which is referred to as <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response,</b> is mediated by members of the phytochrome family which detect light in the red (R) and far-red (FR) region of the spectrum. Work done by several laboratories has shown that low R/FR provides the signal for <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response</b> during which the elongation of stem-like organs occurs at the expense of leaf development. However, the mechanism by which the low R/FR signal is transduced to attenuate leaf development has remained largely unknown.

By exploiting mutant analysis in combination with genome wide expression profiling, we have identified a novel regulatory circuit underlying plant response to canopy shade.

40|$|Plants {{detect the}} {{presence}} of neighbouring vegetation by monitoring changes in the ratio of red (R) to farred (FR) wavelengths (R:FR) in ambient light. Reductions in R:FR are perceived by the phytochrome family of plant photoreceptors and initiate a suite of developmental <b>responses</b> termed the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> syndrome. These include increased elongation growth of stems and petioles, enabling plants to overtop competing vegetation. The majority of <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> experiments are performed at standard laboratory growing temperatures (> 20 °C). In these conditions, elongation responses to low R:FR are often accompanied by reductions in leaf development and accumulation of plant biomass.

40|$|Plants modify {{growth in}} {{response}} to the proximity of neighbors. Among these growth adjustments are <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses,</b> such as enhanced elongation of stems and petioles, that help plants to reach the light and outgrow their competitors. Neighbor detection occurs through photoreceptor-mediated detection of light spectral changes (i. e. reduced red:far-red ratio [R:FR] and reduced blue light intensity). We recently showed that physiological regulation of these responses occurs through light-mediated degradation of nuclear, growth-inhibiting DELLA proteins, but this appeared to be only part of the full mechanism. Here, we present how two hormones, auxin and ethylene, coregulate DELLAs but regulate <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> through DELLA-independent mechanisms in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Auxin appears to be required for both seedling and mature plant shoot elongation responses to low blue light and low R:FR, respectively. Auxin action is increased upon exposure to low R:FR and low blue light, and auxin inhibition abolishes the elongation responses to these light cues. Ethylene action is increased during the mature plant response to low R:FR, and this growth response is abolished by ethylene insensitivity. However, ethylene is also a direct volatile neighbor detection signal that induces strong elongation in seedlings, possibly in an auxin-dependent manner. We propose that this novel ethylene and auxin control of <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> interacts with DELLA abundance but also controls independent targets to regulate adaptive growth responses to surrounding vegetation...|$|R

40|$|Light exerts {{two primary}} roles in plant growth and development. Plants acquire all {{biochemical}} energy required {{for growth and}} propagation solely from light energy via photosynthesis. In addition, light serves as a medium through which plants recognize environmental fluctuations, such as photoperiod and presence of neighboring animals and plants. Plants therefore constantly monitor the direction, intensity, duration, and wavelength of environmental light and integrate these light signals into the intrinsic regulatory programs to achieve an optimized growth in a given light condition. Although light regulates all aspects of plant growth and developmental aspects, the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades involved have not been well established until recently. However, recent advances in genetic tools and plant transformation techniques greatly facilitated the elucidation of molecular events in plant photomorphogenesis.

Analyses of light signaling mutants defective in branching provide insight into the molecular events associated with the phenomenon. It is well documented that phytochrome B (phyB) mutant plants display constitutive <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses,</b> including increased plant height and enhanced apical dominance. We investigated the phyB- 1 mutant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and analyzed the expression of the sorghum Teosinte Branched 1 gene (SbTB 1), which encodes a putative transcription factor that suppresses bud outgrowth, and the sorghum dormancy-associated gene (SbDRM 1), a marker of bud dormancy. Buds are formed in the leaf axils of phyB- 1; however, they enter into dormancy soon after their formation. The dormant state of phyB- 1 buds is confirmed by the high level of expression of the SbDRM 1 gene. The level of SbTB 1 mRNA is higher in the buds of phyB- 1 compared to wild type, suggesting that phyB mediates the growth of axillary shoots in response to light signals in part by regulating the mRNA abundance of SbTB 1. These results are confirmed by growing wild-type seedlings with supplemental far-red light that induces <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses.</b> We hypothesize that active phyB (Pfr) suppresses the expression of the SbTB 1 gene, thereby inducing bud outgrowth, whereas environmental conditions that inactivate phyB allow increased expression of SbTB 1, thereby suppressing bud outgrowth...|$|R

The phytochrome family is composed of the light-labile phyA and several light-stable members (phyB-phyE in Arabidopsis). phyA accumulates to high levels in etiolated seedlings and is essential for young seedling establishment under a dense canopy. In photosynthetically active seedlings high levels of phyA counteract the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response.</b> phyA levels are maintained low in light-grown plants {{by a combination of}} light-dependent repression of PHYA transcription and light-induced proteasome-mediated degradation of the activated photoreceptor. Light-activated phyA is transported from the cytoplasm where it resides in darkness to the nucleus where it is needed for most phytochrome-induced responses. Here we show that phyA is degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, phyA degradation is significantly slower in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. In the nucleus phyA is degraded in a proteasome-dependent mechanism even in its inactive Pr (red light absorbing) form, preventing the accumulation of high levels of nuclear phyA in darkness. Thus, light-induced degradation of phyA is in part controlled by a light-regulated import into the nucleus where the turnover is faster. Although most phyA responses require nuclear phyA it might be useful to maintain phyA in the cytoplasm in its inactive form to allow accumulation of high levels of the light sensor in etiolated seedlings...|$|E

The shape of a leaf is the result of intricate developmental processes, including heteroblastic progression (changes in leaf size and shape at different nodes) and the developmental stage of an organ. The leaflets that arise from complex leaves are additionally modified by their positioning along the proximal-distal axis of a leaf and whether they fall on the left or right side of leaves. Even further, leaves are environmentally responsive, and their final shape is influenced by environmental inputs. Here, we comprehensively describe differences in leaflet shape between wild tomato (Solanum section Lycopersicon) species using a principal component analysis on elliptical Fourier descriptors arising from > 11, 000 sampled leaflets. We leverage differences in developmental rate to approximate a developmental series, which allows us to resolve the confounding differences in intrinsic leaflet form and developmental stage along positions of the heteroblastic leaf series and proximal-distal axis of leaves. We find that the resulting developmental trajectory of organs at different positions along these axes are useful for describing the changes in leaflet shape that occur during the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response</b> in tomato.

The SAS responses are of great importance in agriculture, for example in terms of planting density and resource allocation. The research was initiated with a genetic screen of a T-DNA insertional mutant population of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, where specific light conditions were used to isolate candidate genes potentially involved in the fine tuning of plant responses to shaded conditions. A mutant line (N 9299) was isolated through this screen. The mutant was subsequently shown to contain a T-DNA inserted in the Auxin Response Factor 18 (ARF 18) gene. Phytochrome (PHY) and Phytochromes-interaction factors (PIFs) are the main controllers of the <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>response.</b> This work demonstrates that ARF 18 is involved in light perception in plants, calibrating {{the response to the}} stimulus and acting as a temporary repressor to allow the accumulation of other molecular players. PIFs can activate the expression of ARF 18, allowing a negative feedback mechanism to resolve the specific response to a given light condition. The pleiotropic phenotype of the N 9299 mutant has revealed that ARF 18 is a key regulator of growth and development, and the work described here has opened new avenues of research into light perception and response mechanisms and other important physiological and morphological processes in plants...|$|E
40|$|Plants detect {{different}} {{facets of}} their radiation environment via specific photoreceptors to modulate growth and development. UV-B is {{perceived by the}} photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR 8). The molecular mechanisms linking UVR 8 activation to plant growth are not fully understood, however. When grown {{in close proximity to}} neighboring vegetation, shade-intolerant plants initiate dramatic stem elongation to overtop competitors. Here we show that UV-B, detected by UVR 8, provides an unambiguous sunlight signal that inhibits <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana by antagonizing the phytohormones auxin and gibberellin. UV-B triggers degradation of the transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 and stabilizes growth-repressing DELLA proteins, inhibiting auxin biosynthesis via a dual mechanism. Our findings show that UVR 8 signaling is closely integrated with other photoreceptor pathways to regulate auxin signaling and plant growth in sunlight...|$|R
40|$|Color poster with text, images, diagrams, and graphs. A plant's {{ability to}} {{perceive}} {{and respond to}} both {{the quantity and quality}} of light is essential for healthy growth and development. One way in which plants respond to changing light conditions is via their perception of red (~ 680 nm) and far red (~ 730 nm) wavelengths of light. To do this, plants rely on a group of photoreceptors known as phytochromes (PHYs). PHYs mediate a variety of light responses, including de-etiolation and <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses.</b> The purpose of this study was to identify mutations which exacerbate the red light hypersensitivity conferred by the lrb 1 lrb 2 mutations using a genetic enhancer screen in order to find other actors in red light signaling.

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin {{is involved}} in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through polar auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. <b>Shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>responses</b> are well- known processes that require polar auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <b>shade</b> <b>avoidance</b> 4 (sav 4), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. SAV 4 encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV 4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV 4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, {{which appears to be}} necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV 4 and ATP-binding cassette B 1 (ABCB 1) auxin transporter in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) revealed that SAV 4 blocks ABCB 1 -mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that polarly localized SAV 4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients...|$|R
