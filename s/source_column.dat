Since column data is uniform type therefore, there are some opportunities for storage size optimization in Column-store, many renowned compression schemes such as RLE & LZW that make use of similarity of adjacent data to compress. Good Compression can also be achieved using bitmap index by order of magnitude through the sorting. The Run Length Encoding works best for the columns of ordered data, or data with few distinct values. This ensures long runs of identical values which RLE compresses quite well.

In addition, modeling has provided many insights into ion-sample interactions and the resultant effects on the sample.

Insignificant proximity effects in resist-based ion beam lithography, combined with the availability of sub-nm ion spot sizes, opens the way to sub- 10 nm structures and dense patterns.

For the steadystatescenario, theNBsystem will have to provide a highNBpower level with a high wall-plugefficiency (η∼ 60 %). Neutralization of the energetic negative ions by photodetachment (so calledphotoneutralization), if feasible, appears to be the ideal solution to meet these performances, in thesense that it could offer a high beam neutralization rate (> 80 %) and a wall-plug efficiency higher than 60 %. The main challenge of this new injector concept is the achievement of a very high power photonflux which could be provided by 3 MWFabry–Perot optical cavities implanted along the 1 MeVD−beam in the neutralizer stage. The beamline topology is tall and narrow to provide laminar ion beamsheets, which will be entirely illuminated by the intra-cavity photon beams propagating along thevertical axis.

40|$|Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) is a {{single-chain}} protein containing two {{active site}} domains (named N- and C-domains according to {{position in the}} chain). ACE is bound to plasma membranes by its C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane anchor. Ileal fluid, rich in ACE activity, obtained from patients after surgical colectomy {{was used as the}} <b>source.</b> <b>Column</b> chromatography, including modified affinity chromatography on lisinopril-Sepharose, yielded homogeneous ACE after only a 45 -fold purification. N-terminal sequencing of ileal ACE and partial sequencing of CNBr fragments revealed the presence of an intact N terminus but only a single N-domain active site, ending between residues 443 and 559. Thus, ileal-fluid ACE is a unique enzyme differing from the widely distributed two-domain somatic enzyme or the single C-domain testicular (germinal) ACE. The molecular mass of ileal ACE is 108 kDa and when deglycosylated, the molecular mass is 68 kDa, indicating extensive glycosylation (37 % by weight). In agreement with the results reported with recombinant variants of ACE, the ileal enzyme is less Cl(-) -dependent than somatic ACE; release of the C-terminal dipeptide from a peptide substrate was optimal in only 10 mM Cl-. In addition to hydrolyzing at the C-terminal end of peptides, ileal ACE efficiently cleaved the protected N-terminal tripeptide from the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and its congener 6 - 31 times faster, depending on the Cl- concentration, than the C-domain in recombinant testicular ACE. Thus we have isolated an active human ACE consisting of a single N-domain. We suggest that there is a bridge section of about 100 amino acids between the active N- and C-domains of somatic ACE where it may be proteolytically cleaved to liberate the active N-domain. These findings have potential relevance and importance in the therapeutic application of ACE inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the sky using the most {{energetic}} photons {{plays a crucial role}} in detecting and exploring high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Observations conducted over recent years with new ground-based and space-borne gamma-ray instruments reveal that the universe is full of extreme accelerators, i. e., objects with surprisingly high efficiency for acceleration of electrons. In particular such an efficient acceleration is observed in gamma-ray-loud binary (GRLB) systems. GRLBs are a newly identified class of X-ray binaries in which interaction of an outflow from the compact object with the wind and radiation emitted by a companion star leads to the production of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission. Only five such systems have been firmly detected as persistent or regularly variable TeV gamma-ray emitters. All GRLBs detected in the TeV energy range contain a hot, young star and exhibit variable or periodic emission at multiple wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Details of the physical mechanism of the high-energy activity of GRLBs are not clear yet. Broad multi-wavelength observations are crucial to reveal the characteristic energies of the relativistic wind and better {{understanding of the nature of}} these sources. It looks quite possible that all these systems can be understood within the “hidden pulsar” model, and the observed differences are due to the different sizes of the system. In my work, I concentrate on the X-ray and gamma-ray emission observed from gamma-ray binaries PSR B 1259 − 63 and LS I + 61 ◦ 303 with Suzaku, XMM-Newton, Swift, Chandra and Fermi observatories. In PSR B 1259 − 63, the compact source is a young 48 ms radio pulsar orbiting Be-type star with period of 3. 4 years. During my studies, I have been intensively involved in the analysis of the results of two multi-wavelength campaigns organized in 2010 and 2014 during the periastron passages in this system. These observations reveal complex spectral variability of the source as it passes through the disk of the companion star. In my work, I have tested different theoretical models trying to reproduce the observed behaviour.
