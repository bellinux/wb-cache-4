40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{that causes the}} end of lamp life (EOLL) phenomenon in a fluorescent lamp should be clarified to achieve an effective measure for that. The EOLL phenomenon, including the tungsten sputtering from an electrode, is investigated. We observed the electron emission from a lead {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>stem</b> <b>glass.</b> The electron emission causes the intermittent pulse discharge that heats up the <b>stem</b> <b>glass.</b> The concentration of lamp current directly into one of leads is another factor to heat up a small glass portion around the lead. The comparison of the <b>stem</b> <b>glass</b> resistance and the glow discharge impedance between leads after the filament disconnection indicates whether or not the <b>stem</b> <b>glass</b> will begin to soften. It was shown that the heating of a small glass portion around the lead was a dominant factor that resulted in the final stage of EOLL, that is, a substantial overheating of a lamp end portion. The way of operation for testing the life-ended fluorescent lamps is expected to contribute to the further understanding of the alkali metal adsorbate on metal surface...|$|R

5000|$|American glass {{factories}} {{were founded}} first in New York in 1732 {{and then in}} South Jersey by Caspar Wistar in 1739. The 1730s saw an increasing variety of products. Boston merchants advertised wine glasses, jelly glasses, syllabubs, decanters, sugar pots, barrel cans, punch bowls, bird fountains, and candlesticks. Merchants also offered japanned glassware. [...] "For those who did buy taste in the newest styles, drinking glasses were the inverted baluster type (popular in England from 1720 to about 1735) or the later drawn <b>stem</b> <b>glass</b> (1730-1745)." [...] Both types {{have been found in}} Virginia. Wealth and fashion did not dictate an elaborate collection of glass, for the Reverend Ebenezer Thayer who died in nearby Roxbury {{less than a year later}} had £137 worth of silver. But his only glass was some salts in the parlor.|$|R

50|$|The {{style of}} glassmaking changed by 1746 when the {{government}} passed the Glass Excise Bill, which taxed glass by weight; beginning in 1751 advertisements in a Boston newspaper made a reference to “new fashion” glass. Usually the phrase referred to the air twist <b>stemmed</b> <b>glass</b> or “wormed wine glasses” that had first been advertised in the Boston market in 1746. By 1761, glasses and decanters were also engraved or “flowered”. Glassmakers worked diligently to provide special glasses for specific purposes, and inevitably only the well-to-do could afford a full array of forms. The inventory of Governor Francis Fauquier’s glass is revealing, when the former Governor of Virginia died in 1768, he left: 5 beer glasses, 5 champagne glasses, 14 water glasses, 55 wine glasses, 59 syllabub glasses, 69 jelly glasses, 23 glass salvers, 15 decanters and 8 cruets. He also had three sets of salvers that made up into large pyramids; the largest pyramid was valued at £15. Such pyramids were advertised in the Boston press in 1772.During the Federal Period, after the American Revolutionary War, Americans adopted new European styles. During the Revolutionary period, decoration was minimal. Although the American glass industry was making a strong beginning, considerable quantities were still imported. Cut glass was advertised in Baltimore as early as 1786, gaining popularity {{toward the end of}} the period. American production of blown three-mold glass began during the War of 1812. Glassmakers Henry William Stiegel and John Frederick Amelung had both tried to produce elaborate, fine table glass rivaling the European imports and both failed because there was not yet a market for the work they produced.|$|E
50|$|Berkemeyers were {{originally}} carved from birch tree branches (berkemei) and {{were provided with}} lids.

50|$|Chalices and goblets are large, <b>stemmed,</b> bowl-shaped <b>glasses</b> mainly {{associated}} with Trappist and Abbey ales.

25|$|Incandescent {{light bulbs}} consist of an {{air-tight}} glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical {{connections to the}} filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a <b>stem</b> or <b>glass</b> mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.|$|R

The majority of the pieces are impressed with the company logo, a raised capital letter [...] "H" [...] inscribed in a diamond of approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) in length.

Besides, Individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality." ...|$|R
