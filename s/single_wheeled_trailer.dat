50|$|During the World War II, {{compelled}} by fuel rationing in the United States, Merle Williams of Long Beach, California invented a two-wheeled electric motorcycle that towed a <b>single</b> <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer.</b> Due to {{the popularity of}} the vehicle, Williams started making more such vehicles in his garage. In 1946, it {{led to the formation of}} the Marketeer Company (current-day ParCar Corp.).|$|E
50|$|Instead of panniers, some riders {{prefer a}} bicycle trailer. Trailers {{are easy to}} use and allow touring with bikes on which it is {{impossible}} to attach racks. However, double <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other hand, <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are extremely maneuverable, with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.|$|R

50|$|The Hawk system {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of component elements. These elements were typically fitted on <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> making the system semi-mobile. During the system's 40-year life span, these components were continually upgraded.|$|R
25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all <b>wheels.</b> <b>Trailer</b> air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a hand lever could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|R

50|$|The {{engineer}} {{vehicle is}} based on the infantry carrier. Its most distinctive feature is a mine-clearance blade, it is most often towing a <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> loaded with additional equipment. The vehicle is capable of clearing mines on paved surfaces and some rubble clearance. Other mobility tasks can be completed by the mounted engineer squad with the tools on the vehicle and trailer.|$|R

40|$|Wheel design can be {{enhanced}} through experimentation, testing, and iteration. Unfortunately, {{the time and money}} needed to test full vehicles is costly. A cheaper, less conflated alternative could be to incorporate <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> testing. The algorithm discussed in this paper uses sinlge wheel testing to predict the full vehicle performance in a skid steer turn. With this prediction algorithm, skid steering can be easily enhanced by iterating on the design of a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> without the cost of vehicle testing. To validate this algorithm and explore skid steering enhancement several <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> skid steering experiments were done and the results were compared to a full vehicle's turning performance...|$|R

40|$|Light Rail Vehicles (LRV) {{have to go}} in {{curves of}} small radius (< 20 m) and cannot compense the {{different}} distances of their rotating wheels by the wheel profile. That results in a transversale sliding of the wheels with increased wear, strong noise and additional power losses. These disadvantages can be avoided if each <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> has its own rating. To guide the <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> by an adjusting device an appropriate sensor system had to be chosen, it had to be adapted for this special application and it had to be tested on a test vehicle.

2500|$|Eventually Bottrill, in {{association}} with A. H. MacDonald & Co. of Richmond Melbourne, began producing steam and oil-based tractors fitted with his wheels. The most famous was known as [...] "Big Lizzie" [...] built in 1915 with a wheel diameter of 7 feet 2 inches (2.2m). At 34 feet (10.4m) long and 45 tons (46 tonnes); with two dreadnought <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers,</b> it was capable of carrying a total of 80 tons (81 Tonnes) and effectively making its own roads.|$|R

5000|$|... 1957 - Southern Pacific {{steam engine}} #982 was {{dedicated}} at Hermann Park and the Mini-train service was established. The engine was saved after a newspaper letter from Peter Whitney got 75 replies and Southern Pacific donated {{the engine to}} the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the city. It took 5 days to move it from Blodgett to the Park, as rails were laid in the streets in front of it. The locomotive was relocated by 50 <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> to Minute Maid Park in 2005.|$|R
50|$|A 'fifth-wheel' is {{a travel}} trailer {{supported}} by a hitch {{in the center of}} the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be connected by simply driving the tow vehicle under the <b>trailer.</b> Fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits over the bed of the pickup, it also reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a gooseneck hitch is an option to fifth-wheel.|$|R

50|$|A <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> and launcher, each {{carrying}} two missiles in containers, was planned for deploying the Hadès. The original design had {{a range of}} 250 km, which was later increased to 480 km. The guidance system was an inertial platform which could be programmed to execute evasive maneuvers before hitting the target. A version designed to hit hardened underground targets also had a final guidance system which used a GPS-based digital system, resulting in a Circular Error Probable of only 5 m, compared to a CEP of 100 m for the standard version.|$|R

50|$|The Scott Carpenter Station was {{the only}} habitat ever {{designed}} to be launched from a <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer,</b> much like a boat. This design feature enabled it to be transported to schools and other venues for touring and educational outreach between missions. The education and outreach function was one of its primary features, and figured importantly in its missions. Many classroom to seafloor connections were made, including links to schools in Oklahoma, Florida, California and north of the Arctic Circle in Canada’s Baffin Bay such as Pond Inlet, Nunavut.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b> The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from <b>single</b> versus dual <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual <b>wheels</b> and on <b>single</b> <b>wheels,</b> instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
