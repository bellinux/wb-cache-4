5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the <b>superclass,</b> accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the <b>superclass,</b> they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>superclass</b> Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of {{vertebrate}} animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.|$|E
5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based {{systematics}} {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} <b>superclass,</b> and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was {{not a member of the}} group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group). The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.|$|E

Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and hagfish in the <b>superclass</b> Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate <b>superclass</b> is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the <b>superclass</b> Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and {{peregrine}} falcon respectively, are chordates, as are humans.

25|$|The axiom schema of {{collection}} {{is closely related}} to and frequently confused with the axiom schema of replacement. While replacement says that the image itself is a set, collection merely says that some <b>superclass</b> of the image is a set.

50|$|Languages {{that support}} {{before and after}} methods, such as Common Lisp (specifically the Common Lisp Object System), provide a {{different}} way to avoid this anti-pattern. The subclass's programmer can, instead of overriding the <b>superclass's</b> method, supply an additional method which will be executed before or after the <b>superclass's</b> method. Also, the <b>superclass's</b> programmer can specify before, after, and around methods that are guaranteed to be executed in addition to the subclass's actions.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the above}} fields may not be {{applicable}} (e.g. if an object does not have static fields).

40|$|Lin et al. ([URL], 2006) {{proposed}} a nested Markov compliance class {{model in the}} Imbens and Rubin compliance class model framework to account for time-varying subject noncompliance in longitudinal randomized intervention studies. We use <b>superclasses,</b> or latent compliance class principal strata, to describe longitudinal compliance patterns, and time-varying compliance classes are assumed {{to depend on the}} history of compliance. In this paper, we search for good subject-level baseline predictors of these <b>superclasses</b> and also examine the relationship between these <b>superclasses</b> and all-cause mortality. Since the <b>superclasses</b> are completely latent in all subjects, we utilize multiple imputation techniques to draw inferences. We apply this approach to a randomized intervention study for elderly primary care patients with depression. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{to reduce the number}} of declared exceptions either by declaring a <b>superclass</b> of all potentially thrown exceptions, or by defining and declaring exception types that are suitable for the level of abstraction of the called method and mapping lower level exceptions to these types, preferably wrapped using exception chaining in order to preserve the root cause. In addition, it's very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method's implicit interface anyway.|$|E

25|$|The Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) {{which in}} English stands for International Amateur Cycling Federation, {{which was based}} in Rome, Italy, was the amateur cycling arm of the UCI. It had direct ties to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It had no {{professional}} division. That was the purview of its professional counterpart based in Luxembourg, the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP), also operated by the UCI. However, a class of paid amateurs called the <b>Superclass</b> is allowed {{even though it may}} contradict the accepted notions of what an amateur is. However, members of the Supercross class could not win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. In any case, with the allowance of professionals in the Olympics this has largely become a moot point. USA Cycling, formerly the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) as it was known at the time, was the American affiliate of FIAC. However, it did not have a BMX division at this time. The NBL worked through the then independent IBMXF. Today after purchasing the NBL USA Cycling the NBL represents BMX in the UCI through USA Cycling.|$|E

500|$|The {{evolution}} of tetrapods began about 400 {{million years ago}} in the Devonian Period with the earliest tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Tetrapods are categorized as a biological <b>superclass,</b> Tetrapoda, which includes all living and extinct amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. [...] While most species today are terrestrial, little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest tetrapods could move about on land, as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate they dragged their bellies around. Presumably, the tracks were made by animals walking along the bottoms of shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.|$|E
500|$|Marxists, who {{are skeptical}} of right-wing populist {{conspiracy}} theories, also accuse the global power elite {{of not having}} {{the best interests of}} all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the <b>superclass</b> are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see is that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E

The Dylan linearization is monotonic, easily described, strictly observes local precedence order, and produces the same ordering as CLOS when that is monotonic.

2500|$|In the {{old days}} of the IBMXF when you raced an IBMXF sanctioned race you {{received}} NBL state points and points that went toward your international standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for national number one plates. The World Championship title was open to 16 & over Experts and older amateurs in the 20" [...] class as well as Pros in the 20" [...] class. There is a class in European BMX called <b>Superclass.</b> In this class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted definition of amateur. However, no racer in <b>Superclass</b> could win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF affiliate the NBL, <b>Superclass</b> is the equivalent of the old [...] "B" [...] pro class and [...] "A" [...] pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World Championships.|$|E

Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins, vertebrate musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China: Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella.
