In March 2008, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reshuffled his Cabinet, from which time Sadasivan retained only his portfolio at the Foreign Affairs Ministry until his death in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Ang Mo Kio GRC was contested by the Workers' Party of Singapore in {{the general}} {{election}} of 2006, and Sadasivan retained his seat, the PAP winning with 66.14% of the votes polled in the constituency.

In May 2007, he was appointed Chairman of the WHO Executive Board, the first time a Singaporean had been so elected since the nation became a member of WHO. During his term, he dealt with issues such as global health development, pandemic preparedness (including the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic), non-communicable diseases and climate change.|$|E

5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, the provisional government was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted to install the provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the <b>state</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

Brown had diverse investments, was a {{director}} or officer of several sugar companies, and Vice-President of the Hawaiian Bell and Mutual Telephone Company when service to the Hawaiian Islands was being developed. Brown was also the founding President of the first national bank chartered in Hawaii.|$|E

At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government.|$|E

5|$|Dominica having {{fallen to}} Monckton's forces in June, the British then set their {{sights on the}} French stronghold of Martinique. Britain's Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Southern Department, Sir William Pitt, {{concluded}} that Martinique's capture would be the decisive battle {{for control of the}} Caribbean, and instructed that all available resources be committed to its invasion. An army of 13,000 troops was assembled, supported by a fleet under Admiral George Rodney. Levant was added to Rodney's sizeable command in late 1761 and sailed as part of the expedition in January 1762. She was present when the British landings commenced but is not recorded as having engaged with enemy forces either there or in the subsequent French defeat at Fort Royal between 25 January and 3 February.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes, and {{a violent}} Naxalite {{movement}} damaged {{much of the}} state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the <b>state</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next three decades.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E

5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora was ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department signposted {{the highway}} {{system in the}} <b>state</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. At that time, M-57 {{designation}} was originally used in Charlevoix County from Boyne Falls at M-13 (now US131) through Boyne City and back to then M-13. That highway's number was changed to M-75 in 1926. By the next year, the number was then assigned to a state trunkline that connected between Quinnesec and the Wisconsin state line in the Upper Peninsula. This second iteration was short-lived as it was replaced by an extension of US141 into Michigan.|$|E
