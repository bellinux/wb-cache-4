Whereas the skin is a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> due to its dryness and acidity, the conjunctiva (membrane covering the eye) is, instead, protected by secreted enzymes, mainly lysozyme and defensin.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Instalation of <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> against {{diagnostic}} x-ray is generally done {{based on the}} recommendations of NCRP 49. There are analytic methods for designing <b>protective</b> <b>barriers</b> howerer, they lack sufficient efficiency and considering the NCRP 49 reports, designing mechanical <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> {{in order to protect}} the initial x-ray radiation and absorption of the ray quality of such radiation is different. Therefore, the <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> for each radiation is measured separately. In this study, a computer software was designed to calculate the needed barrier with high accuracy. Materials and methods: Calculation of required <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> particularly when two or more generators are in use at diagnostic x-ray units and or installed diagnostic equipments do not have proper room space and the limitations for other clanges in parameters which are time- consuming and impossible to be manually calculated. For proper determination of thichness of the <b>protective</b> <b>barrier,</b> relevant information about curves of radiation weakness, dose limit etc should be entered. This program was done in windows and designed in such a way that the operator works easily, flexibility of the program is acceptable and its accuracy and sensitivity is high. Results : Results of this program indicate that, in most cases, in x-ray units required <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> was not used. Meanwhile sometimes shielding is more than what required which lacks technical standards and cost effectiveness. When the application index is contrasting zero, thichness of NCRP 49 calculation is about 20 % less than the calculated rate done by the method of this study. When the applied index is equal to zero (that is the only situation where the second barrier is considered), thickness of requined barrier is about 15 % less than the lead barrier and concrete barrier calculated in this project is 8 % less than that calculated by McGuire method. Conclusion : In this study proper determination of required protective thickness for weakening of radiation to the permitable level is proposed. The multi radiation sources in a single room are considered and non garanteed radiation of NCRP 49 hypothesis are removed. Difference between the the oritical and calculated rates this of method is X 2 = 10 - 5 which indicates accuracy and high efficiency of this software...|$|R

In fact, experimental data support the idea that an optimal amount of CHO in cell membranes is necessary to create a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> against toxic agents. A reduced amount of cellular CHO in the plasma membrane alters this <b>protective</b> <b>barrier,</b> reducing the protection against toxic agents, including the β-amyloid protein [7].

40|$|Several ANL ongoing {{experimental}} {{programs have}} measured metal waste form (MWF) corrosion and constituent release. Analysis of this data has initiated {{development of a}} consistent and quantitative phenomenology of uniform aqueous MWF corrosion. The effort so far has produced a preliminary fission product and actinide release model based on measured corrosion rates and calibrated by immersion test data for a 90 C J- 13 and concentrated J- 13 solution environment over 1 - 2 year exposure times. Ongoing immersion tests of irradiated and unirradiated MWF samples using more aggressive test conditions and improved tracking of actinides will serve to further validate, modify, and expand the application base of the preliminary model-including effects of other corrosion mechanisms. Sample examination using both mechanical and spectrographic techniques will better define both the nature and durability of the <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> layer. It is particularly important to assess whether the observations made with J- 13 solution at 900 C persist under more aggressive conditions. For example, all the multiplicative factors in Table 1 implicitly assume the presence of <b>protective</b> <b>barriers.</b> Under sufficiently aggressive test conditions, such <b>protective</b> <b>barriers</b> {{may very well be}} altered or even eliminated...|$|R
