The drum head, <b>stand,</b> <b>microphone</b> stands, and PA box are often decorated with paintings or eagle feathers, fur, flags, and strips of colored cloth.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{father died}} in 1953, {{and by the time}} she turned ten, she was the primary {{breadwinner}} of her family through singing at events and on local radio and television shows. During that time, she appeared regularly on the country music show [...] "TV Ranch" [...] on WAGA-TV in Atlanta; she was so short, the host would lower a <b>stand</b> <b>microphone</b> as low as it would go and stand her up on a wooden crate to reach it. In 1955, Grayce Tarpley was remarried to Buell [...] "Jay" [...] Rainwater, who moved the family to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he worked at the Jimmy Skinner Music Center. Lee performed with Skinner at the record shop on two Saturday programs broadcast over Newport, Kentucky radio station WNOP. The family soon returned to Georgia, however, this time to Augusta and Lee appeared on the show [...] The Peach Blossom Special on WJAT-AM in Swainsboro.|$|E
50|$|Freddie Mercury (the {{lead singer}} of Queen), {{discovered}} the device by accident: he grabbed a standard <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> {{with such force that}} it dislodged from its base. For the rest of his career he used a bottomless <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> regularly. Robbie Williams as well as heavy metal singers Joey Belladonna of Anthrax and Chuck Billy of Testament also use bottomless <b>microphone</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Korn's Jonathan Davis {{commissioned}} Giger {{to design}} and sculpt a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand,</b> with the requirement that it be biomechanical, erotic, and movable. The contract allowed for five aluminium <b>microphone</b> <b>stands</b> to be made, but Davis purchased {{only two of the}} three to which he was entitled. The design of the <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> was later adapted to Giger's [...] "Nubian Queen", transforming it into a fine art sculpture.|$|R
50|$|A rare type of <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> is the {{bottomless}} microphone stand—essentially a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> with no base, so {{a singer}} must hold it throughout a live performance. It is {{useful as a}} mobile prop.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "boom arm" [...] {{attaches}} {{to the top of}} the <b>stand</b> so the <b>microphone</b> can move in the horizontal plane. A guitar player, for example, might use this to place the microphone directly in front of his mouth without having the upright portion of the stand in the way of the guitar. It also lets musicians have the microphone closer to the sound source when floor space is at a premium. This can be particularly useful when placing microphones on a drum <b>stand</b> when the <b>microphone</b> <b>stands</b> must compete for space with things like cymbal stands. Boom arms are offered both in fixed length and adjustable (telescoping) lengths.|$|R

50|$|As a vocalist for Lightning Bolt and Mindflayer, Chippendale eschews {{the usual}} <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> and {{conventional}} <b>microphone,</b> instead using a contact microphone. This microphone is then run through an effects processor {{to alter the}} sound further. Chippendale often warbles or makes nonsensical sounds into the microphone, so the vocals typically come out extremely distorted and incomprehensible. More recently, Chippendale has used a Line 6 delay pedal to delay and repeat his vocals while drumming.|$|R
40|$|SoundCatcher is {{an open-air}} gestural {{controller}} designed {{to control a}} looper and time-freezing sound patch. It makes use of ultrasonic sensors to measure {{the distance of the}} performer’s hands to the device located in a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand.</b> Tactile and visual feedback using a pair of vibrating motors and LEDs are provided to inform the performer when she is inside the sensed space. In addition, the rotational speed of the motors is scaled according to each hand distance to the <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> to provide tactile cues about hand position. 1...|$|R

50|$|A <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> is a {{free-standing}} mount for a microphone. It {{allows the}} microphone {{to be positioned}} in the studio, on stage or on location without requiring a person to hold it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{in progress}} {{for the development of}} a gestural controller interface for contemporary vocal performance and electronic processing. The paper includes a preliminary investigation of the gestures and movements of vocalists who use <b>microphones</b> and <b>microphone</b> <b>stands.</b> This repertoire of gestures forms the foundation of a well-practiced 'language' and social code for communication between performers and audiences and serves as a basis for alternate controller design principles. A prototype design, based on a modified <b>microphone</b> <b>stand,</b> is presented along with a discussion of possible controller mapping strategies and identification of directions for future research...|$|R

50|$|Fans of glam metal {{often have}} long or very long, teased hair, and {{are dressed in}} spandex pants and/or leather jackets. They also may use (though not necessarily) some makeup (lipsticks, eye-shadows, tonal creams, etc.). Bands who play in glam metal genre may have {{instruments}} with extravagant colour(s) and attributes, like guitars with pink, violet, dalmatian or pink rose colour(s); <b>microphone</b> <b>stands</b> with (often) a leopard or silk scarf (there may be some different attributes attached to the <b>microphone</b> <b>stand,</b> but mostly only leopard-colour scarfs have been seen); drumkits with some artwork (this kind of drumkit is seen in other metal genres as well, not only in glam metal).|$|R
50|$|On December 14, 2008, a TV journalist, Muntadhar al-Zaidi, threw two {{shoes at}} Bush during a Baghdad press conference. Bush {{successfully}} dodged both, but Perino's eye was injured by a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> during the commotion surrounding al-Zeidi's arrest.|$|R

The microphone kit (two SM57 <b>microphones,</b> windscreens, <b>microphone</b> <b>stands,</b> and black right-angle XLR cables) is referred to as the VIP/high-profile microphone kit.|$|R
50|$|Three or more {{microphones}} {{are suspended}} above the speakers {{by means of}} a cable and <b>stand.</b> The <b>microphones</b> are pulled back, switched on, and released over the speaker, and gravity causes them to swing back and forth as pendulums. As the microphone nears the speaker, a feedback tone is created. Different lengths of cable will swing at different speeds, creating an overlapping series of feedback squeals. The music created is thus the result of the process of the swinging microphones.|$|R
50|$|Ruffin's {{most notable}} non-vocal {{contribution}} to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed <b>microphone</b> <b>stand.</b> This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.|$|R
500|$|On-stage gimmicks {{have long}} {{been a part of}} {{performances}} at the competition. Lena Philipsson's use of a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> in her performance of [...] "Det gör ont" [...] at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show {{what had happened to the}} <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of Dagens Media criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was [...] "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" [...] and the event had become [...] "a cross between [...] Fame Factory and [...] Stadskampen".|$|R
50|$|The first gigs {{were either}} really good or really bad. One {{of the most}} talked about gigs {{in the early years}} is to be played in Volta, where a girl takes place on a bar stool behind a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand,</b> only to drink wine and smoke cigarettes.|$|R
500|$|The {{first song}} to be {{performed}} was [...] "The Thought of You" [...] which involved the group playing around Jordan who sang at a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand.</b> The whistle and accordion player were sitting down. The second song [...] "Walk With Me", involved more movement by the group than the first song, with Jordan at the <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> while the whistle and accordion player were again sitting down. The third song was [...] "Until We Meet Again", and featured lots of movement by the group with arm movements by Jordan. The fiddle and accordion players were seen sitting down. The final song was [...] "They Can't Stop The Spring", which began slowly with a long tin whistle introduction, before speeding up towards the chorus. The song also featured Jordan playing the bodhrán behind the microphone.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, Jonathan {{unveiled}} a <b>microphone</b> <b>stand</b> art piece dubbed [...] "The Bitch", {{which was created}} by Swiss artist H.R. Giger. As of 2014, Davis has been seen using wireless Shure Beta 87a and SM87 microphones for live performances. In the studio, Davis uses various microphones, most prominently the Sanken CU-44x.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} was as flamboyant {{as the music}} suggested, with the band dressed variously in grey spandex (Glam) and wearing a military hat (Teeny) among other things. Paying tribute to the Orange Revolution which {{had taken place in}} host country Ukraine the year before, Glam attached an orange banner to his <b>microphone</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|R
