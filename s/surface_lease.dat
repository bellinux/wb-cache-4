40|$|As part of {{the broader}} Arctic Urban Sustainability project which is {{examining}} sustainable development in the Circumpolar North, this thesis was intended to explore the role of corporate social responsibility in mining as a contributing factor to sustainable development. This was done through the examination of two northern case studies: Cameco Corporation’s uranium mining operations located in the Northern Administration District of the central Canadian province of Saskatchewan, and Northern Iron’s iron mining operation located {{near the town of}} Kirkenes along the northeastern border of Norrbotten in Norway. 	The methodology utilized in this case study was Leslie Pal’s public policy framework which asserts that public policy statements consist of four components: the definition of the policy problem, formulation of policy goals, and the use of specific policy instruments, followed by policy evaluation. This methodology was used to frame the corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies of Cameco and Northern Iron. Data was gathered {{from a variety of sources}} including interviews, policy documents, and academic research. 	Within the literature CSR is primarily understood as a voluntary action undertaken by companies for a variety of reasons ranging widely from effective corporate leadership within the company to greenwashing of the company’s image. The results of this research suggest that the role of the state in the initiation and implementation of CSR is of much greater importance than is predominantly recognized within the literature. This thesis argues that legal requirements instituted by government have the potential to lead to the initiation and implementation of CSR practices by mining companies. 	In the case of Cameco the Mine <b>Surface</b> <b>Lease</b> Agreements agreed to by the company and the provincial government provided motivation for the company to develop and implement their world-renowned CSR practises, which in turn led to a number of benefits for the company and surrounding communities. In the case of Northern Iron’s operations in Kirkenes, working hour requirements instituted by the Norwegian Government contributed to significantly higher levels of local employment in the region. These findings are important because they demonstrate that government may have a greater role to play in encouraging companies to initiate and implement CSR policies which contribute to improved socioeconomic outcomes for northern communities...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of aboriginal people in Saskatchewan {{has led to}} several government and private sector initiatives aimed at facilitating the participation of aboriginal people in modern industrial society. A case study was performed on Cameco Corporation, the largest mining company in Northern Saskatchewan, {{to find out if}} and how government and private sector initiatives to increase the participation of aboriginal people in the northern mining industry are working. Emphasis was put on defining the status of aboriginal employees within Cameco's mining workforce with respect to job training, promotion, job position, wage rate, and job satisfaction. A simple quantitative evaluation of survey responses was used to establish the position of Cameco's aboriginal/northern employees among their non-aboriginal co-workers and among the typical population residing {{in the northern part of}} the province. In 1994, 42. 3 % of Cameco's employees at the mine sites were of aboriginal ancestry. Based on Cameco's 1994 employee survey, it was found that relative to the typical person residing in the North, Cameco northern/aboriginal employees had a higher level of schooling, more full time work activity, and a higher employment income. Relative to their colleagues, aboriginal Cameco workers were younger, less educated, fewer years employed and more representative in low skill level/low paying jobs. Aboriginal people were provided with more job training, received more promotions, and had a slightly lower overall job satisfaction. Based on these findings, OLS and Logit multiple regression analyses were performed to identify how much of the difference between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Cameco workers, regarding employment related issues, could actually be explained by aboriginal ethnicity. Results showed that, when compared to their colleagues, aboriginal people were more likely to be promoted and to receive job training. However, aboriginal people were less likely to be employed in high level job positions and to earn a high wage rate. Many results are positive indicators of successful government and private sector initiatives to improve aboriginal peoples' employability by extensive human resource development programs in accordance with recent <b>Surface</b> <b>Lease</b> Agreements. Nevertheless, as shown by this example from the mining industry, the achievement of equal opportunities and of a fully equalized job distribution between aboriginal and non-aboriginal employees will be a long-term process...|$|E

5000|$|Numerous other industries, in {{addition}} to the petroleum industry, often require the skills and expertise of the landman, one of which is the wind industry. Wind development requires the locating of surface sites for turbines, determining <b>surface</b> ownership, negotiating <b>lease</b> agreements, and has many other similar duties performed by the petroleum landman. Telecommunications, pipeline, power and transportation projects, linear in nature, are generally right-of-way (ROW) projects and usually staffed by ROW agents. The terms [...] "landman" [...] and [...] "right-of-way agent" [...] are often used interchangeably; however, their duties often vary significantly. Landmen typically deal with site-specific projects (drill site) and leases, whereas ROW agents deal with linear corridor projects that can cross interstate and usually involve easement conveyance.|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites are materials where {{carbon fibers}} {{are used to}} reinforce a matrix to produce a light and strong material with important applications in the aerospace industry. There are {{many aspects of the}} preparation of these materials that would benefit from a study which combines the research of groups involved in the production, testing and analysis of these materials, and studies of the basic surface chemistry involved. This final reports presents the results of a project that has developed a collaboration between groups in all three of the major research universities in the State of Kansas, and promises to lead to a collaborative program that covers the major aspects of composite development and application. Sherwood has provided initial fiber surface treatment and sizing together with fiber and composite <b>surface</b> analysis; <b>Lease,</b> Tomblin and Wang have worked together toward the goal of preparing pre-preg and fabrication of laminated panels; Locke has developed computational models to evaluate the effect of surface treatment (and chemistry) on mechanical properties; Lease, Tomblin and Wang have worked together to perform all necessary mechanical testing. The research has been focused on materials that would benefit the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) program. The group has visited Dr. Howard Maars and his colleagues at NASA Langley, and has focused their studies on the NASA requirements discussed in this meeting. An important development, requested by NASA scientists, has been the acquisition and study of K 3 B as a matrix material for the composites. The project has led to the successful acquisition and surface analysis of K 3 B, together with the successful deposition of this material onto surface oxidized carbon fibers. Mechanical testing, modelling and the construction of composite preparation equipment has been achieved during the grant period...|$|R
40|$|What {{were some}} of the major issues {{addressed}} in the 2010 Legislature? Water, fences, wind energy and the state budget. What happened with water? The main bill was LB 862, which extends the $ 10 /acre irrigated acre tax to all Natural Resource Districts (NRDs) that are preparing an integrated water management plan. Formerly, this authority had been extended only to Republican Basin NRDs, but the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that limitation unconstitutional. The Unicameral also repealed the water checkoff on corn and sorghum, and opened up the integrated management plan process to all NRDs. LB 862 may help NRDs get closer to where they need to be in the Republican Basin. Will this fix everything in the Republican Basin? Bill LB 862 is a big step in the right direction. The $ 10 /acre tax will likely be challenged in court, so that may cause a delay.

The tribe shall have a depletion right of 10, 000 acre-feet of water annually from the Green River with a priority of Oct. 3, 1861 for M&I purposes. This amount shall include reserved rights for domestic, municipal industrial or related uses. No water allocated pursuant to this Compact shall be subject to loss or forfeiture. It may be used for any purpose. It may be sourced in ground or <b>surface</b> water. <b>Leasing</b> is allowed. Any state water rights acquired by the Tribe for land to which a reserved right is recognized herein shall be forfeited. Practicably irrigable acreages include (1) tribal lands and individual Indian allotments; (2) Uintah Indian Irrigation Project lands, which include tribal lands, allotments, and some private lands which were originally allotted lands; and (3) lands distributed to former tribal members terminated under the Ute Partition Act, 3, 1861, and for municipal and industrial purposes, which shall be diverted from the Green River. The total acreage under or susceptible to irrigation is as 129, 201 acres, reduced by 7 % to 120, 157 acres to reflect roads, yards, fences, rights-of-way, and other non-productive lands. All lands are in the Uintah Reservation. The tribe may acquire additional state law water rights. UT has general administrative supervision of any water up to points of diversion from the main source. The US & the Tribe shall have general administrative supervision of waters within the canal systems. The US & Tribe do not need to make application to the State to change place of use when change to place is on the same canal system. The parties agree to expedite the development of water projects for group 5 lands under the Central Utah Project. [Source: [URL]...|$|R
