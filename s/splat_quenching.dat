Both 11 B-NMR and vibrational spectroscopy show a slightly higher fraction of trigonal over tetrahedral borate groups in glass samples which are <b>splat</b> <b>quenched</b> from a final melting temperature of 1750 °C than that in carefully annealed samples. Regarding the medium-range order structure, a more mixed silicate-borate network reflected by a higher fraction of B–O-Si bonds characterizes the quenched sample, while more homopolar B-O-B and Si-O-Si bonds {{are found in the}} annealed sample. The direct analysis of the B-O-Si linkages by 2 D 11 B/ 29 Si NMR correlation confirms this conclusion.

In these melts Fe^ -ion may be an amphoteric ion, that is, the oxygen coordination number of Fe^ is 4 and/or 6 (Fe^ (4) and/or Fe^ (6). Fe^ (4) forms a complex anion with oxygen such as Si^, and Fe^ (6) acts as a cation. Effects of Na_ 2 O and RO-content on the physical properties of ferrite melts have been discussed in term of the ratio of Fe^ (4) and Fe^ (6). The controlling factors of Fe^ (4) /Fe^ (6) ratio are the basicity and content of alkali, alkaliearth oxides.

40|$|Fabrication of a {{preliminary}} continuous Sigma 1140 + SiC fibre reinforced MoSi 2 composite monotape by plasma spraying onto a ring shaped substrate {{has been successfully}} demonstrated without any SiC breakage. The MoSi 2 matrix microstructure was typical of a <b>splat</b> <b>quenched</b> plasma spray processed material with porosity < 5 %. Matrix cracking occurred between fibres and was attributed primarily to differences in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of MoSi 2, SiC and the steel substrate. Evidence for the formation of SiC by interfacial reaction between the fibre C coating and the MoSi 2 matrix has been observed, although this reaction was not uniform at all points on the interface. SIC formation has been suggested to affect the bonding between the fibre and the matrix and the subsequent mechanical properties of consolidated material. Pest oxidation bf the MoSi 2 matrix has been used to extract the SiC fibres after plasma spraying to assess the effect of process induced damage on the fiber properties in the matrix. However, the extraction process itself caused some changes to fibre properties which made analysis problematical. The similar to 3. 1 GPa as-supplied mean tensile fibre strength was retained during plasma spraying, but the Weibull modulus reduced from 25 to 11, i. e. the spread of fibre strengths increased. Mean bend strain and Weibull modulus were reduced from 1. 78 to 1. 57 and from 25 to 10 respectively. The fibre surface integrity was affected by both oxidation effects during extraction and by the impact of MoSi 2 droplets during spraying. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

The powders are small, uniform in size, nonagglomerated, highly pure and of controlled crystallinity; all parameters considered ideal for fabrication of defect-free ceramic parts. The unique and uniform time-temperature histories achievable with laser heating permit these important characteristics to be realized. Dispersions of Si powders {{have been made}} and characterized extensively. These results have defined an appropriate strategy for making concentrated dispersions and have confirmed earlier preliminary results. Zeta-potential and photon correlation spectrometry {{have been used to}} study the effects of water contamination in the alcohol dispersants. Based on current results, we believe that concentrated dispersions will be achieved with steric rather than coulombic stabilization. Coulombic repulsive forces are effective only with dilute dispersions. Manufacturing cost analysis shows that submicron powders can be made at lower cost with gas phase processes than with comminution proceses. The laser heat source does not contribute significantly to the total costs. Total manufacturing costs are dominated by even lower than present actual feed stock (SiH[subscript 4]) costs. Recent cost reductions indicate that acceptable SIH[subscript 4] costs may be realized soon. Surface tensions of Al[subscript 2] 0 [subscript 3] based melts with MgO, Cr[subscript 2] 0 [subscript 3], Ti 0 [subscript 2] and ZrO[subscript 2] additives have been measured In neutral, oxidizing and reducing atmospheres.

50|$|The {{formation}} of a non-crystalline form of a gold-silicon alloy by the method of <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> from the melt led to further considerations {{of the influence of}} electronic structure on glass forming ability, based on the properties of the metallic bond.

One claim against such a model is that if chemical bonds are important, the nearly free electron models should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge distribution between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.|$|E
