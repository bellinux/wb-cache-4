5|$|Move is {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be a {{departure}} from the modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), intending to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it offered them more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card that reads Roberts' name and the track title is shown. As the title changes color, Roberts walks and skips down a New York City street wearing a floral T-shirt dress. Effects are placed on Roberts' with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her {{movement}} with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent, and during the second verse Roberts performs a short dance movement with two back-up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it, which also changes to multiple neon colours. As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the same effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts {{walking out of the}} frame before the camera moves upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E
25|$|Devil's Due Publishing and Image Comics {{introduced}} new elements into Snake Eyes' past {{during their}} Snake Eyes Declassified miniseries, which <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Cobra Commander's motivation to kill Snake Eyes while training {{to become a}} ninja. Snake Eyes had an encounter with Cobra Commander prior {{to the formation of}} Cobra, where Cobra Commander befriended Snake Eyes and tried to recruit him into murdering a judge. The judge had convicted Cobra Commander's older brother of arson and insurance fraud, resulting in the ruin of his brother's life, causing his spiral downward into alcoholism, and ultimately the car accident that claimed both his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Snake Eyes agreed to accompany Cobra Commander, but at the last minute refused {{to go along with the}} plan. Cobra Commander then killed the judge, and swore revenge against Snake Eyes, resulting in him hiring Firefly (who in turn subcontracted Zartan) to kill Snake Eyes while he was training with the Arashikage Clan.|$|E

500|$|Freak Show saw {{the band}} <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their own musical style, rather than copying others, and thus {{received}} more praise for its songwriting than its predecessor. Yahoo! Music's Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as [...] "moving" [...] and [...] "emotional". Johns' vocal delivery was complemented: his [...] "bittersweet, crackly voice tops the ample power chordage ... hits shivery, emotional notes that convey both sweet idealism and disappointment". Zuel felt {{that with this}} album, the band [...] "have outgrown the jokes, predictions and their own understated teenage ambitions to find they have become (gasp!) career musicians." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the fourth}} and fifth episode, Moffat planned a two-part sequel to his 2007 episode [...] "Blink", which {{featured}} the Weeping Angels. These two episodes, [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone", were intended to be a more action-oriented than [...] "Blink", and also showed the Angels had a plan rather than scavenging. He also decided to flesh out the Angels as villains themselves and <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what they can do. [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] ends with Amy attempting to seduce the Doctor; Moffat believed this was consistent with the character that had been built up from the first episode.|$|E
500|$|His {{portrayal}} in The Movie {{has also}} received praise: IGN's Andy Patrizio said that Spike [...] "opens up his soul a little" [...] during the film, while Chris Beveridge of Mania.com found Spike more likable {{in the film}} than {{in some parts of}} the series, comparing him to Lupin III and praising the moments where he could be himself and <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his inner self. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Review said that Spike's portrayal was one of the things that worked in the film, and DVD Talk's Neil Lumbard, alongside general praise of the characters, positively noted the further exploration of his personality. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol was less enthusiastic, saying that while Spike was the only one who got much attention during the film, some sequences felt like they could work without him.|$|E

500|$|Yancey was {{inspired}} to write What's So Amazing About Grace? after President Bill Clinton asked him, [...] "Why do Christians hate so much?" [...] Although Yancey initially intended to call the book What's So Amazing About Grace: and Why Don't Christians <b>Show</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> It?, Zondervan, its publisher, objected to this title despite the author's contention that he wrote the book to communicate the belief that grace {{is one of the}} best quality Christians, like himself, have to offer but are not necessarily identified with it. The book was successful at secular and Christian stores, selling more than 15million copies by 2006 and becoming Yancey's best-known book. In it, Yancey coined the phrase [...] "scandal of grace", referring to the idea that God forgives some of the worst people, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle.|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{researched}} {{the subject of}} grace, asking non-Christians what they associated with Evangelical Christianity. None of their responses mentioned grace; most cited political stances, such as opposition to LGBT rights and abortion. The author initially intended to call his book What's So Amazing About Grace: and Why Don't Christians <b>Show</b> <b>More</b> <b>of</b> It? Zondervan, its eventual publisher, objected to the title's forcefulness, despite Yancey's argument that he wrote the book about how [...] "we Christians are simply not known by the greatest gift we have". On February 3, 1997, Christianity Today published an essay by Yancey, the magazine's editor-at-large, with the title [...] "A State of Ungrace", {{saying that it was}} the basis of two chapters of Yancey's upcoming book with the working title of What's So Amazing About Grace and Why the World Needs More of It. The book was published later that year with the shorter title What's So Amazing About Grace? ...|$|E
500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E

500|$|In a 1998 Presbyterian Record review, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway {{writes that}} What's So Amazing About Grace? made him [...] "thankful afresh for God's grace and {{challenged}} {{to live a}} life reflecting it". Callaway was haunted by Yancey's question, [...] "If grace is so amazing, why don't Christians <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] and expressed his appreciation to the author at the 1998 Christian Booksellers Association convention. When he asked Yancey why he wrote the book, the author answered: [...] "I long for the church to become a culture of grace... A graceful church knows how to welcome failure and rewards vulnerability so that a person automatically thinks of the church when needing help." [...] Yancey asked Callaway if he thought the book would generate controversy, and Callaway said it would. Callaway asked Yancey why his book was so harsh in its description of Christians, and Yancey responded, [...] "I'm picking on Christians because I am one". Yancey said that he knew many gracious Christians and that secular culture was filled with examples of ungrace, including media manipulation of body image and the belief that [...] "there ain't {{no such thing as a}} free lunch", which contradicts the concept of undeserved grace from God as taught in Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Move was Third Day's {{first record}} without guitarist Brad Avery, {{who left the}} band after the {{recording}} of their previous album (Revelation). After he left the group, the band felt they were at a musical crossroads; although they considered replacing Avery, they ultimately decided not to. After playing a few concerts without Avery, Third Day felt they needed to step it up musically. The band's induction into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame also served as inspiration for the record. Although the band {{felt that they had}} previously reined in sounds that were too southern rock in sound, they decided to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their southern roots in the record. Bassist Tai Anderson said that although Third Day felt Revelation was a [...] "career record" [...] for them, they felt they [...] "just couldn't just make 'Revelation Part II.' It needed to feel different". The band chose to record the album in their own studio, which they felt offered more creative freedom than their previous recording process in Los Angeles. The also opted to work with producer Paul Moak, whom the band ultimately developed a good chemistry with. All the songs on Move were either written or co-written by Mac Powell.|$|E
500|$|Elsie Kelly played Angela's mother Maggie, {{on whose}} {{birthday}} the episode is set. The part was not written with anyone in mind, though Pemberton already knew Kelly well from {{their time together}} on the sitcom Benidorm. Lorraine Ashbourne played Angela's sister Carol, and Pat, Carol's husband, was played by Shearsmith. Carol was Pemberton's favourite character in the whole series; Shearsmith worried that an actor may not portray the character as they had hoped, but was very happy with Ashbourne's performance. Ashbourne said she was [...] "thrilled" [...] {{to be working with}} Pemberton and Shearsmith, for whom she had great admiration. She described the character of Carol as [...] "hilarious", characterising her as [...] "sexually frustrated" [...] and [...] "sad". To reflect Carol's alcoholism, Ashbourne swilled whiskey around her mouth before filming. Shearsmith wore a red wig to play Pat, something he had never done before. His skin-tone needed to be changed to match the hair, necessitating a white spray on his face every morning. In order not {{to give the impression that}} Pat was a thief or murderer (rather than simply a practical joker), Shearsmith was directed to chuckle while Pat set up his jokes. Christopher Whitlow plays a paramedic seen at the beginning and end of the episode. The scene featuring the paramedic at the end of the episode was longer in the final cut than had been initially intended in order to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the character's actions.|$|E

500|$|A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was {{launched}} on several websites in early November 2010. The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing I want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
50|$|Caress of Steel is {{the third}} studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, {{released}} in 1975. The album <b>shows</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Rush's adherence to hard progressive rock, {{as opposed to the}} blues-based hard rock style of the band's first album.|$|R

5000|$|... "Calling" [...] is {{the first}} single {{released}} from Taproot's third studio album Blue-Sky Research. Like most of the songs on the album, it is significantly less heavy than their previous singles, and <b>shows</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a standard alternative rock/post-grunge approach.|$|R
500|$|Tom's exit {{allowed the}} writers {{to pull the}} focus on the other characters, namely Danny and Zoe, to give the <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an {{ensemble}} feel. Overall, the producers made the third series more character driven. Raymond Khoury felt that because the length of a Spooks episode is one and half times longer than the average American television episode, the writers could use the extra time to flesh out the characters. Khoury also noted another difference between Spooks and American television is that most American seasons usually consists of 22 episodes, much of those episodes are more plot driven, while Spooks series three only had 10 and hence all of them contain some character development. The main character developments include Zoe's relationship with Will, which Danny did not like because {{he was in love with}} her. The writers initially wanted to expand on the potential Danny and Sam Buxton relationship which began in the second series, but the idea was dropped in favour of his affection towards Zoe, as the producers believed that was delivering more. Harry was given more depth by introducing his estranged daughter in [...] "Who Guards the Guards?". Through the daughter's introduction, Harry would appear more human as opposed to the boss who [...] "barks orders" [...] to his officers. When Hawes announced she wanted to leave, Richards decided to write a [...] "big episode" [...] to give Zoe a decent send off. Richards did not want to kill off the character, as he deemed it predictable. Oyelowo eventually decided to leave the series as well between filming episodes four and five; by then the finale was not yet written. The actor wanted Danny to be killed off, reasoning that since Tom and Zoe left as disgraced officers, having Danny leave a disgraced officer also would be [...] "one time too many" [...] for a series that is meant to second guess the audience. In addition, Oyelowo did not want the [...] "lingering thought" [...] of a possible return. The producers wanted to use Danny's death as a powerful end to the series.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there are}} stunt {{people on the}} sets for each episode, the cast is {{more than willing to}} take on some of the stunt-work themselves. Welling and Schneider {{performed}} a lot of their own stunts for the scene where Clark and Jonathan, who now has the powers to take on his son, battle over Clark’s use of the red kryptonite in [...] "Exile". This lent to the filmmakers being able to <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the two actor’s faces during the scene, which also lends more realism to the audience. As part of the opening scene for [...] "Extinction", which involved Lana being attacked in the school pool, Kreuk spent thirteen hours in the water as they filmed the scene.|$|E
2500|$|In Bryant's second season, he {{received}} more playing time {{and began to}} <b>show</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant's point averages more than doubled from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers [...] "played small", which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up. Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award, and through fan voting, he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history. He was joined by teammates O'Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making {{it the first time}} since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant's 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.|$|E
5000|$|Musically, {{the album}} <b>showed</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a slant towards thrash metal than {{hardcore}} punk as their popularity grew, {{although they did}} include a cover version of [...] "Commando" [...] by The Ramones to tip a nod to their punk rock roots.|$|R
50|$|El País del Humo ("Country of the Smoke")(1977) was a {{collection}} of her short stories, and literary sketches that <b>showed</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her fantastical side that had formerly appeared more in her children’s books.
