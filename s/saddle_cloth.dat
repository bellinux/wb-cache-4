500|$|The colt {{arrived at}} Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was {{flown in from}} California, his first time on a plane, and {{traveled}} quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation. [...] Upon arrival at Churchill Downs, the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth</b> to wear while exercising on the track, identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name. [...] The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error, with California misspelled as [...] "Califorina". He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling. Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake, but Sherman's strategy was backed by Lukas. [...] In {{the days leading up}} to the race, California Chrome galloped on the track, was walked in the saddling paddock, and schooled at the starting gate. Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track, saying [...] "he never actually felt comfortable on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chauvel {{inspected}} the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{while they were}} at Tel el Marakeb in August. [...] "The bearers, all smartly dressed, stood in line, with their saddle cloths {{spread out on the}} sand in front of them. On each <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth,</b> in similar positions, lay each man’s full equipment of about 25 separate items, all cleaned and polished up to the nines—saddles, stirrups and irons, bridles and bits, water bottles, feed bags, greatcoats, saddle bags, dixies, etc. etc." [...] On Friday 17 August, the Division moved back to El Fukhan. [...] "Six men on leave to Port Said." [...] The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade arrived at Tel el Marakeb the next day for a fortnight on the beach before they returned to El Fukhari near Tel el Fara.|$|E
50|$|The {{photograph}} {{above left}} shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865-860 BC. At this time, {{the men had}} no spurs, <b>saddles,</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> or stirrups. Fighting {{from the back of}} a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths</b> as primitive <b>saddles,</b> allowing each archer to control his own horse.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to clothing, wool {{has been used}} for blankets, horse rugs, <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.|$|R
50|$|In 1834, the guidons of {{the light}} cavalry (Light Dragoons, Lancers and Hussars) were {{withdrawn}} {{in order to improve}} the mobility of these regiments. Until they were restored (in a purely ceremonial role) by King George VI in 1952, these regiments displayed their honours on their officers' <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> their drums, drum banners and other appointments.|$|R
2500|$|The North Iranian Eurasian nomads {{known in}} Europe as Scythians and in Asia as Saka {{developed}} an early form of saddle with a rudimentary frame, which included two parallel leather cushions, with girth attached to them, a pommel and cantle with detachable bone/horn/hardened leather facings, leather thongs, a crupper, breastplate, and a felt shabrack [...] adorned with animal motifs. [...] These {{were located in}} Pazyryk burials finds. [...] These saddles, found in the Ukok Plateau, Siberia were dated to 500-400 BC. Iconographic evidence of a predecessor to the modern saddle {{has been found in}} the art of the ancient Armenians, Assyrians, and steppe nomads depicted on the Assyrian stone relief carvings from the time of Ashurnasirpal II. The Scythians also developed an early saddle that included padding and decorative embellishments. Though they had neither a solid tree nor stirrups, these early treeless saddles and pads provided protection and comfort to the rider, with a slight increase in security. The Sarmatians also used a padded treeless early saddle, possibly as early as the seventh century, BC. and depictions of Alexander the Great depict a <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was my {{bay horse}} (cost me $140) that was shot. I also lost the little pony, my fine saddle and bridle, {{and the common}} one. What I lost cost about $250. My <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth</b> which was about {{half the cost of}} the whole, I left at home.|$|E
60|$|Joan was {{keenly aware}} of the desperateness of the situation. The only way out was through. She lifted her riding-whip threateningly, and at the same moment drove in both spurs with her heels, rushing the startled horse {{straight}} at Gogoomy. It all happened in an instant. Every cane- knife was lifted, and every boy save Gogoomy leaped for her. He swerved aside to avoid the horse, at the same time swinging his cane-knife in a slicing blow that would have cut her in twain. She leaned forward under the flying steel, which cut through her riding-skirt, through the edge of the saddle, through the <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth,</b> and even slightly into the horse itself. Her right hand, still raised, came down, the thin whip whishing through the air. She saw the white, cooked mark of the weal clear across the sullen, handsome face, and still what was practically in the same instant she saw the man with the puckered face, overridden, go down before her, and she heard his snarling and grimacing chatter-for all the world like an angry monkey. Then she was free and away, heading the horse at top speed for the house.|$|E
50|$|Men hunted, traded {{and made}} war. The women had primary {{responsibility}} for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe); they gathered and cultivated plants, used plants and herbs to treat illnesses, cared for {{the young and the}} elderly, made all the clothing and instruments, and processed and cured meat and skins from the game. They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags, <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> and tepee covers. Mothers used cradleboards to carry an infant while working or traveling.|$|R
500|$|Beneath the saddle, caparisons or <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths</b> were {{sometimes}} worn; {{these could be}} decorated or embroidered with heraldic colours and arms. [...] War horses could be equipped with additional covers, blankets and armour collectively referred to as barding; this could be for decorative or protective purposes. [...] Early forms of horse armour, usually restricted to tournaments, comprised padded leather pieces, covered by a trapper (a decorated cloth), which was not particularly heavy. Mail and plate armour was also occasionally used; there are literary references to horse armour (an [...] "iron blanket") starting in the late 12th century.|$|R
60|$|About midnight we heard--delightful sound!--the {{murmur of}} the distant sea. Revived by the music, we pushed on more cheerily. At last the Donkey preceded us, and about 3 A.M. we found, in a Fiumara, some holes which {{supplied}} us with bitter water, truly delicious after fifteen hours of thirst. Repeated draughts of the element, which the late rains had rendered potable, relieved our pain, and hard by we found a place where coarse stubbly grass saved our mules from starvation. Then rain coming on, we coiled ourselves under the <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> and, reckless alike of Ayyal Ahmed and Ayyal Shirdon, slept like the dead.|$|R

60|$|Crowds of excited, {{shouting}} children ran chattering {{along the}} pavements. The colliers, as they tramped grey and heavy, in an intermittent stream uphill {{from the low}} grey west, stood on the pavement in wonder as the cavalcade approached and passed, jingling the silver bells of its trappings, vibrating the wonderful colours of the barred blankets and <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> the scarlet wool of the accoutrements, the bright tips of feathers. Women shrieked as Ciccio, in his war-paint, wheeled near the pavement. Children screamed and ran. The colliers shouted. Ciccio smiled in his terrifying war-paint, brandished his spear and trotted softly, like a flower on its stem, round to the procession.|$|R
5000|$|In the Melbourne Cup on November 4, Viewed {{defeated}} the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer {{in a photo}} finish. [...] The finish was so close that the electronic timing devices, which are placed inside the <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> recorded that Bauer had completed the course one-hundredth of a second faster than Viewed. [...] Viewed was trained by Bart Cummings and was ridden by Blake Shinn. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. [...] It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales.|$|R
5000|$|The emroidery {{styles of}} the Punjab region include the styles of Multani {{embroidery}} which features kalabatun [...] patterns using thin wires. This type of embroidery is also common {{in the rest of}} the Punjab region. Kalabatan surkh involves using gold wires on orange coloured and red silk. Kalabatan safed involves using silver wires on white material. There are two kinds of gold embroidery, one of a solid and rich kind called kar-chob and the other called tila-kar or kar-chikan utilising gold thread. The former is used for carpets and <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths</b> whereas the latter is used for dresses. The Punjab region also uses mukesh embroidery: mukesh bati-hui, twisted tinsel, mukesh gokru, flattened gold wire for embroidery of a heavy kind, and waved mukesh, made by crimping mukesh batihui with iron tongs.|$|R
50|$|The terms saddle blanket, {{saddle pad}} (or numnah), and <b>saddle</b> <b>cloth</b> refer to blankets, pads or fabrics {{inserted}} under a saddle.

60|$|Midday. A roam in a Moorish castle. A divan seat runs {{round the}} {{dilapidated}} adobe walls, which are partly painted, partly faced with white tiles patterned in green and yellow. The ceiling {{is made up}} of little squares, painted in bright colors, with gilded edges, and ornamented with gilt knobs. On the cement floor are mattings, sheepskins, and leathern cushions with geometrical patterns on them. There is a tiny Moorish table in the middle; and at it a huge <b>saddle,</b> with <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths</b> of various colors, showing that the room is used by foreigners accustomed to chairs. Anyone sitting at the table in this seat would have the chief entrance, a large horseshoe arch, on his left, and another saddle seat between him and the arch; whilst, if susceptible to draughts, he would probably catch cold from a little Moorish door in the wall behind him to his right.|$|R

60|$|Without {{returning}} the salutations of the Bedouins, who loudly summoned {{us to stop}} {{and give them the}} news, we trotted forwards in search of a deserted sheep-fold. At sunset we passed, upon an eminence on our left, the ruins of an ancient settlement, called after its patron Saint, Ao Barhe: and both sides of the mountain road were flanked by tracts of prairie-land, beautifully purpling in the evening air. After a ride of thirty-five miles, we arrived at a large fold, where, by removing the inner thorn-fences, we found fresh grass for our starving beasts. The night was raw and windy, and thick mists deepened into a drizzle, which did not quench our thirst, but easily drenched the <b>saddle</b> <b>cloths,</b> our only bedding. In one sense, however, the foul weather was propitious to us. Our track might easily have been followed by some enterprising son of Yunis Jibril; these tracts of thorny bush are favourite places for cattle lifting; moreover the fire was kept blazing all night, yet our mules were not stolen.|$|R

Nasal strips are not considered performance-enhancing, but may reduce airway resistance, lower the risk of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), and aid post-race recovery.
