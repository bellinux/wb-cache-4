30|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{prognosis}} of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies has dramatically improved, and admission to the ICU is now viewed as a bridge to cure rather than a terminal process. The reasons for this trend are multiple, including general improvements in the prognosis of cancer, better and early identification of patients likely to benefit from intensive care and advances in the management of acute life-threatening disorders [18]. However, severe infections resulting in shock and/or acute respiratory failure represent dreaded complications in cancer patients and still account for a large number of deaths regardless of the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy.</b> It is clear that cancer patients already benefited from advances in the field of sepsis, but it remains a major area for improvement for this vulnerable population. Nevertheless, such immunocompromised patients were either underrepresented or even excluded from the leading clinical trials in severe sepsis and septic shock. Whether they are entitled to strictly similar management as non-immunocompromised patients is questionable.|$|E
40|$|Malignancy is an {{important}} cause of mortality and morbidity after solid organ transplantations. In a recent study {{it was estimated that}} more than 1 in 5 renal transplant recipients will develop malignancy within 15 years, and this incidence will further increase after 20 years (London et al., (1995). In renal transplant recipients the most prevalent neoplasms are not the cancers of the colon, breast, or lung that are commonly observed in general population. Rather, uncommon tumors like Kaposi’s sarcoma, vulvar/anal carcinomas, lip and hepatocellular carcinoma, in situ cervix carcinomas are frequently observed (Penn, 1998). We have observed a large number of malignancies in our renal transplant patients over 30 years experience(Table 1). Advanced <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy,</b> multiple site involvement or early relapse after treatments are the main discouraging factors that contribute to decreased survival of persons with grafts.

No changes in any of the monitored coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters were noted in the other treatment groups, including patients on maintenance estrogen therapy. The results of this study show that only high-dose estrogen therapy is accompanied by a selective decrease in AT-III activity.

Purpose: Oral squamous carcinoma (OSCC) cells exhibit resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-mediated apoptosis {{in the late}} <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy.</b> Increased levels of heat shock proteins 70 (HSP 70) in cancer cells are known to confer resistance to apoptosis.

Results: While YD- 9 cells showed high resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide and 5 -fluorouraci (5 -FU), HSP 70 antisense oligonucelotides sensitized chemoresistant YD- 9 cells to etoposide and 5 -FU.

40|$|Abstract Background Both urinary bilharziasis and urothelial {{neoplasia}} {{are associated}} with increased production of tissue carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Patients and methods Urine and serum CEA were determined in 43 patients with urinary bladder carcinoma including 22 post bilharzial and 21 nonbiharzial cases, in addition to 10 normal control cases. Results A significant increase was detected in both urine and serum CEA levels with bladder carcinoma compared to control cases. Urinary CEA was significantly elevated in 86 % of bilharzial, versus 62 % in nonbilharzial bladder carcinoma. Only 10. 5 % of control cases had urinary CEA elevation. The mean urinary CEA in bilharzial, was {{higher than that of}} nonbilharzial carcinoma, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was a definite relationship between urine CEA and the stage of malignancy; the higher the stage, the higher the level of urine CEA. No relationship could be detected between the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy</b> and serum CEA, or between the grades of malignancy and urine or serum CEA levels. Conclusion Urinary CEA is more useful than serum CEA in the early detection of urotherlial carcinoma particularly if provoked by bilharziasis.

40|$|Abstract — The need to {{determine}} the behavior of cell colonies in cultures often arises in controlled biological experiments. The deployment of microassays involving multiple wells allows the assessment of parameters such as the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy,</b> growth constraints and chemical concentrations etc. The large amount of preprocessed data negates the use of manual counting methods and requires automatic image analysis algorithms. In this work, we determine the clonal growth patterns in mutated cell lines {{as part of a}} drug development study. After suitable preprocessing, individual cells are segmented out in each frame independently. In a given frame, the cells are grouped into clonal colonies by estimating their geodesic distance to colony boundaries available in the previous frame. The geodesic distance metric is defined using the statistical 2 -point correlation functions (2 -pcfs). Therefore, we progressively track the clonal colony growth in an Eulerian framework by utilizing cell segmentations in conjunction with the 2 -pcfs. We report our results on sample culture cells and validate the same with manual measurements.

40|$|Summary: Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) has be-come a critical diagnostic {{tool in the}} discovery and <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancies</b> {{in the head and}} neck. Although PET is accurate for detecting cancer, increased 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake can be seen in healthy tissues such as muscle, fat, and glands and uptake can be seen in tissues affected by inflammation or granulomatous disease. Com-bined PET and CT (PET/CT) can often overcome these difficulties by fusing anatomic and physiological data, but radiographic findings of some disease processes can be confusing even with fused imaging techniques. We present two cases of FDG uptake in the posterior pharynx, localized by combined PET/CT, which was initially interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma.

40|$|Introduction. Chronic lymphedema, mainly due {{to total}} mastectomy with {{axillary}} lymph nodes dissection for breast cancer, can induce development of rare and highly malignant cutaneous angiosarcoma. This condition is called Stewart-Treves syndrome (STS). There {{are only about}} 400 cases of STS reported in the literature. The long-term prognosis is poor; 5 -year survival is up to 10 %. Limb amputation {{appears to be the}} treatment of choice. Objective. To present a case of Stewart-Treves syndrome with a fatal outcome, which developed 12 years after mastectomy with lymphadenectomy. Case report. A  65 -year-old woman was admitted to our department for confluent purpuric macules, hemorrhagic blisters, and violaceous-black nodules, involving the whole left arm and forearm, with chronic severe lymphedema of the extremity. She had a history of left-sided breast cancer 12 years previously, treated with mastectomy with excision of axillary lymph nodes; subsequently, the failure of lymph drainage and lymph stasis developed. Histopathological examination of the tumor was consistent with angiosarcoma.

40|$|Desmoglein 3 is one {{of seven}} desmosomal cadherins that mediate cell-cell {{adhesion}} in desmosomes. Desmosomes are the intercellular junctional complexes that anchor the intermediate filaments of adjacent cells and confer strong cell adhesion thus are essential in the maintenance of tissue architecture and structural integrity. Like adherens junctions, desmosomes function as tumour suppressors and are down regulated {{in the process of}} epithelial-mesenchymal transition and in tumour cell invasion and metastasis. However, recently several studies have shown that various desmosomal components, including desmoglein 3, are up-regulated in cancer with increased levels of expression correlating with the clinical <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>malignancy,</b> implicating their potentiality to serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that overexpression of desmoglein 3 in cancer cell lines activates several signal pathways that have an impact on cell morphology, adhesion and locomotion. These additional signalling roles of desmoglein 3 may not be associated to its adhesive function in desmosomes but rather function outside of the junctions, acting as a key regulator in the control of actin based cellular processes.
