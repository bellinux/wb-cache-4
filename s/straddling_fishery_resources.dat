40|$|Bali Strait has {{potential}} abundance of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> such as Indonesian oil sardine (lemuru), frigate mackerel (tongkol), scad mackerel (layang), short-bodied mackerel (kembung) and others {{which can be}} caught mostly using purse seine. <b>Fishery</b> <b>resources</b> are combined and also known asmultispecies; therefore this research aimed to analyze the model of bio-economic multispecies exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait. The analytical methods that used in this research were estimated dynamic model of Walters and Hilborn (1976) and analysis of bio-economic model. The results showed that actual production of exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait, was lower than the rate of sustainable production especially Indonesian oil sardine and short-bodied mackerel. Production and fishing effort were below the actual optimal value. The management of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait did not show a good level of economic efficiency. Thus the exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait using purse seine could still be increased...|$|R

40|$|Past rivalry over {{access to}} water has usually been between the farmers who irrigate and new agricultural, industrial, and {{municipal}} demands. Recently, the recreational demand for water has become another consideration in water allocation decisions. We examine {{the significance of the}} recreational demand for water as a <b>fishery</b> <b>resource</b> by applying two different frameworks to the decision to fish. The consistency of the estimated responses to changes in <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> across both decision frameworks testifies to the importance of streams as a recreational <b>fishery</b> <b>resource.</b> Modeling behavior within the household production framework allows all downstream effects to be estimated, not just impacts at particular sites. Marginal values of water as a recreational <b>fishery</b> <b>resource</b> are estimated based on day values of fishing derived in prior research...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of the advance of property rights in fisheries upon the management of internationally shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> The management of these shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> did, in fact, come to prominence because of a revolutionary advance in state property rights to <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> through the advent of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regime. The revolution in state property rights to <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> is not yet complete, however. The incompleteness of the revolution, it is argued, creates serious difficulties for the effective management for an important class of shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources,</b> namely <b>straddling</b> and highly migratory fish stocks. The paper then discusses the impact, actual and potential, of the development of private property rights in fisheries upon the management of these resources. The discussion is speculative, however, and can be no more than that until there has been further advances in the game theoretic analysis of shared fish stock management.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> management  at the Karimunjawa National Park (KNP) is a {{very complicated}} effort. One of the serious issues is that the national park was declared by government when it has been inhabited by fisherfolk community.

Results of model analysis SEM showed that fisherfolk perception on sustainable <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> management at KNP expect: (1) surveillance efforts, (2) commitment on law enforcement, and (3) involvement of fisherfolk participation.

40|$|The {{principle}} behind community based {{fisheries management}} is handover of <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> to community groups {{and they will}} manage the resources sustainably and equitably. The benefits of this approach are obvious [...] it is pro-poor, equitable and sustainable. Handing over fisheries management to community groups secures access to <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> for those people whose lives depend on them i. e. the poor fishers. This ensures a pro-poor approach supportive of the national goal of poverty alleviation. In addition to this, by {{making sure that the}} best fisheries do not forever end up with the few local elites, community managed fisheries guarantees equitable distribution of benefits from <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources.</b> The lives of some millions of people are dependent on <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> and they must be allowed to enjoy the benefits from these resources. Moreover, unlike the current revenue based system of fisheries management, community managed fisheries approach is not driven by the overarching desire for profit. As a result, community groups responsible for managing <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> balance the need for production with conservation which results in sustainability. A brief comparison of the approaches adopted for fisheries management (presented in the following tabular form) clearly demonstrates the advantages of community managed fisheries approach...|$|R

Questionnaires were used to obtain desired information which was divided into 2 categories: middle level/technical and management officers. A total sample size of 105 respondents in the study area was taken using exhaustive sampling technique fort he institutions and random sampling technique to choose respondents within institutions where the sample population was found to be high (n> 30).
