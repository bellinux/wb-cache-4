Initially rated at 360 hp for 1958, the Super Marauder engine option package allowed any Mercury with the 430 to {{increase}} its output to 400 hp (the first mass-production engine in an American automobile to be rated at 400 hp). For 1959, the Super Marauder was discontinued, with the <b>standard</b> <b>engine</b> <b>rated</b> at 345 hp, retuned to 310 hp in 1960.
