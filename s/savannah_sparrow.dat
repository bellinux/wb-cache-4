40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{function}} of acoustic signals in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> Passerculus) sandwichensis, by analyzing temporal variation in vocal activity, and by conducting a playback experiment. In my first data chapter, I analyze longUterm acoustic recordings to study diel and seasonal variation in vocal activity of <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> I show that singing activity of male <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> varies with time of day, time of year, and breeding stage. Males exhibit {{the highest level of}} song output in May, upon arrival on the breeding grounds, and the lowest level in August, before departure from the breeding grounds. Song output peaks in the early morning, consistent with dawn chorus behaviour, but this pattern is common only prior to pairing; after pairing the dawn chorus is reduced and male song output peaks in the evening, consistent with dusk chorus behaviour. These patterns suggest that dawn choruses serve a territorial function whereas dusk choruses serve a femaleUrelated function in <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows.</b> In my second data chapter, I present the results of a playback experiment designed to test whether <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> signal their intention to attack a rival male. I simulated an intruder using song playback and a taxidermic model, and explored which behaviors were associated with physical attack. <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> produce soft songs and chip calls at significantly higher levels before attacking rivals, whereas three other measured behaviors (aggressive calls, wing waving, and passes over the model) do not predict attack. My research advances the field of animal communication and provides a foundation for future research on signal function and social interactions involving vocal signals...|$|R

40|$|In Louisiana and Texas DRC-l 339 treated {{brown rice}} {{is used to}} manage {{blackbird}} populations that cause severe damage to newly planted rice. Non-target bird species have been observed on some DRC- 1339 bait sites. We conducted dietary toxicity tests to provide additional data on the toxicity of DRC-l 339 to the following non-target species observed on DRC- 1339 bait sites: <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passerculus sandwichensis), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), snow geese (Chen caerulescens), mourning doves (Zenarda macroura), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), and American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea). During our 5 -day DRC- 1339 dietary test; in which birds were fed only 2 % DRC-l 339 -treated brown rice diluted 1. 25 with untreated brown rice, no mortality occurred to Canada geese or snow geese, and 1 mortality occurred to <b>savannah</b> <b>sparrows.</b> Nine of 10 mourning doves, 8 of 9 meadow larks and 8 of 10 American tree sparrows died during the same test. Most test species exhibited some degree of aversion to the DRC- 1339 bait, indicating that in free-feeding situations such as DRC- 1339 air sites most non-target birds might ingest sublethal doses and subsequently avoid treated baits. Rapid degradation and discoloration of DRC- 1339 baits reduce the risk for non-target species at DRC- 1339 bait sites...|$|R

50|$|Several large bird colonies are resident, {{including}} the Arctic tern and Ipswich sparrow, a subspecies of the <b>Savannah</b> <b>sparrow</b> which breeds {{only on the}} island.

50|$|The island {{especially}} provides important habitat to many guilds {{of birds}} including: seabirds, shorebirds, marshbirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors. During the summer, {{large numbers of}} double-crested cormorants, Virginia rails and various songbirds (<b>Savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> and common yellowthroats) rely on the island for nesting habitat. In addition, Leach's storm-petrels have been confirmed nesting on the Island since 2002 (one of only two sites where this species nests in Massachusetts). During the fall migration, numerous species of raptors (such as peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks) and neotropical migrants use the island as feeding and resting habitat.|$|R
40|$|In {{the northeastern}} United States, {{grassland}} birds regularly use agricultural fields as nesting habitat. However, birds that nest in these fields regularly experience nest failure {{as a result}} of agricultural practices, such as mowing and grazing. Therefore, information on both spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use is needed to effectively manage these species. We addressed these complex habitat use patterns by conducting point counts during three time intervals between May 21, 2002 and July 2, 2002 in agricultural fields across the Champlain Valley in Vermont and New York. Early in the breeding season, Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) used fields in which the landscape within 2500 m was dominated by open habitats. As mowing began, suitable habitat within 500 m became more important. <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Passerculus sandwichensis) initially used fields that contained a high proportion of suitable habitat within 500 m. After mowing, features of the field (i. e., size and amount of woody edge) became more important. Each species responded differently to mowing: <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> were equally abundant in mowed and uncut fields, whereas Bobolinks were more abundant in uncut fields. In agricultural areas in the Northeast, large areas (2000 ha) that are mostly nonforested and undeveloped should be targeted for conservation. Within large open areas, smaller patches (80 ha) should be maintained as high-quality, late-cut grassland habitat...|$|R
25|$|Migratory songbirds use the Earth’s {{magnetic}} field, stars, the Sun, {{and other}} unknown cues {{to determine their}} migratory direction. An American study suggested that migratory <b>Savannah</b> <b>sparrows</b> used polarised light from an area of sky near the horizon to recalibrate their magnetic navigation system at both sunrise and sunset. This suggested that skylight polarisation patterns are the primary calibration reference for all migratory songbirds. However, it appears that birds may be responding to secondary indicators of the angle of polarisation, {{and may not be}} actually capable of directly detecting polarisation direction in the absence of these cues.|$|R

40|$|Declining {{grassland}} {{breeding bird}} populations {{have led to}} increased efforts to assess habitat quality, typically by estimating density or relative abundance. Because some grassland habitats may function as ecological traps, a more appropriate metric for determining quality may be breeding success. Between 1994 and 2003 we gathered data on the nest fates of Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorous), and <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Passerculus sandwichensis) {{in a series of}} fallow fields and pastures/hayfields in western New York State. We calculated daily survival probabilities using the Mayfield method, and used the logistic-exposure method to model effects of predictor variables on nest success. Nest survival probabilities were 0. 464 for Eastern Meadowlarks (n = 26), 0. 483 for Bobolinks (n = 91), and 0. 585 for <b>Savannah</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (n = 152). Fledge dates for first clutches ranged between 14 June and 23 July. Only one obligate grassland bird nest was parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), for an overall brood parasitism rate of 0. 004. Logistic-exposure models indicated that daily nest survival probabilities were higher in pastures/hayfields than in fallow fields. Our results, and those from other studies in the Northeast, suggest that properly managed cool season grassland habitats in the region may not act as ecological traps, and that obligate grassland birds in the region may have greater nest survival probabilities, and lower rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism, than {{in many parts of the}} Midwest...|$|R
