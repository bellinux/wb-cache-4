5|$|Armley Mills {{was built}} in 1788 and is {{currently}} the largest woollen mill museum. There are <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of industrial architecture from {{the latter part of}} this era in Holbeck, Hunslet, Armley and areas surrounding Leeds city centre.|$|E
5|$|Bristol, {{the largest}} city in South West England, has an eclectic {{combination}} of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> have survived.|$|E
5|$|Interferometers {{are used}} in {{atmospheric}} physics for high-precision measurements of trace gases via remote sounding of the atmosphere. There are <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of interferometers that utilize either absorption or emission features of trace gases. A typical use would be in continual monitoring of the column concentration of trace gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide above the instrument.|$|E

5|$|Bristol has 51 Grade I, 500 Grade II* {{and over}} 3,800 Grade II listed {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of architectural styles, from medieval to modern. During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style unique to the city, was developed, and <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom {{can be seen in the}} city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period, and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, Hellenistic {{influence}} on Indian art was far-ranging. In {{the area of}} architecture, {{a few examples of}} the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. <b>Several</b> <b>examples</b> of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC. The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara, especially through Indo-Corinthian capitals.|$|E
5|$|His {{collection}} is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces {{dating from the}} 10th century. One example is a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the Kufic script – {{it is more than}} 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons.

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of string theory {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of academic, peer-reviewed {{research}} concerning {{different aspects}} of Magic: The Gathering. One example examined how players use their imaginations when playing. This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative. Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using {{a specific set of}} cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> from the Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while {{two have been}} left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set {{in what is now}} known as a steampunk environment. The structure of society parallels that of {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game, and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. Railroads and steamships are in use, and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe. Additionally, <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a chainsaw and drill) have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro. However, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{types and}} styles of {{ceramics}} {{have been found}} during the excavations at Gedi including Chinese porcelain, Islamic glazed ware, and locally produced earthenwares. <b>Several</b> <b>examples</b> of the ceramics recovered at Gedi are represented in different quantities at other coastal sites. Red slipped pottery is rare at Gedi, compared to other inland sites, while bowls with rounded bottoms, flat rims, and incised ornamentation {{on top of the}} rims are more common at Gedi. White to cream colored bowls were also found in small quantities, along with an isolated pottery type that has a golden brown luster. A sherd with a trellis pattern is a possible import from the African interior.|$|E

Disc 4 features the same 1987 show {{available on the}} 2-disc set. Disc five contains both the original album (again, remastered version from 2011), and the above listed 1987 show in hi-resolution audio.

5|$|While in Milan, Josquin wrote <b>several</b> <b>examples</b> of a {{new type}} of piece {{developed}} by the composers there, the motet-chanson. These compositions were texturally very similar to 15th century chansons in the formes fixes mold, except that unlike those completely secular works, they contained a chant-derived Latin cantus-firmus in the lowest of the three voices. The other voices, in French, sang a secular text which had either a symbolic relationship to the sacred Latin text, or commented on it. Josquin's three known motet-chansons, Que vous madame/In pace, A la mort/Monstra te esse matrem, and Fortune destrange plummaige/Pauper sum ego, are similar stylistically to those by the other composers of the Milan chapel, such as Loyset Compère and Alexander Agricola.|$|E
