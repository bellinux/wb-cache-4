5|$|After resigning {{from the}} Emory College faculty, Sledd entered the {{graduate}} school of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he began work in the advanced classics doctoral program, specializing in Latin. Sledd received $1,000 in <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> from Emory pursuant to an agreement with Dickey and unanimously approved by the Emory faculty, and his father-in-law contributed $900 to help cover his tuition and living expenses while he attended Yale. He received a scholarship from the university, and earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Latin from Yale in 1903, after only nine months. Stanford University and Syracuse University offered him professorships in Latin; Antioch College offered him its presidency. Sledd declined all offers from Northern and Western institutions, and was determined to return to his native South.|$|E
5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman {{into a public}} limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of the}} restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the full}} {{integration}} into the labour and social law regulations, holding part-time work in Austria is not a precarious situation for most employees. Generally, however, most problems arise in the future: In case of redundancy, unemployment benefits, <b>severance</b> <b>pays</b> and pension rates are lower in comparison to long-time full employment. Women in particular suffer in this context. The high part-time rate in combination with high divorce rates and the paternalistic orientation of the Austrian welfare state {{should be taken into}} account in this connection [5, 44]. Especially in Germany, {{against the backdrop of the}} Hartz IV reforms, non-standard forms of employment are criticised, as is part-time work. In statistical studies, all working contracts with 35  h or less are classified as part-time work. As a result, the variations of working hours are high, and differentiations between what is categorised under the term part-time work are essential.|$|R

5|$|In 1958, Eastwood {{was cast}} as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series Rawhide, the {{breakthrough}} {{in his career}} he had long been searching for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona {{in the summer of}} 1958. It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The Rawhide years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled {{in the middle of the}} 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of Rawhides cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as <b>severance</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{severance}} {{agreements and}} their relation with CEO turnover. Severance agreements provide an interesting {{exception to the}} pay-for-performance paradigm.

Using a representative sample of S&P 1500 firms, I find that half the CEOs have some form of severance agreement in the year they take office. The analysis of the determinants suggests that uncertainty {{about the quality of the}} CEO and the stability of the firm drive which CEOs get a severance agreement.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis study {{examines}} {{the application of}} the flexicurity labour system in the Caribbean countries of Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The flexicurity system has its origins in Denmark and combines elements of labour market flexibility with social security for workers. After outlining the elements of the system, the study provides an overview of the labour market in the Caribbean and compares the performance of Denmark with the three Caribbean countries. The comparison shows that there is a much lower level of flexibility and security in the three Caribbean states than in Denmark. The degree of labour market flexibility is examined in the Caribbean context and the discussion indicates that some limited degree of flexibility exist especially work time and functional flexibility. Some {{attempts have been made to}} introduce financial flexibility. Some small measure of social protection exists for displaced workers in the form of <b>severance</b> and redundancy <b>pay.</b> Only Barbados has an unemployment scheme which cover workers for up to six months of unemployment. Jamaica is planning to introduce an unemployment assistance scheme. In general, the social protection schemes for workers are weak in the region. In the area of active labour market policies, training programs have been the main area of activity with some provision of employment services for those looking for jobs. All the countries have targeted young persons since these face the bulk of the unemployment in the region. Social dialogue has been developing in the countries with Barbados being at the forefront of this arrangement at the national level. Jamaica has adopted a sectoral approach. While that flexicurity system has some attractive features its full implementation is limited in the Caribbean since the institutional framework has not been fully developed to sustain the implementation of the system and the costs of the system can be a burden to national governments. It is however possible those elements of the system can be applied to the Caribbean countries (and have been applied). Labour market reform in the region can however take elements of the system into consideration...|$|R

After fifteen days and two rounds of the playoffs, the referees union, the National Association of Basketball Referees, was recognized as a bargaining agent for officials and playoff salaries increased from $150 a game to $750, $850, and $950 for the final three rounds of the playoffs.

25|$|Fascists {{claimed that}} this {{system would be}} egalitarian and {{traditional}} at the same time. The economic policy of corporatism quickly faltered: the left-wing elements of the Fascist manifesto were opposed by industrialists and landowners who supported the party because it pledged to defend Italy from socialism. As a result, corporatist policy became dominated by the industries. Initially, economic legislation mostly favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes by allowing privatization, liberalization of rent laws, tax cuts and administrative reform. However, economic policy changed drastically following the Matteotti Crisis where Mussolini began pushing for a totalitarian state. In 1926, the Syndical laws (also known as the Rocco laws) were passed, organizing the economy into 12 separate employer and employee unions. The unions were largely state-controlled and were mainly used to suppress opposition and reward political loyalty. While the Fascist unions could not protect workers from all economic consequences, they {{were responsible for the}} handling of social security benefits, claims for <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> and could sometimes negotiate contracts that benefited workers.|$|E
