25|$|The {{production}} of the television programmes was decentralised, with three Base Production Centres located at Delhi, Cuttack and Hyderabad, and an ISRO studio located in Mumbai. Each of the centres had a production studio, three IVC tape recorders, two 16mm. projectors, a <b>slide</b> <b>Projector</b> in Telecine and audio equipment like tape desks and turntables. Each centre also had 2–3 full-fledged synchronised sound camera units, an editing table (Delhi had two) and a film processing plant. There was also a sound dubbing studio equipped with a pilot tone recording plant and an audio mixing console.|$|E
25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the <b>slide</b> <b>projector</b> or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E
25|$|In Bristol in 1968, {{progress}} was also being made, mainly {{for use in}} live music. Peter Wynne Wilson refers {{to the use of}} 1kW profiles, with slides onto which gobos were printed, inserted from a reel just like on a <b>slide</b> <b>projector.</b> The fixtures also had an iris, a multiple coloured gel wheel. These lights were also fitted with mirrors and made for an impressive light show for a Pink Floyd Gig in London. Another fixture known as the 'Cycklops' was also used for music in the USA, although it was limited in terms of capabilities. With only pan, tilt, and color functions, and at 1.2meters long and weighing in at 97kilograms including the ballast, they were heavy and cumbersome. These units were designed more for replacing the ever unreliable local spotlight operators.|$|E
50|$|Pentacon also {{produced}} <b>slide</b> <b>projectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Parallel to {{the camera}} {{manufacturing}} began the development and construction of film <b>slide</b> <b>projectors.</b> In 1955, under the Carl Braun Camera-Werk Nürnberg label, the company introduced {{one of the first}} semi-automatic <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> with a tray magazine to the consumer market named Paximat. [...] Other innovations included wired or wireless remote control, automatic focus, brighter halogen lamps, and variable brightness control. Since 1955, about 4 million <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> have been built and sold in 120 countries around the world under the names Paximat or Novamat.|$|R
5000|$|A {{diaporama}} is {{a photographic}} slideshow, sometimes with accompanying audio, ranging from using {{only one or}} two <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> to a multi-image slideshow using a wide screen and several <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> connected to a central controlling device changing the slides, turning lamps on and off etc.|$|R
500|$|Lesser states, [...] "This {{became the}} first time in television's 25-year history that child-watching was {{systematically}} applied over a sustained period to the design of a televised series for children". [...] Lesser describes the new methods researcher Edward Palmer created to study the effects Sesame Street had on its young viewers; for example, the [...] "distractor", in which a <b>slide</b> <b>projector</b> was placed next to a television set and adjusted to change slides every eight seconds. [...] The researchers recorded when children in their study moved their attention away from the television to the projector, and the data collected were analyzed. [...] Segments were removed based upon the information gathered. [...] "This was {{the first time in}} television's history that the children themselves would be listened to with care as a television series for them was designed and broadcast", Lesser states.|$|E
500|$|A third unit, {{headed by}} Derek Meddings and his {{assistant}} Mike Trim, handled special effects and miniatures and was tasked with creating all the permanent sets and models to be used from the pilot episode, such as the Cloudbase interiors and scaled-down Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles. A design innovation for this series meant that the noses of the miniature vehicles would [...] "dip" [...] when stopped, to imitate the sudden application of brakes and deceleration on a real-life vehicle. The miniature of the Cloudbase exterior, which ran to sixfeet (1.8m) in length, proved to be too heavy to be held up with strings and was instead supported by a metal pole. To transfer the Mysteron rings from script to screen, the production team acted {{on the advice of}} producer Reg Hill, who suggested that a transparency be made that could be panned across the puppet sets using a <b>slide</b> <b>projector.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for the The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "It {{is rather}} {{difficult to understand}} by what magic the two signatures are made {{to appear in the}} court room without human agency. They come and go in anything but legal fashion. Evidently their appearance is to be taken symbolically - not realistically." [...] The final part of the review is difficult to infer because the film is lost, but the synopsis states that a stereopticon was used. A stereopticon, {{not to be confused with}} a stereoscope, is a type of <b>slide</b> <b>projector</b> that projects an image. According to the synopsis, the production employs one, or possibly two, stereopticon's to display the two different signatures to compare and reveal the forgery. The reviewer seems to state that the appearance as unnatural, perhaps referencing a dissolve effect. The ability to project with a dissolve was a known ability of more advanced stereopticons. According to another reviewer the film included shots of Long Island Sound.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{the company began}} {{manufacturing}} <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> (for conventional 2x2-inch slides), viewers for conventional slides and scenic slide sets. By 1961, <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> had become Sawyers' second-most-profitable product. A new model introduced in 1963 {{was known as the}} Sawyer's Rotomatic and used upright circular trays, called Rototrays, to hold the slides (100 per tray).|$|R
5000|$|... 35 mm <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> direct {{descendants}} of the larger-format magic lantern, first came into widespread use during the 1950s {{as a form of}} occasional home entertainment; family members and friends would gather to view slide shows, which typically consisted of slides snapped during vacations and at family events. <b>Slide</b> <b>projectors</b> were also widely used in educational and other institutional settings.|$|R
50|$|The first large-format <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> {{were built}} {{in the middle of the}} 20th century as {{background}} projectors for theaters and opera houses. The artists Professor Schneider-Siemmsen, Professor Svoboda and Herbert von Karajan used the large format <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> as stage projectors in their artwork. In good cooperation with the technician Ing. Ludwig Pani, they realized the first large format projections as an integrated part of their artwork.|$|R
500|$|The show {{features}} classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, {{in combination}} with atypical elements. Much of the series {{is devoted to the}} science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode [...] "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a <b>slide</b> <b>projector</b> to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled zeppelin. Campbell told Starlog magazine, [...] "It's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West." [...] The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; {{it is one of the}} few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though [...] "technology-out-of-time" [...] frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.|$|E
2500|$|Color {{photography}} may form {{images as}} positive transparencies, {{which can be}} used in a <b>slide</b> <b>projector,</b> or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995–2005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive [...] "look".|$|E
2500|$|A {{dominant}} feature of most planetaria {{is the large}} dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars, planets and other celestial objects {{can be made to}} appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens'. [...] The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies, for example precision-engineered 'star balls' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology, <b>slide</b> <b>projector,</b> video and fulldome projector systems, and lasers. Whatever technologies are used, the objective is normally to link them together to provide an accurate relative motion of the sky. Typical systems can be set to display the sky at any point in time, past or present, and often to show the night sky as it would appear from any point of latitude on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Sawyer's, Inc. was an American {{manufacturer}} and retailer of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> scenic <b>slides,</b> View-Master reels and viewers, postcards, and related products, based in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 1914 as a photo-finishing company, Sawyer's began producing and selling View-Masters in 1939, and that soon became its primary product. It later diversified into other photographic products, mostly related to film transparencies, and established manufacturing plants in Europe, Japan and India. By the early 1960s, Sawyer's was the nation's second-largest manufacturer of <b>slide</b> <b>projectors,</b> and by 1965 <b>slide</b> <b>projectors</b> had surpassed View-Master reels and equipment {{as a percentage}} of the company's annual sales. In 1951, the company moved from Portland proper to the unincorporated Progress area in Portland's southwestern suburbs. In 1966, Sawyer's was acquired by New York-based General Aniline & Film (GAF), and its product lines and facilities were taken over by GAF. It was a subsidiary company of GAF until 1968, when it became simply a division of that company, renamed the GAF Consumer Photo Division.

2500|$|Robert {{read the}} works of 17th-century scholar Athanasius Kircher and was {{particularly}} interested in the magic lantern, an early form of <b>slide</b> <b>projector.</b> [...] He created his own version of the device with several improvements, adding adjustable lenses and a moveable carriage system that would allow the operator to change the size of the projected image. [...] He also made it possible to project several different images at once using more than one painted glass slider. [...] The resultant display had a very ghostly effect especially when in a smoky atmosphere. [...] Through this the operator had the ability to manipulate images projected from an unseen location. [...] In 1799, after further refining the system, he received a patent for his [...] "magic lantern on wheels", naming it the Fantoscope.|$|E
2500|$|Sales totaled $8.6million in 1961 and $9.1million in 1962. [...] New {{products}} {{introduced in}} 1962 included a dictation machine.
