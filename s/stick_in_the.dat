5|$|Tanev {{played a}} major role in the 2016 IIHF World Championships team which {{captured}} gold against Finland. He was praised for his composure and defensive play by Team Canada head coach Bill Peters, and was named the best player of the game in Canada's 7-1 victory over Hungary. In the tournament semifinal versus the United States, Tanev robbed a scoring chance from the Americans late in the third period, which would have resulted in the tying goal. After accidentally breaking his <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American zone, he raced back to the Canadian end, intercepting a pass and blocking a shot without the use of his stick.|$|E
5|$|The three {{episodes of}} Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons make up one side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{most of the}} game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. Keen can move left and right and can jump; after finding a pogo <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first episode, he can also bounce continuously and jump higher than he can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The second episode introduces moving platforms as well as switches that extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Once entered, {{the only way to}} exit a level is to reach the end, and the player cannot save and return to the middle of a level. In between levels, Keen travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by moving Keen to the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following specific procedures.|$|E

25|$|A {{lubricant}} is {{used when}} forging to reduce friction and wear. It {{is also used}} as a thermal barrier to restrict heat transfer from the workpiece to the die.

25|$|Some {{cars from}} the 1920s to early 1960s used {{retractable}} semaphores called trafficators rather than flashing lights. They were commonly mounted high {{up behind the}} front doors and swung out horizontally. However, they were fragile and could be easily broken off and also {{had a tendency to}} <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closed position. These can be fitted with flashing lights as an upgrade.|$|E
25|$|Maniaq (lit. «roasted thing») is roasted (barbecued) over an {{open fire}} fish. All parts of the fish except the guts are used. Over an open fire, a green branch or drift wood is used by {{inserting}} the <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the fish, then pushing the stick though the fish along the backbone until the stick emerges {{at the base of}} the tail. the stick is then propped up near the open fire to begin roasting. a modern alternative is to wrap the fish in foil and piece it in the camp fire.|$|E
25|$|In game three, Ben Lovejoy {{started off}} the scoring at 5:29 {{of the first}} period after his shot got {{deflected}} in off Sharks defenceman Roman Polak. The Sharks tied it up at 9:34 on Justin Braun's goal after receiving a pass from Joe Thornton. The Penguins got their second lead {{of the game in}} the second period with Ben Lovejoy's point shot being tipped in off forward Patric Hornqvist's <b>stick.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third period, Penguins forward Nick Bonino high-sticked Thornton (resulting in some blood being spilled) causing a four-minute power play for the Sharks. In the dying seconds of the power play, Joel Ward fired a slap shot that got past Matt Murray. In overtime, Joonas Donskoi fired a shot that went high over Murray into the net for the game winner.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{versions}} of lacrosse used unusual <b>stick</b> designs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> St. Lawrence Valley a version was played <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> head took up {{two thirds of}} <b>the</b> <b>stick.</b> [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Southwestern United States a double-stick version was played with sticks {{about two and a}} half feet long.|$|R

25|$|He was {{a member}} of four Stanley Cup winning teams between 1905 and 1910 with the Montreal Wanderers of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) and later the National Hockey Association (NHA). He moved west, and {{switched}} from left wing to defence, in 1911 to join the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He spent the following decade playing with the New Westminster Royals, Portland Rosebuds and Victoria Aristocrats where he was named a PCHA first-team all-star eight times and played in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals with Portland. He later played minor professional hockey in California, Minnesota and Oregon before retiring at the age of 45. Johnson was known for using perhaps the longest <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game's history, giving him a 99-inch reach. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl {{lozenges}} (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation of}} fentanyl citrate on a <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a stick swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, {{and the rest is}} swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).|$|E

This, I gather, used to be a friendly affair until I turned up, and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for whom I was the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself." ...|$|E

[...] Stewart was known for his large grin when hitting opponents; teammate Ted Lindsay noted [...] "when he had that smile, it was time for the opposition to look out". [...] He led the league with 73 penalty minutes in 1945–46, and in the late 1940s, his rivalry with Milt Schmidt of the Boston Bruins was so intense that their physical interactions occasionally overshadowed the games themselves.|$|E

500|$|A {{company of}} {{men from the}} Territorial Force was already {{stationed}} at Rusambo, advised {{by a team of}} intelligence officers. [...] "Sticks" [...] of four men (three FN FAL riflemen and an MAG gunner) would be sent out into the bush from Rusambo for periods of up to two weeks, equipped with a radio to communicate with the base. Their task while in action was to seek out guerrillas by means of patrolling, ambushing and operating observation and listening posts. Once a group of insurgents was spotted, the stick leader would report their positions; Rusambo would then alert the Army and request a Fireforce. If Fireforce were available, it would arrive and engage the cadres; if not, the <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field would have to handle the situation itself.|$|E

500|$|The sea–mine {{called the}} 'submarine dragon–king' {{is made of}} wrought iron, and carried on a (submerged) wooden board, [...] The (mine) is {{enclosed}} in an ox-bladder. Its subtlety {{lies in the fact}} that a thin incense(–stick) is arranged (to float) above the mine in a container. The (burning) of this joss stick determines the time at which the fuse is ignited, but without air its glowing would of course go out, so the container is connected with the mine by a (long) piece of goat's intestine (through which passes the fuse). At the upper end the (joss <b>stick</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> container) is kept floating by (an arrangement of) goose and wild–duck feathers, so that it moves up and down with the ripples of the water.

500|$|McCay was {{evacuated}} {{to hospital}} in Alexandria. He rejoined his brigade at Anzac on 8 June but the wound had not fully healed {{and he was}} lame, walking {{with the aid of}} a <b>stick.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, General Bridges had been mortally wounded on 18 May and the Australian government sent the Chief of the General Staff, Major General James Gordon Legge, to replace him as commander of the 1st Division. [...] McCay, Monash and Colonel Harry Chauvel were all disappointed at being passed over for the command, and protested to Birdwood and the Australian government, but to no avail. However, Legge chose McCay to command the 2nd Division, then forming in Egypt. Unfortunately, on 11 July, the day before he was due to leave for Egypt, McCay's leg snapped where the bone had been broken at Krithia. He was evacuated again, this time to Malta, and then to the United Kingdom, where he was visited by Sir George Reid, now the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. McCay's wife Julia died while he was in hospital. Several weeks later his father died as well. McCay was therefore sent back to Australia on compassionate leave. He arrived back in Melbourne on RMS Malwa on 11 November 1915, accompanied by his two teenage daughters and his brother Hugh, who had joined the ship in Adelaide, to a hero's welcome. For his service at Gallipoli, McCay was mentioned in despatches for his [...] "great promptitude in supporting the threatened flank of the covering force" [...] during the landing and his [...] "conspicuous gallantry" [...] at Krithia. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and bestowed the Croix de Commander de la Légion d'honneur by the President of France.|$|E
