40|$|Â© 2016 Elsevier B. V. Objective: This study aims {{to explore}} the {{association}} between using smartphone dating applications (apps) and having unprotected sex with a casual <b>sex</b> <b>partner.</b> Study design: This is a cross-sectional study. Students were recruited from four university campuses in Hong Kong by convenience sampling. Main outcome measures: Subjects completed a structured questionnaire asking {{about the use of}} dating apps, sexual history and socio-demographic information. Multiple logistic regressions were used {{to explore the}} association between using dating apps and having unprotected sex with a casual <b>sex</b> <b>partner.</b> Results: Six hundred and sixty-six subjects were included in the analysis. Users of dating apps {{were more likely to have}} had unprotected sex with a casual <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> the last time they engaged in sexual intercourse (aOR: 10. 06). Using dating apps for more than 12 months was associated with having a casual <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> in the last sexual intercourse (aOR: 3. 21), as well as having unprotected sex with that casual partner (aOR: 13. 56). Conclusion: We found a robust association between using dating apps and having unprotected sex with a casual <b>sex</b> <b>partner,</b> implying that using dating apps is an emerging sexual risk factor. We recommend that interventions promoting the safe use of dating apps should be implemented. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The study concludes that people who had one to five oral <b>sex</b> <b>partners</b> in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral <b>sex</b> <b>partners</b> had a 250 percent increased risk.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{systematic}} review (analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide) found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as {{number of sexual}} partners, and sexual-health status.

25|$|After {{obtaining a}} sexual history, a {{healthcare}} provider should encourage risk reduction by providing prevention counseling. Prevention counseling {{is most effective}} if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the person's culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs should be offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received a diagnosis, have had an STI in the past year, or have multiple <b>sex</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E
25|$|BV {{is caused}} by an {{imbalance}} of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There {{is a change in}} {{the most common type of}} bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than Lactobacilli become more common. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple <b>sex</b> <b>partners,</b> antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device, among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a vaginal yeast infection or infection with Trichomonas.|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted to investigate multiple levels of HIV risk-individual risk factors, <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> characteristics, and socioeconomic factors-among African American women, who, in 2010, comprised 64 % of the estimated 9, 500 new infections in women. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit and interview women in 20 cities with high AIDS prevalence in the United States through the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System. We assessed individual risk factors, <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> characteristics, and socioeconomic characteristics associated with being HIV-positive but unaware of the infection among African American women. Among 3, 868 women with no previous diagnosis of HIV, 68 % had high school education or more and 84 % lived at or below the poverty line. In multivariable analysis, women who were 35 years or older, homeless, received Medicaid, whose last <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> ever used crack cocaine or was an exchange <b>sex</b> <b>partner</b> {{were more likely to be}} HIV-positive-unaware. Developing and implementing strategies that address socioeconomic factors, such as homelessness and living in poverty, as well as individual risk factors, can help to maximize the effectiveness of the public health response to the HIV epidemic.

25|$|Sex is a {{basic form}} of {{communication}} in bonobos’ life. It seems to infuse everything from simple expressions of affection {{to the establishment of}} dominance. Female bonobos have been observed to engage in sexual activities to create bonds with dominant bonobos. Having created this bond with the male, they will share food with each other and not compete with each other. All members of the group are potential <b>sex</b> <b>partners,</b> males participate in sexual activity with other males, as do females with other females. These bonds made between females are for protection against male bonobos. If a male bonobo attempts to harass a female bonobo, the other females will help the female defend herself because of the strong bonds they have with each other.|$|E
25|$|About {{one third}} of the women {{experienced}} sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their <b>sex</b> <b>partners.</b> The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. Inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{can be classified}} into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, {{as well as by}} the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, casual <b>sex</b> <b>partners</b> or anonymous. Sexual {{activity can}} be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, paraphilia, or BDSM activities. Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.|$|E
