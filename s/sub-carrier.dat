25|$|OFDM {{is used in}} ADSL {{connections}} that follow the ANSI T1.413 and G.dmt (ITU G.992.1) standards, where it is called discrete multitone modulation (DMT). DSL achieves high-speed data connections on existing copper wires. OFDM is also used in the successor standards ADSL2, ADSL2+, VDSL, VDSL2, and G.fast. ADSL2 uses variable <b>sub-carrier</b> modulation, ranging from BPSK to 32768QAM (in ADSL terminology this {{is referred to as}} bit-loading, or bit per tone, 1 to 15 bits per <b>sub-carrier).</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{differential}} modulation such as DPSK or DQPSK {{is applied to}} each <b>sub-carrier,</b> equalization can be completely omitted, since these non-coherent schemes are insensitive to slowly changing amplitude and phase distortion.|$|E
25|$|The term {{discrete}} multitone modulation (DMT) denotes OFDM based {{communication systems}} that adapt the transmission to the channel conditions individually for each <b>sub-carrier,</b> {{by means of}} so-called bit-loading. Examples are ADSL and VDSL.|$|E

30|$|The {{considered}} WiFi chipset {{reports the}} CSI for {{a subset of}} the OFDM <b>sub-carriers,</b> as defined by the grouping option Ng in the IEEE 802.11 n standard [35]. Focusing on the 20 -MHz bandwidth mode, with 64 available <b>sub-carriers,</b> that include data, pilot, and null <b>sub-carriers,</b> the IWL 5300 board reports CSI data for m= 30 <b>sub-carriers,</b> with grouping number Ng= 2. According to the MIMO-OFDM baseband model depicted in Fig.  4 d, the effective bandwidth considered for monitoring of channel frequency selectivity is equal to 18.75 MHz.|$|R
25|$|An OFDM {{carrier signal}} {{is the sum}} of a number of {{orthogonal}} sub-carriers, with baseband data on each <b>sub-carrier</b> being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK). This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.|$|E
25|$|In OFDM, the <b>sub-carrier</b> {{frequencies}} {{are chosen}} {{so that the}} sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that cross-talk between the sub-channels is eliminated and inter-carrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver; unlike conventional FDM, a separate filter for each sub-channel is not required.|$|E
25|$|Some of the sub-carriers {{in some of}} the OFDM symbols {{may carry}} pilot signals for {{measurement}} of the channel conditions (i.e., the equalizer gain and phase shift for each <b>sub-carrier).</b> Pilot signals and training symbols (preambles) may also be used for time synchronization (to avoid intersymbol interference, ISI) and frequency synchronization (to avoid inter-carrier interference, ICI, caused by Doppler shift).|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{frequency}} synchronization in OFDM-based communications systems in the context of frequency-selective fading channels. Frequency offsets are estimated by inserting null <b>sub-carriers</b> into a single OFDM block. The paper clarifies issues related to acquisition range and identifiability of carrier frequency offset (CFO), and performance of estimators. A deterministic maximum likelihood estimation approach is adopted. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of null-subcarriers and their placement in order to ensure identifiability. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the CFO is derived; for a given number of null <b>sub-carriers,</b> the optimal placement which minimizes the CRB is derived. We show that if the number of null <b>sub-carriers</b> is less than half the total number of <b>sub-carriers,</b> performance is optimal when the null <b>sub-carriers</b> are equispaced...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} the leakage that the FD <b>sub-carriers</b> {{generate}} into the HD ones is modeled as an EVM noise with average power proportional to the residual self-interference generated by the FD <b>sub-carriers</b> PDP·PT/SIC, as PDP·(PT/SIC)/γE.|$|R
25|$|MIMO signal testing focuses {{first on}} the transmitter/receiver system. The random phases of the <b>sub-carrier</b> signals can produce {{instantaneous}} power levels that cause the amplifier to compress, momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors. Signals with a high PAR (peak-to-average ratio) can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission. OFDM signals are very dynamic and compression problems {{can be hard to}} detect because of their noise-like nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{resilience}} {{to severe}} channel conditions {{can be further}} enhanced if information about the channel is sent over a return-channel. Based on this feedback information, adaptive modulation, channel coding and power allocation may be applied across all sub-carriers, or individually to each <b>sub-carrier.</b> In the latter case, if a particular range of frequencies suffers from interference or attenuation, the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run slower by applying more robust modulation or error coding to those sub-carriers.|$|E

30|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{spectrum sensing}} over multiple <b>sub-carriers</b> is performed {{by using a}} set of multi-band joint detectors, as proposed in [21]. At each SU, N signal samples corresponding to N <b>sub-carriers</b> are obtained using N independent energy detectors.|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected <b>sub-carrier</b> (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E
2500|$|OFDM is a {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (FDM) scheme {{used as a}} digital multi-carrier modulation method. [...] A large number of closely spaced orthogonal <b>sub-carrier</b> signals are used to carry data [...] on several parallel data streams or channels.

2500|$|The {{orthogonality}} {{requires that}} the <b>sub-carrier</b> spacing is [...] Hertz, where TU seconds is the useful symbol duration (the receiver-side window size), and k is a positive integer, typically equal to 1. [...] Therefore, with N sub-carriers, the total passband bandwidth will be B ≈ N·Δf (Hz).|$|E
2500|$|OFDM {{requires}} {{very accurate}} frequency synchronization between {{the receiver and}} the transmitter; with frequency deviation the sub-carriers {{will no longer be}} orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the sub-carriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each <b>sub-carrier</b> in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (...) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per subcarrier equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{noise power}} and {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) estimations for OFDM based wireless communication sys-tems are studied. Noise power estimation, which {{takes into account}} the color and variation of noise statistics over OFDM <b>sub-carriers</b> into account, is considered. Instead of averaging the instantaneous noise samples estimates over all of the OFDM <b>sub-carriers,</b> dividing the total number of <b>sub-carriers</b> into several sub-groups and averaging the <b>sub-carriers</b> separately within each sub-group is proposed. Also, these averaged estimates over each sub-group are fur-ther averaged across several OFDM symbols in time to en-hance the performance of the noise power estimates. The proposed solution provides many local estimates, allow-ing tracking of the variation of the noise statistics across OFDM <b>sub-carriers,</b> which is particularly of use in sub-band adaptive modulation OFDM systems. The perfor-mance of the proposed method is evaluated via computer simulations. It is observed that the proposed solution can estimate local statistics of the noise power when the noise is colored. When the noise is white, the proposed algorithm works as good as the conventional noise power estimation schemes, showing the robustness of the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|We conduct {{experiments}} {{to quantify the}} level of channel orthogonality in indoor environments. We use one WARP board as the AP and two other WARP boards as users. The AP is equipped with 4 antennas, while each user has only 1 antenna. We set the number of <b>sub-carriers</b> to 256. We show the measured channel orthogonality between the two users on different <b>sub-carriers</b> in Figs.  2 d and 3 d. We can see that, due to frequency-selective fading, the channel orthogonality of the users fluctuate significantly across different <b>sub-carriers</b> for both frequency bands, {{with a standard deviation}} ranging from around 0.10 to 0.3. Also, 2.4 GHz has presented a relatively larger variance in channel orthogonality than 5.2 GHz, with the maximum standard deviation approaching 0.34. For the <b>sub-carriers</b> that possess less orthogonality, spatial efficiency degrades significantly.|$|R

Therefore, for the real time localization, we only use the 12 <b>sub-carriers</b> selected at calibration phase to estimate the target position.|$|R
2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a <b>sub-carrier</b> spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E

This changes the spacing of each <b>sub-carrier</b> {{a little bit}} more each <b>sub-carrier</b> further to the left. About 105 Hz apart on the right, to about 109 Hz apart on the left. This design, along with spectrum clipping, improves the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The measured Crest factor is about 8.3 dB with clipping, and about 10.3 dB without clipping.|$|E
5000|$|Binary Offset Carrier {{modulation}} (BOC modulation) {{was developed}} by John Betz, PhD, {{in order to allow}} interoperability of satellite navigation systems.

Following this <b>sub-carrier</b> multiplication, the spectrum of the signal is divided into two parts, therefore BOC modulation is also known as a split-spectrum modulation.|$|E
