40|$|The {{effects of}} grain size and {{geometric}} <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> processing were investigated for several processing techniques. The motivation for conducting {{this research was}} to improve {{our understanding of the}} microstructural evolution and thermo-mechanical behavior of UFG copper as a ‘model material’ used in micro-forming processes. Coarse grained (CG) copper was also investigated for comparison. The starting UFG material was obtained by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). Micro deep-drawing and micro-extrusion were the two micro-forming processes investigated; geometry, crystallographic orientation effects and thermal stability were all examined. Crystallographic orientation was determined using electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction; grain size was determined by EBSD; and thermal stability was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and nano-indentation. Geometry effects were inferred from mechanical tests coupled with material characterization data. These experiments were supported by application of a grain fragmentation model coupled to a visco-plastic self consistent (VPSC) simulation in ECAP and micro-extrusion, and a VPSC simulation in micro-deep drawing. In order to characterize the starting material a comparative study was conducted for different strain paths: ECAP and cold rolling. The refined grain size was significantly smaller in ECAP than in rolling. Grain fragmentation modeling demonstrated that these differences are attributable to the different lattice rotation rate in ECAP and cold rolling, and this provides important insight into the grain refinement process to obtain UFG structures. EBSD measurements of ECAP-ed copper demonstrate that the misorientation distribution depends on the measurement plane. A new procedure is used which separates the misorientation distributions into two parts: a distribution that describes misorientations between subgrains within the original parent grain interior and a distribution that is measured across the original parent grain boundaries. The procedure permits us to track microstructure as it evolves from the original so-called ‘parent grains’. It is based on measurements on two planes of misorientation, grain shape evolution; and subgrain size variations. The results obtained showed large misorientations in the boundary regions of the parent grains and mostly low misorientations for the new grains emerging in the interior of the parent grain. In order to examine the effect of texture evolution on material behavior, micro deep drawing of ECAP-ed copper was investigated. Two blank thicknesses were investigated, and it was found experimentally that when the grain size was about one tenth of the thickness, the CG copper was less drawable. Through-thickness variations in the texture of the UFG copper were found by experiment and this was explained by simulations. It was shown that rigid body rotation during the drawing process {{play an important role in}} the evolution of the texture. Such variation is important in cup-forming if the grain size is very small. Thermal stability during further processing is one of the main concerns in the application of UFG materials for micro-forming. Micro-extruded copper with a range of grain sizes, spanning from CG to UFG copper, have been studied at different extrusion speeds. It was clear that the grain size after micro-extrusion depends on the processing speed and was always larger than the grain size expected from purely geometrical considerations of the process. Differential scanning calorimetry, dislocation density measurements and hardness all support the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) of the UFG copper – but importantly not the CG copper – during micro-extrusion at the highest extrusion speed of 25 mm/min. The effect of recovery was incorporated in the grain refinement model by changing the curvature induced dislocation density represented by an adjustable parameter in model for CG copper at the extrusion speed of 1 mm/min. Good agreement with the experimental observation was obtained. Importantly, although the CG copper was micro-extrudable, the thermal stability of UFG copper was superior after high speed micro-extrusion because of the dynamic recrystallization and this justifies the use of UFG copper in this case...|$|E

40|$|When the {{shear stress}} on a {{compliant}} surface exceeds the yield {{strength of the}} material, a periodic wrinkle pattern is often observed. This phenomenon has been also recognized at the nanometer <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> polymers, <b>metals,</b> ionic crystals and semiconductors. In those cases, the mechanical stress can be efficiently provided by a sharp indenter elastically driven at constant velocity along the surface. Here we suggest that the formation of such surface ripples {{can be explained by}} the competition between the driving spring force and the plastic response of the substrate. In particular, we show how the ripples are expected to disappear when the indentation rate is below a critical value or, alternatively, when the sliding velocity or the lateral stiffness of the contact are too high. The model results are compared to atomic force microscopy experiments on a solvent-enriched polystyrene surface, where the rippling formation is enhanced at room temperature, compared to bulk melts. A similar approach could be employed to describe rippling phenomena <b>on</b> larger <b>scales.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of radioactive contaminants into corrosion product <b>scales</b> <b>on</b> <b>metals</b> {{is being investigated}} using in-situ spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. To facilitate the study, stable isotopes are used initially, while the corrosion films are simulated by electrodeposition of the appropriate oxide (hydroxide) onto a graphite substrate. Synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is {{used to determine the}} structure and composition of the host oxide film, as well as the local structure of the impurity ion. Results on the {{incorporation of}} Sr and Ce into surface films of Ni(OH) {sub 2 } and NiOOH are reported. Cathodically deposited Ni(OH) {sub 2 } was found to be mainly in the {alpha} form while anodically prepared NiOOH consists of Ni{sup + 2 } and Ni{sup + 4 } phases. Sr in the films consists mainly of Sr{sup 2 +} which appears to be coordinated to oxygen atoms and is likely to exist as small domains of co-precipitated material. Ce in Ni(OH) {sub 2 } exists mainly as Ce{sup + 3 } and as a Ce{sup + 4 } species when co-deposited with NiOOH. The structure of the Ce{sup + 4 } phase appears similar to a Ce(OH) {sub 4 } standard. However, x-ray diffraction and laser Raman measurements indicate that the latter chemical formulation is probably incorrect and that the material {{is more likely to be}} a disordered hydrous cerium oxide. Ce chemisorbed on Ni(OH) {sub 2 } and NiOOH films is predominantly in the + 3 valency state. Iron oxide films prepared by anodic deposition from borate buffer solution containing Fe{sup + 2 }, has been found by XAS to consist mainly of {alpha} FeOOH. The latter has been found by others to be the constituent of the corrosion film on iron; this lends credence to the present simulation approach. Future work will involve studies on the incorporation of radioactive Sr, Ce, and Cs, as well as U, into nickel and iron oxide films. Investigations on the structure and composition of chromium oxide films, the effect of temperature on the energetics and mechanism of incorporation of heavy metal ions, as well as the subsequent dissolution of the films by electroreduction and anodic oxidation, will be undertaken. ...|$|R
40|$|Machining is an {{important}} excess-metal removal process in manufacturing. In spite of the considerable effort <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> cutting research, the mechanics of this process at a nano scale are not fully understood. Hence metal cutting research is a challenging field and is currently attracting the attention of workers {{in the field of}} plasticity of metals as well as those concerned with the more immediate problems in practice. Nano scale grooves such as nano channels and nano slots have many applications in semiconductor and biomedical industries, which are growing to meet the increasing demands of nano technology. Whenever nanomachining is performed to produce a nano <b>scale</b> groove <b>on</b> a <b>metal</b> surface, abrasive wear occurs. The ultimate aim of the analysis of the mechanics of metal machining at a nano scale is to understand the basic phenomena, to predict how the materials deforms, which mechanism is dominant and what machining parameters (depth of cut, machining velocity) are required for a given material and for a given machining condition to produce a nano scale groove. In this research, nanomachining was utilized to investigate the abrasive wear mechanism that produces a nano <b>scale</b> groove <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces. Two different tools (Berkovich and Conical) with the same tip radius of 100 nm but of different edge geometries were used to machine both polycrystalline materials and single crystal materials with a nano indenter equipped with a nano scratching attachment. During the machining operations, the generated normal and cutting forces were measured as a function of nano scale machining parameters. It was found that the generated forces (normal and cutting) increased with an increase in depth of cut; however, there was no significant effect on the generated forces due to the variation in machining velocities. In nano scale machining, the percentage of elastic recovery revealed that the deformation mechanisms were identified as elastoplastic in nature as opposed to the well-established completely plastic mode of traditional machining operations. The pile up volume due to elastoplastic deformation was utilized to distinguish between the ploughing and the cutting modes of abrasive wear mechanism. The percentage values of these two mechanisms were determined and utilized to obtain the dominant mode of an abrasive wear mechanism for producing a nano scale groove and to correlate this abrasive wear mechanism with the co-efficient of friction (µ) in different machining conditions. As a result of machining operations, the machined surface retains residual stress and strain. The type of residual stress, whether tensile or compressive, depends on the used machining parameters. It is however difficult to measure residual stress and strain at a nano scale machining level. Therefore, to understand the material deformation behaviour and their effect on the machined surface, numerical modelling of nano scale machining process was developed by using a novel mesh free modelling tool of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) ...|$|R

In order to overcome these problems, we combined the nanoindentation technique with a three-dimensional indent visualization technique in this study. Nanoindentation tests were performed for Au and TiN thin films and their corresponding indents were scanned by using an atomic force microscope. From the three-dimensional pile-up morphology, a circular pile-up boundary was measured and input into the yield strength formulation as an effective yielded zone radius.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} erosion and corrosion {{can lead to}} a number of material wastage scenarios in industrial environments. In some cases, for example at high temperatures in fluidized bed environments, the wear may be corrosion dominated where chipping of an oxide scale is the predominant process, while in more aggressive environments such as gas turbine conditions, formation of a protective scale may never occur. Thus, pre-oxidation to form a protective scale or coating of a substrate may be effective in reducing material loss in corrosion-dominated environments since particle energies may be low enough to prevent significant deformation of the underlying surfaces. A computer model has been developed to simulate the erosion of a preformed scale or a coating <b>on</b> a <b>metal</b> substrate. This model uses computer graphics to demonstrate the sequential stages of erosion-corrosion. By incorporating established erosion and corrosion algorithms to calculate the wastage rate, the surface topography and extent of wear can be shown after exposure to erosion-corrosion conditions of varying severity. Thus, one can extrapolate from this technique whether erosion of oxide or metal is likely to be dominant wastage mechanism. This model was developed to describe the erosion-corrosion of a preformed oxide <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> a <b>metal</b> and comparisons are made between the erosion results for pre-oxidized surfaces and the graphics after computer simulation of erosion-corrosion. However, since the factors which determine adhesion of a preformed scale may be similar in many respects to those of a coating, the model may equally describe the erosion-corrosion behaviour of a coated metal. Hence, the paper shows the stages of the model development and compares the experimental results with those of the model...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorous, {{being one}} of the {{fundamental}} building blocks of life, has been linked with the increase of cyanobacteria and algae growth. One of the main ways that phosphorous enters the marine ecosystem is through the form of runoff phosphates from fertilizers and industrial processes. In addition to disrupting the biology of ecosystems another drawback of excess of phosphates is the tendency for these chemical groups to form <b>scale</b> buildup <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> through the form of calcium phosphate. The goal of our project is to investigate a novel way of removing phosphate groups from wastewater {{with the use of the}} rare earth element cerium. Current methods that remove phosphates use iron and aluminum salts to react with the phosphate, creating crystalline complexes that can be filtered out as a precipitate. Our team hopes to evaluate a similar precipitation reaction with phosphate and cerium and evaluate the optimal parameter that promote the desired reaction. The main benefit of this reaction is that its crystals are exponentially smaller than the ones produced by the traditional phosphate removal processes (indicating that this novel method might be more efficient than the traditional methods). The main challenge of this project is to properly characterize the produced cerium phosphate crystals and design an industry-scale filtration process that would remove these crystals effectively. This analysis will be completed with the use of analytical chemistry techniques, nano-characterization equipment and process engineering design work. The filtration system design process will focus on optimizing produced crystalline complexes and then collecting and removing them effectively for large quantities of water. This project is being conducted with the support of ChemTreat, and with this partnership we hope to compare this new cerium based phosphate removal method with the current ferric-aluminum based methods. The results of this comparison could lead to the development of an entirely new and more effective method of removing phosphate from wastewater. [URL]...|$|R

The additional option of programmable tailoring of laser pulse intensity envelopes offers the possibility to regulate in a synergetic manner the energy delivery and creates the premises to upgrade the degree of process control. This presentation will focus on several potential implementation of pulse tailoring methods in the temporal domain in material processing for different classes of materials. It will be shown that, for example, suitably tailored pulses <b>on</b> picosecond <b>scales,</b> incident <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> targets, are able to design the subsequent thermodynamic path. The modified hydrodynamics has consequences on regulating the life-time of the post-irradiation liquid and on the generation of nanoparticles from the liquid phase. Applied on low band-gap material, temporally tailored pulses may drive the material in hottest states with minimal energetic expenses. The kinetics of the ejected material (e. g. swift ions) is influenced by the pre-designed succession of phase transitions. Another potential implementation of ultrafast lasers lies in the possibility to design photonic functions by structuring materials of optical interest. The strong nonlinear localization of energy induces refractive index changes that are the building blocks of compact, integrated optical devices. Nevertheless, the result of the laser action depends essentially {{on the nature of the}} material and may result in specific electronic and structural changes associated with either increasing or decreasing the refractive index under light exposure. We will show that programmable spatio-temporal engineering of the laser pulse can assist in controlling the gradual development of a refractive index change in materials of optical interest. By exploiting thermal transients and thermo-mechanical consequences, one can design the balance of the laser-induced sequence of electronic and structural transformations under modulated excitation and define the end result of the laser action. Based on examples on fused silica (a-SiO 2) and borosilicate (BK 7) glasses we show that spatio-temporal pulse shaping has the potential to achieve a high degree of process control and to design the nature of the refractive index so that guiding structures can be induced in materials that does not allow it under normal excitation conditions...|$|R
