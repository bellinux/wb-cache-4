40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to decreasing communication overhead: <b>splintering.</b> In contrast to OS bypass, the principle of <b>splintering</b> isn’t that the operating system shouldn’t be used, but that it should be used effectively. In the case of communication offload, the goal is to minimize the overhead associated with invoking the OS while still enabling the OS to control communication. We describe our initial experimentation with <b>splintering</b> defragment of IP datagrams. We follow this by a description of the approach we will take in <b>splintering</b> processing for TCP packets. ...|$|R
