Few <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> (10, 17) of C 3 during pre monsoon are grouped under C 1 of post monsoon.

The area also lacks proper drainage system where effluents are directly discharged into local tributaries and enters Sirsa river. CA supported by PCA confirms that the surface water chemistry is strongly controlled by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Hence, a good relation between the two statistical techniques (PCA and CA) is elucidated from the analyzed datasets of water samples.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{chemical}} composition of wood {{depends on a}} number of different factors, such as wood species, anatomical parts of wood, geographic location, habitation, growth, climatic characteristics, and degree of fungal and insect attacks. Recent studies report that the content of certain wood chemical components differed significantly in dependence on different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations.</b> As an extension of the mentioned studies, this study was aimed at investigating the influence of <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> which differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors (soil type, altitude and phytocoenoses) on the {{chemical composition}} of a wood native lignin (NL) model by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Materials and Methods: The beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) sapwood NL samples from seven <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> were used that differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors. NL was isolated according to a modified Brauns method described in previous research, and the FT-IR transmission spectroscopic technique was used for its characterization. The content of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl units (S), as well as syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was estimated for different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations.</b> The observed FT-IR peaks were assigned and quantified as percentages of the peak spectral heights, and the differences between NL were discussed in terms of lignin composition. Results: The results of statistical analysis of the NL contents showed significant differences between some <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> regarding phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. The obtained FT-IR spectral results revealed that the observed NL composition differs in S/G ratios linked to different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations,</b> as evidenced by relative heights of FT-IR peaks at 1282 – 1283 cm- 1 (represent G units) and 1327 – 1331 cm- 1 (represent S units). The estimated relationship between the content of guaiacyl and syringyl units of the NL model structure was assigned from 63. 06 - 36. 94 % and 71. 62 – 28. 38 %. For different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> the S/G ratios were from 0. 40 – 0. 59. Conclusions: Statistical analysis and comparison between the results of NL content for all <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> showed significant differences between some <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> with regard to phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. Furthermore, the results of this study, such as the obtained FT-IR spectras of NL, different S/G ratios and the content of guaiacyl and siringyl units, showed the significant influence of <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> on the chemical composition of the wood native lignin model in terms of the content of the observed phenylpropane units...|$|R

Previous researches {{came to the conclusion}} that chemical composition varies between samples of the same wood species from different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> based on phytocoenological criteria (soil type and phytocoenoses). This has been confirmed by this paper. Compared to previous studies, the results obtained show the increase of accessory material and lignin content, decrease of wood polyoses content, while ash and cellulose content remain unchanged. It has been shown by comparison of each location with identical chemical components and their correlation that <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> differ between themselves significantly (in terms of statistics) in accessory material and cellulose content, while the difference in ash, cellulose and wood polyoses content is negligible. Likewise,based on phytocoenological criteria of each <b>sampling</b> <b>location,</b> research results only show statistically significant differences in the accessory material content...|$|R
40|$|Soil samples {{have been}} {{collected}} routinely from the environs of the Hanford Site and analyzed since 1971.

40|$|Sampling of {{physical}} fields with mobile sensor is an emerging area. In this context, this work introduces and addresses {{some aspects of}} a fundamental question: can a spatial field be estimated from samples taken at unknown <b>sampling</b> <b>locations?</b> In a field (signal) sampling setup, unknown <b>sampling</b> <b>locations,</b> <b>sample</b> quantization, unknown bandwidth of the field, and presence of measurement-noise present difficulties {{in the process of}} field estimation. In this work, except for quantization, the other three issues will be tackled together in a mobile-sampling framework. Spatially bandlimited fields are considered. It is assumed that measurement-noise affected field samples are collected on spatial locations obtained from an unknown renewal process. That is, the samples are obtained on locations obtained from a renewal process, but the <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> and the renewal process distribution are unknown. In this challenging unknown <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> setup, it is shown that the mean-squared error in field estimation decreases as O(1 /n) where n is the average number of samples collected by the mobile sensor. The average number of samples collected is determined by the inter-sample spacing distribution in the renewal process. An algorithm to ascertain spatial field's bandwidth is detailed, which works with high probability as the average number of samples n increases. This algorithm works in the same setup, i. e., in the presence of measurement-noise and unknown <b>sampling</b> <b>locations...</b>|$|R

(Edge detection can reduce this further by explicitly limiting the MSAA calculation to pixels whose samples involve multiple triangles, or triangles at multiple depths.) In the extreme case where each of the multi <b>sample</b> <b>locations</b> is covered by a different triangle, a different shading computation will be performed for each location and the results then combined to give the final pixel, and the result and computational expense are the same as in the equivalent supersampled image.|$|E

50|$|In {{systematic}} and grid sampling, samples are taken at regularly spaced intervals over space or time.

Examples Systematic Grid Sampling - Square Grid Systematic Grid Sampling - Triangular Grids of systematic grids include square, rectangular, triangular, or radial grids.Cressie, 1993. In random systematic sampling, an initial sampling location (or time) is chosen at random and the remaining sampling sites are specified {{so that they are}} located according to a regular pattern. Random systematic sampling is used to search for hot spots and to infer means, percentiles, or other parameters and is also useful for estimating spatial patterns or trends over time.

5000|$|The {{classical}} rasterization algorithm projects each polygon {{onto the}} image plane, and determines which sample points from a regularly spaced set lie inside the projected polygon. Since {{the locations of}} these samples (i.e. pixels) are implicit, this determination {{can be made by}} testing the edges against the implicit grid of sample points. If, however the locations of the sample points are irregularly spaced and cannot be computed from a formula, then this approach does not work. The irregular Z-buffer solves this problem by storing <b>sample</b> <b>locations</b> explicitly in a two-dimensional spatial data structure, and later querying this structure to determine which samples lie within a projected triangle. This latter step is referred to as [...] "irregular rasterization". [...] Although the particular data structure used may vary from implementation to implementation, the two studied approaches are the kd-tree, and a grid of linked lists. A balanced kd-tree implementation has the advantage that it guarantees O(log(N)) access. Its chief disadvantage is that parallel construction of the kd-tree may be difficult, and traversal requires expensive branch instructions. The grid of lists has the advantage that it can be implemented more effectively on GPU hardware, which is designed primarily for the classical Z-buffer.|$|E
