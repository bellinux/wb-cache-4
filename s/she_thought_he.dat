5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Audrina rejects {{an invitation}} to Frankie's birthday party when she realizes that Kristin will be in attendance. Lo and Stephanie are shocked that Justin tells Kristin that he and Audrina were not officially a couple, but decide against confronting Kristin. Audrina is saddened after hearing of Justin's comments, and is worried that he and Kristin are seeing each other. During a later date with Justin, Kristin confesses that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> still has feelings for Audrina, and understands that Audrina looks at her as a threat.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{did not have enough}} to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

5|$|Rohan begs Rahul to come home, but Rahul refuses. Pooja {{convince}}s Rohan {{to invite}} {{his parents to}} London; Rahul and Nandini are overjoyed to see one another, but Rahul still refuses {{to talk to his}} father. When Yash goes to a store, Anjali stumbles by and Rohan reveals that they have been living in London the whole time. Yash soon learns that his mother had died and that her last wish was for Yash, Rahul, and Rohan to light her funeral pyre together. Therefore, the entire family attends the funeral, and Nandini tells Yash that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was wrong for disowning Rahul. Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul to talk to Yash, who apologizes and allows Rahul and Anjali into the house. Rohan and Pooja are married, and the family hold a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

25|$|Mrs. Verloc's mother: Old and infirm, Mrs Verloc's mother {{leaves the}} {{household}} {{to live in}} an almshouse, believing that two disabled people (herself and Stevie) are too much for Mr Verloc's generosity. The widow of a publican, she spent most of her life working hard in her husband's pub and believed Mr Verloc to be a gentleman because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> resembled patrons of business houses (pubs with higher prices, consequently frequented by higher classes).|$|E
25|$|During {{the trial}} of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was guilty, but she got some facts wrong. For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed out {{that if he had}} done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet. It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E
25|$|Her novel, Spring Riot, was {{published}} in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would like it since her play was also about a child, but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited {{for a couple of}} months and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The reader who had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry.|$|E

25|$|Harris's site {{attracted}} few visitors, {{and caused}} no concern until March 1998. Klebold gave the web address to Brooks Brown, a former friend of Harris. Brown's mother had filed numerous complaints with the Jefferson County Sheriff's office concerning Harris, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was dangerous. The website contained numerous death threats directed against Brown: Klebold {{knew that if}} Brooks accessed the address, he would discover the content and inform his parents, and likely the authorities would be notified. After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. The investigator Michael Guerra was told about the website. When he accessed it, Guerra discovered numerous violent threats directed against the students and teachers of Columbine High School. Other material included blurbs that Harris had written about his general hatred of society, and his desire to kill those who annoyed him.|$|E
25|$|One of Enju's allies. He also {{drank the}} moon spring water. He dresses up as a girl. It was shown {{that when he}} was young, he had ugly scars from an {{accident}} and that his fellow villagers thought of him as repulsive. One girl, Mai, the most beautiful girl in the village, befriended him because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was pitiful. After Maimai became beautiful from the spring water, he murdered everyone from his village and killed Mai because he felt ugly in her presence. He is Princess Yuri's younger brother, and has the same soul symbol as she has. Soul Symbol: Beauty. Similarly to Maora from The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, his physical appearance is drastically different dressing as a girl: he has a girly round eye shape and a delicate feminine neck as opposed to his masculine appearance.|$|E
500|$|Linh Dan Pham as Jeanne. Pham {{said that}} Jeanne [...] "loves Nemo Nobody {{with a passion}} but he doesn't love her. Their meeting was a misunderstanding. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was honest and full of love for her. But {{as soon as they}} start a family she realizes that {{something}} is missing in their relationship, that he's never really there. It also shows that lives that seem perfect on paper might not be so perfect in reality." [...] Actress Audrey Giacomini portrays Jeanne at fifteen.|$|E

500|$|When Cryer {{was twelve}} years old, {{he decided that he}} wanted to become an actor. When his mother heard this, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> should have a backup plan, and joked: [...] "Plumbing is a pretty good career." [...] Cryer {{attended}} Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager, and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin. To his mother's [...] "great disappointment", Cryer skipped college and went to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Mark {{returned}} during [...] "Episode 6646", {{which focused}} on an eclipse. Kate was left questioning whether she had really seen him. Brewer said that her character would be torn when Mark returns, as she had moved on with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Mark's reappearance [...] "just throws it all out of whack". When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. But things are different now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{substance}} of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, {{in a letter}} to the playwright, wrote: [...] "I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation." [...] Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> worked [...] "immensely hard" [...] at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun—"the fun of a brilliant artist". After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: [...] "No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw." ...|$|E

500|$|Hannah Arendt, a {{political}} theorist who reported on Eichmann's trial for The New Yorker, described Eichmann {{in her book}} Eichmann in Jerusalem {{as the embodiment of}} the [...] "banality of evil", as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> appeared to have an ordinary personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred. Arendt also wrote that [...] "this case was built on what the Jews had suffered, not on what Eichmann had done." [...] In his 1988 book Justice, Not Vengeance, Wiesenthal said: [...] "The world now understands the concept of 'desk murderer'. We know that one doesn't need to be fanatical, sadistic, or mentally ill to murder millions; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do one's duty." [...] The term [...] "" [...] became a pejorative term for bureaucrats charged with indirectly and systematically harming others.|$|E
500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was joking, but did as he asked. [...] He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. [...] By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.|$|E
500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: [...] "Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might have sung".|$|E
