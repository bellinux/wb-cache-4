5|$|During {{the design}} phase, Matsuno was shown {{photographs}} from France, particularly <b>Saint-Émilion</b> {{in the region}} of Bordeaux. This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E
25|$|Zhao is a {{well-known}} wine lover and has a passion for winemaking. On 21 December 2011, French newspaper Sud-Ouest reported that Zhao had bought Château Monlot, a <b>Saint-Émilion</b> Grand Cru, at 4 million euro. On 16 September 2012, Zhao Wei is admitted into the Jurade de <b>Saint-Émilion.</b> After 4 years of work, in October 2015, the winery launched the Bordeaux wine brand in the Chinese mass market. The online shop offers both high end and affordable wine selections.|$|E
25|$|The {{appellation}} (Image example: <b>Saint-Émilion)</b> Appellation d'origine contrôlée laws {{dictate that}} all grapes must be harvested {{from a particular}} appellation in order for that appellation {{to appear on the}} label. The appellation is a key indicator of the type of wine in the bottle. With the image example, Pauillac wines are always red, and usually Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety.|$|E
25|$|In the {{traditional}} Bordeaux blend, Merlot's {{role is to}} add body and softness. Despite accounting for 50-60% of overall plantings in Bordeaux, the grape tends to account {{for an average of}} 25% of the blends — especially in the Bordeaux wine regions of Graves and Médoc. Of these Left Bank regions, the commune of St-Estephe uses the highest percentage of Merlot in the blends. However, Merlot is much more prominent on the Right Bank of the Gironde in the regions of Pomerol and <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> where it will commonly comprise the majority of the blend. One of the most famous and rare wines in the world, Château Pétrus, is almost all Merlot. In Pomerol, where Merlot usually accounts for around 80% of the blend, the iron-clay soils of the region give Merlot more of a tannic backbone than what is found in other Bordeaux regions. It was in Pomerol that the garagistes movement began with small-scale production of highly sought after Merlot-based wines. In the sandy, clay-limestone-based soils of <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> Merlot accounts for around 60% of the blend and is usually blended with Cabernet Franc. In limestone, Merlot tends to develop more perfume notes while in sandy soils the wines are generally softer than Merlot grown in clay dominant soils.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} {{recognized}} as a distinct wine region apart from <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and the greater Libournais region by the French government in 1923 and was granted AOC status in 1936 {{as part of the}} first wave of AOC establishments by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO). While it {{is now one of the}} most prestigious of the Bordeaux AOCs, this situation is relatively recent, dating to the second half of the twentieth century, which is often given as one of the reasons why Pomerol is not included in any of the Bordeaux classifications.|$|E

25|$|The soils of the Pomerol {{region are}} very diverse {{with a mixture}} of gravel, sand and clay {{scattered}} across the plateau. Roughly speaking the vineyard soils to the north and east, closer to the border of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> tend to have more clay while the soils to the west and south become lighter and more gravelly. The plateau on which Pomerol sits is bordered by three rivers, the Barbanne to the north, the Isle to the west and Dordgogne and the city of Libourne to the south. As the terrain moves down the slopes of the plateau and towards these rivers the soils become more alluvial and sandy.|$|E
25|$|Pomerol lies {{immediately}} {{to the east and}} north-east of Libourne. Unlike most of the most prestigious communes of Bordeaux, it has no direct river access, being separated from the Dordogne to the south by the town and by <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> which lies to the south-east. To the north-east, across a stream called la Barbanne Rau lies Lalande-de-Pomerol. It stands on a gravel bank (a feature it shares with the prestigious appellations of the Médoc); towards the south and west, the soil is more sandy, while towards the north and east, it tends to clay. The sub-soil is dark packed clay, with a high iron content. The terrain is relatively flat with slight undulating slopes that fall from a height of 35-40 meters (115–130 feet) above sea level over a course of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to around 10 meters (33 feet).|$|E
25|$|Pomerol is the {{smallest}} of the major fine wine regions in Bordeaux, covering an area that is roughly three kilometers wide by 4 kilometers long. It is roughly one-seventh of the size of its much larger Right Bank neighbor <b>Saint-Émilion</b> AOC and is on par with {{the smallest}} Left Bank commune of Saint-Julien AOC in the Médoc. In 1998, there were 784 hectares of grape vines planted within the AOC boundaries producing 36,066 hectoliters (≈ 952,763 gallons or 400,733 cases) of wine. In 2003 there were 150 declared producers in Pomerol harvesting 780 ha and producing a year average of 32,250 hl (around 358,333 cases) of wine. Almost all the wine is estate-bottled. Unlike other French wine regions, such as Burgundy and the Rhône Valley, there are no co-operatives currently operating in Pomerol. By 2007, the number of planted hectares had risen slightly to 800 ha (1980 acres).|$|E
25|$|During the 13th century, the Graves was the {{principal}} wine region of Bordeaux. While there were some vines growing in the Entre-Deux-Mers, <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and Blaye, the Médoc during this period was virtually a barren marshland. At {{the turn of the}} 14th century, the town of Libourne was vying for dominance in the area, exporting 11,000 tons of wine to London from the 1308 vintage. A year earlier, this area fulfilled an order for 1,152,000 bottles to be used for the celebration of Edward II's wedding. The wine of this time period was highly alcoholic and fruity but did not age well, often spoiling a year after the vintage was released. The export of Bordeaux was effectively halted by the outbreak of The Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337 followed by the outbreak of the Black Death which ravaged the area. By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the more}} highly rated estates in Pomerol {{are located in the}} eastern half the region, up to the border of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> where the {{vineyards}} of the Premier Grand Cru Classé (A) estate of Château Cheval Blanc can often be seen from the Pomerol estates themselves. The southernmost reaches of Pomerol extend past the hamlet of Catusseau whereas just north of the hamlet the soil contains some of the finest gravel particles in the region. In the northeast is the hamlet of Maillet which borders the AOCs of Lalande-de-Pomerol, Montagne-Saint-Émilion and <b>Saint-Émilion</b> with the road running through the hamlet itself being the official boundary between Pomerol and <b>Saint-Émilion.</b> This has led to some legal issues as a few vineyards which are technically within the borders of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> but extend into Pomerol have had to be granted [...] "honorary citizenship of Pomerol".|$|E
2500|$|Red Libourne, or [...] "Right Bank" [...] wines. Around {{the city}} of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines {{dominated}} by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and Pomerol.

2500|$|Master of Wine Clive Coates {{describes}} Pomerols as a [...] "halfway house" [...] {{between the}} soft, plump, flesh fruit of a <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and the austerity and backbone {{associated with the}} wines of the Médoc.

This concentrated rich fruit stems from the nature of Merlot which also allows the wines of Pomerol to be less overtly tannic than the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines of the Médoc.|$|E
2500|$|The Bordeaux wine {{region is}} divided into subregions {{including}} <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> Pomerol, Médoc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness: ...|$|E
2500|$|The wine {{region of}} <b>Saint-Émilion</b> centres on the commune {{of the same}} name. There are several villages around the region that share the <b>Saint-Émilion</b> name, such as Montagne-Saint-Émilion and St-Georges-Saint-Émilion, and are {{permitted}} to label their wines under the same name. The area is bordered to the west by Pomerol. Merlot is the dominant grape in this area, followed by Cabernet Franc. The climate and damper, cool soils of the area {{makes it difficult for}} Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to fully ripen and as such is less often used. [...] The wines take a little longer to mature than the ones in Pomerol but are still able to be drunk relatively young for a Bordeaux (4–8 years). In favorable vintages the wines have a good aging potential.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Saint-Émilion</b> wines {{were first}} {{classified}} in 1878 {{and have been}} continuously revised with the most recent revision occurring in 2006. [...] Chateaux are divided into two First Growth classification-Premiers Grands Crus Classés A, which currently includes Château Ausone and Château Cheval Blanc, and Premiers Grands Crus Classés B which currently includes 13 chateaux such as Château Angélus and Château Figeac. Below the Premiers crus are the Grands Crus Classés which currently includes 55 chateaux. Estates can apply for classification by passing two tasting panels.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{very broad}} generalization, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines {{produced}} in the Médoc {{and the rest of}} the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Châteaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. [...] This is typically referred to as the [...] "Bordeaux Blend." [...] Merlot tends to predominate in <b>Saint-Émilion,</b> Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top-quality Châteaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} sub-regions within the Haut-Médoc, {{including}} St-Estèphe, Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux {{and the less}} well known areas of AOC Moulis and Listrac. [...] Graves includes the sub-regions of Pessac-Léognan and Sauternes (among others), and Sauternes in turn includes the sub-region of Barsac. [...] The Libournais includes the sub-regions of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> and Pomerol (among others). [...] There is an additional wine region of Entre-Deux-Mers, so called because it lies between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, which combine to form the Gironde. This region contains several less well known sweet wine areas of Cadillac and St. Croix de Mont.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of classifications of Bordeaux wines, {{covering}} different regions. None of these attempts to be a comprehensive classification of all the producers within a given area: rather, only the producers (universally known as châteaux, although not usually possessing the architectural grandeur that might imply) perceived as being of an unusually high standard are included in the classification. [...] The châteaux included in the classification are referred to as classed or classé, and those not included are referred to as unclassed. [...] Some classifications sub-divide the classed châteaux, according to the perceived quality. [...] On the Left Bank, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 is the starting point for classification. Although this purports to be a classification of all Bordeaux wine, it in fact exclusively lists red wine producers from the Haut-Médoc plus Château Haut-Brion of Graves, and (in a separate list) sweet white wine producers from Sauternes (including Barsac). Estates in the Médoc which were not classified in that listing may be classified under the Cru Bourgeois label. In 1953, a Classification of Graves wine was produced. Although this purports to classify the whole of Graves, it exclusively lists châteaux in Pessac-Léognan. In 1954, a separate classification of <b>Saint-Émilion</b> wine was set up for this Right Bank region.|$|E
