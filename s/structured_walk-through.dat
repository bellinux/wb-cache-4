The test will provide additional information regarding any further steps that {{may need to be}} included, changes in procedures that are not effective, and other appropriate adjustments. These may not become evident unless an actual dry-run test is performed. The plan is subsequently updated to correct any problems identified during the test. Initially, testing of the plan is done in sections and after normal business hours to minimize disruptions to the overall operations of the organization. As the plan is further polished, future tests occur during normal business hours.|$|E

Ideas {{to be discussed}} include {{the importance of a}} definitive problem formulation, discussions with subject-matter experts, interacting with the decision-maker on a regular basis, development of a written assumptions document, <b>structured</b> <b>walk-through</b> of the assumptions document, use of sensitivity analysis to determine important model factors, and comparison of model and system output data for an existing system (if any). Each idea will be illustrated by one or more real-world examples. We will also discuss the difficulty in using formal statistical techniques (e. g., confidence intervals) to validate simulation models. 1 WHAT IS MODEL VALIDATION Use of a simulation model is a surrogate for experimentation with the actual system (existing or proposed), which is usually disruptive, not cost-effective, or simple impossible. Thus, if the model is not a “close ” approximation to the actual system, any conclusions derived from the model are likely to be erroneous and may result in costly decisions being made. Validation should and can be done for all models, regardless of whether the corresponding system exists in some form or whether it will be built in the future. We now give definitions of validation and credibility. Validation is the process of determining whether a simulation model is an accurate representation of the system, for the particular objectives of the study. The following are some genera...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{structured}} programming {{has emerged as}} an advanced programming technology. During this time, many tools {{have been developed for}} facilitating the programmer % use of ‘structured programming. One of these tools, the Structured Flowcharts developed by I. Nassi and B. Shneiderman in 1972, is proving its value in both the design phase and the coding phase of program development. Several programming groups in System Products Division, Endicott, New York, have used the Nassi-Shneiderman charts as replacements for conventional flowcharts in structuring programs. The charts have been used extensively on some projects for <b>structured</b> <b>walk-throughs,</b> design reviews, and education. This paper describes the Nassi-Shneiderman charts and provides explanations of their use in programming, in development process control, in walkthroughs, and in testing. It includes an analysis of the value of Nassi-Shneiderman charts compared to other design and documentation methods such as pseudo-code, HIP 0 charts, prose, and flowcharts, as well as the authors’ experiences in using the Nassi-Shneiderman charts. The paper is intended for a general data processing audience and although no special’knowledge is required, familiarity with structured programming concepts would be helpful. The reader should gain insight into the use of Nassi-Shneiderman charts as part of the total development process...|$|R
