40|$|The {{advent of}} agile methodologies {{has brought about}} an {{illuminating}} debate in Software Engineering, {{particularly with regard to}} software quality. Some studies have reported that agile methodologies do improve software quality when compared to traditional methodologies; other studies have been inconclusive or contradictory, while others have argued that empirical evidence is limited. This study sought to investigate the correlation between agile methodologies when compared to traditional methodologies for selected software quality parameters. The research design was causal comparative, as well as correlational. The approach was quantitative, using a survey as the data collection method. SPSS was used to conduct descriptive and correlational analysis for 106 responses received. The main findings were that there was a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between traditional methodology use and ease of system testing (p= 0. 014); a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between traditional methodology use and timeliness (p= 0. 02); a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between software quality standards used and ease of system testing (p= 0. 017); a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between active stakeholder participation on projects and ease of system interactivity (p= 0. 047); and a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between mandatory workshop interactivity (p= 0. 047); and a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between mandatory workshop attendance or training and ease of system navigation (p= 0. 031). Claims that agile methodology use leads to improved software quality for selected quality parameters could not be empirically validated. The association between most of the selected software quality criteria in relation to methodology use in general was not apparent. Agile methodologies are suitable in small environments. Scrum was the most widely used agile methodology by far. The popularity and adoption state of XP showed a significantly decreasing trend. Traditional and agile methodologies combined are being used (47 %) more than any other methodology. Agile methodology use (28 %) surpassed traditional methodology use (19 %). A suitable consensus definition for agile methodologies did not emerge from the data collected. The most suitable project life cycle model was evolutionary, incremental and iterative. ‘Other’ methodologies, meaning customised agile or SDLC, are suitable, as the environment becomes increasingly large and complex. Only 13 % of organisations surveyed have an agile experience of six years and beyond. Based on these findings and gaps in the literature, implications and recommendations for further research areas are proposed, where the findings and contributions of this study are found to be relevant to practice for application and to academia for further researchCollege of Engineering, Science and TechnologyM.

40|$|Abstract Background Endometrial {{carcinoma}} (EC) is {{the most}} common malignancy of the female genital tract. Gene alterations and overexpression of various oncogenes are important in tumor development. The human HER 2 neu (c-erbB- 2) gene product is a transmembrane receptor with an intracellular tyrosine kinase that {{plays an important role in}} coordinating the endometrial growth factor receptor signaling network. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of c-erbB- 2 in endometrial cancer, to study its correlation to established prognostic parameters and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Methods Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of ER, PR and c-erbB- 2 were performed in 72 EC cases. Results We detected a positive staining with c erbB 2 in 18. 1 % of the cases and determined a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between c-erbB- 2 and PR. We could not find a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between c-erbB- 2 staining and ER. There was not a statistically significant difference between c-erbB- 2 and histological grade. The highest level of c-erbB- 2 was found in grade 2 cases. There was not any <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between c-erbB- 2 and menstrual status, myometrial invasion, lymph node status, stage and survival.

40|$|Background: Prevalence of {{hyperglycemia}} in preterm infants {{varies widely}} between 20 % and 88 %. Hyperglycaemia in very {{low birth weight}} infants (VLBW) is associated with increased morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage,) and mortality. Objective: To study the incidence of hyperglycemia in VLBW infants and the correlation between hyperglycemia and different neonatal parameters, antenatal as well as postnatal risk factors, complications and outcome. The study also aimed at studying {{the relation between the}} onset and degree of hyperglycemia and different study parameters. Methodology: This cross-sectional comparative study included 60 VLBW neonates admitted since birth in Abulrich new Children Hospital NICU, Egypt. Random blood glucose (BG) was measured during 1 st week of life (checked every 3  h in the 1 st 48  h, then every 6  h for the next 5  days) using glucometer strips. Thorough maternal history taking, neonatal assessment and recording of medications, nutrition and IV fluid intake during 1 st week of life as well as development of complications. Results: Forty VLBW neonates (66. 7 %) developed hyperglycemia during 1 st week of life. Among hyperglycemic cases 20 neonates (50 %) developed severe hyperglycemia while 16 (40 %) developed moderate hyperglycemia and only 4 (10 %) had mild hyperglycemia. There was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between hyperglycemia and gestational age, birth weight, placental insufficiency during pregnancy, receiving inotropes and milk intake after birth (p =  0. 05, 0. 042, 0. 044, 0. 001 and 0. 007 respectively). There was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> between hyperglycemia and LOS, IVH, death (p =  0. 001, 0. 003 & 0. 022 respectively).

Materials and Methods: This study involved 138 patients with obstructive uropathy with age ranged from 2 months to 73 years. Patients classified into two groups: Group (I) : Includes 57 patients (41. 3 %), ureteric stents fixed to them; and Group (II) : Includes 81 patients (58. 6 %) managed by other treatment modalities. All patients underwent clinical assessment, Laboratory and radiologic investigations: At presentation and postoperative.

Results: Renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was used as an indicator for improvement of renal function after fixation of ureteric stent.

The possibility to alter and adapt behavior to different life situations largely depends on the ability to inhibit unwanted or inappropriate behaviors. This research was conducted with the aim to determine the relation between inhibitory control and behavioral problems in children with mild intellectual disability. The sample consists of 56 children with mild intellectual disability of both genders (IQ 50 - 70, AM= 60. 27; SD= 7. 106), from four Belgrade elementary schools. The data on age and intellectual abilities were collected by analyzing the school records. The data on behavioral problems were obtained by means of standardized interviews with special educators, applying the II part of AAMR Adaptive Behavior Scale. Inhibitory control was assessed by Go/No-Go task which has two parts (conflicting replies and reply delay). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used in statistical analysis of the results. No <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relation</b> was determined between the Maladaptive Behavior Scale scores and the IQ, age and gender.

The abundances of K, Na, and Mg were determined using high-resolution 2 df spectra obtained with the AAT. The 1 D NLTE abundance estimates were obtained using 1 D hydrostatic ATLAS 9 model atmospheres and spectral line profiles synthesized with the MULTI package. We also used 3 D hydrodynamical CO 5 BOLD and 1 D hydrostatic LHD model atmospheres to compute 3 D- 1 D LTE abundance corrections, Δ_ 3 D- 1 D LTE, for the spectral lines of Na, Mg, and K used in our study. These abundance corrections were used to understand the role of convection in the formation of spectral lines, as well as to estimate the differences in the abundances obtained with the 3 D hydrodynamical and 1 D hydrostatic model atmospheres. The average element-to-iron abundance ratios and their RMS variations due to star-to-star abundance spreads determined in our sample of RGB stars were 〈 [Na/Fe]〉^ 1 D NLTE= 0. 42 ± 0. 13, 〈 [Mg/Fe]〉^ 1 D NLTE= 0. 41 ± 0. 11, and 〈 [K/Fe]〉^ 1 D NLTE= 0. 05 ± 0. 14.
