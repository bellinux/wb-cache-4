The kind-hearted young man picked out a lump of meat, went to the door, and threw it outside to him. The dog pounced upon it, and gulped it down greedily, and was just turning to go, when it <b>staggered,</b> fell, <b>rolled</b> over, and died. Nur Mahomed, who had been lazily watching him, stood still for a moment, then he came back whistling softly. He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere; and then he sent back the empty plates.|$|R

60|$|What {{should he}} do? Give horrible shrieks {{as if he}} were in pain? But the Bad One would not care whether he were murdered or not! Call him by his name?
