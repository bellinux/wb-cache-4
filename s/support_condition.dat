40|$|The thermal {{buckling}} and postbuckling response of symmetrically laminated composite plates are discussed. Using variational methods {{in conjunction with}} a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation, {{thermal buckling}} and postbuckling are investigated for two laminates, a (+/- 45 / 0 / 90) and a (+/- 45 / 02), under two different simple <b>support</b> <b>conditions,</b> fixed and sliding. These laminates are subjected to the condition of a uniform temperature change. The effects of the principal material axis not being aligned with the edges of the plate, referred to here as material axis skewing, are also investigated. Although differences between buckling temperatures for the two <b>support</b> <b>conditions</b> were small, <b>support</b> <b>conditions</b> can have a large influence on thermal postbuckling response. In general, plates with fixed simple supports deflect more than plates with sliding simple supports. In addition, <b>support</b> <b>conditions</b> can influence modal interaction. Skewing of the material axis decreases the buckling temperatures of both laminates and, like fixed <b>support</b> <b>conditions,</b> causes increased postbuckling deflections.

40|$|Considerable {{research}} has shown {{a positive relationship between}} social support provided by other group members and resilience. However, recent {{research has}} suggested that social support may not be a necessary condition for this positive relationship to be observed. That is, group membership in and of itself may be sufficient to promote resilience in the face of challenges. This study aimed to tease apart the relative contribution of social support and group membership to resilience and explore the mechanisms through which social support might increase resilience. The study focused on two resilience tasks — increasing pain involved in a hand press task and perseverance on an unsolvable anagram. Participants (N = 62) were asked to think of an interaction with their most important group when social support was either a) needed and provided (group and <b>support</b> <b>condition)</b> b) needed but not provided (group without <b>support</b> <b>condition)</b> or c) when only thinking of a positive interaction with their group (group only condition). Greater resilience on the anagram task was shown by those in the group and <b>support</b> <b>condition</b> compared to the group without <b>support</b> <b>condition.</b> It was also found that resilience was higher in the group only condition than the group without <b>support</b> <b>condition,</b> although this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, these effects were not mediated by self-concept clarity, general self-efficacy or affect. Greater levels of perceived isolation were found in the group without <b>support</b> <b>condition.</b> Analysis revealed isolation was not a mediator of the relationship between social support conditions and persistence on the anagram task. It is argued that group membership in and of itself appears to {{have a positive effect on}} resilience. However, a more positive effect is seen when that group provides social support when it is needed...|$|E

40|$|Railway {{sleepers}} {{have important}} roles in the complex railway system. Due to different loading condition, poor maintenance of sleeper or bad quality of ballast, a random load distribution along the sleeper-ballast interface may occur. A sleeper design, and also the track system design, which do not consider the random load distribution, could influence {{the performance of the}} sleeper and even damage the whole railway system. Thus, a numerical static and dynamic analysis for a pre-stressed concrete mono-block railway sleeper is carried out using finite element method. The structural behaviour of a single sleeper subjected to a random sleeper-ballast interaction is studied in three steps. First, four typical scenarios of <b>support</b> <b>condition</b> for sleeper are discussed in numerical analysis. Second, large enough numerical results under different random support conditions are conducted.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{proposes a}} method to detect damage in bridges from the changes in natural frequencies. This research topic {{has been the subject}} of considerable investigation over the past few decades, owing to the increasing number of ageing bridges. Many works in the literature on this topic show excellent damage detection results. However, these attempts have suffered from the difficulty that the effect of changes in <b>supporting</b> <b>conditions,</b> owing to ageing on the natural frequencies, is much larger than that of damage in bridge members, including beams. Thus, it is not easy to identify the damage by this procedure if the <b>supporting</b> <b>conditions</b> are changed. In order to eliminate the bottleneck, this research attempts to clarify how much the change in <b>supporting</b> <b>conditions</b> affects the natural frequencies of several modes, including pure bending mode and torsional mode.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} experimental studies {{on the effect of}} real <b>support</b> <b>conditions</b> on the shear strength of hollow flange channel beams, known as LiteSteel beams (LSB). The LSB has a unique shape of a channel beam with two rectangular hollow flanges, made using a unique manufacturing process. In many applications in the building industry LSBs are used with only one web side plate (WSP) at their supports. The WSPs are also often not full height plates. Past research studies showed that these real support connections did not provide the required simply <b>supported</b> <b>conditions.</b> Many studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of LSBs with simply <b>supported</b> <b>conditions</b> subject to pure bending and predominant shear actions. To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the effect of real <b>support</b> <b>conditions</b> on the shear strength of LSBs. Hence a detailed experimental study based on 25 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs with real <b>support</b> <b>conditions.</b> Simply <b>supported</b> test specimens of LSBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. It was found that the effect of using one WSP on the shear behaviour of LSB is significant and there is about 25 % shear capacity reduction due to the lateral movement of the bottom flange at the supports. Shear capacity of LSB was also found to decrease when full height WSPs were not used. Suitably improved support connections were developed to improve the shear capacity of LSBs based on test results. Details of the recommended support connections and shear capacity results are given in this paper...|$|R
