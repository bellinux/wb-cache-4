In relation to crops in untreated control soil, delving increased wheat yield from 1. 9 to 3. 1 t/ha in 2003, and from 0. 5 to 1. 5 t/ha in 2004. This large delving effect contrasted with the minor effects of other treatments including <b>soil</b> <b>rolling,</b> sowing rate, row spacing, and cultivar mixture.

40|$|Introduction: Rolling {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the most substantial energy losses when the wheel moves on soft <b>soil.</b> <b>Rolling</b> resistance value optimization will help to improve energy efficiency. Accurate modeling of the interaction soil-tire is an important key to this optimization and has eliminated the need for costly field tests and has reduced the time required to test. Rolling resistance will change because of the tire and wheel motion parameters and characteristics of the ground surface. Some tire design parameters are more important such as the tire diameter, width, tire aspect ratio, lugs form, inflation pressure and mechanical properties of tire structure. On the other hand, the soil or ground surface characteristics include soil type; moisture content and bulk density have an important role in this phenomenon. In addition, the vertical load and the wheel motion parameters such as velocity and tire slip are the other factors which impact on tire rolling resistance. According to same studies about the rolling resistance of the wheel, the wheel is significantly affected by the dynamic load. Tire inflation pressure impacted on rolling resistance of tires that were moving on hard surfaces. Studies showed that the rolling resistance of tires with low inflation pressure (less than 100 kPa) was too high. According to Zoz and Griss researches, increasing the tire pressure increases rolling resistance on soft soil but reduces the rolling resistance of on-road tires and tire-hard surface interaction. Based on these reports, the effect of velocity on tire rolling resistance for tractors and vehicles with low velocity (less than 5 meters per second) is usually insignificant. According to Self and Summers studies, rolling resistance of the wheel is dramatically affected by dynamic load on the wheel. Artificial Neural Network {{is one of the}} best computational methods capable of complex regression estimation which is an advantage of this method compared with the analytical and statistical methods. It is expected that the neural network can more accurately predict the rolling resistance. In this study, the neural network for experimental data was trained and the relationship among some parameters of velocity, dynamic load and tire pressure and rolling resistance were evaluated. Materials and Methods: The soil bin and single wheel tester of Biosystem Engineering Mechanics Department of Urmia University was used in this study. This soil bin has 24 m length, 2 m width and 1 m depth including a single-wheel tester and the carrier. Tester consists of four horizontal arms and a vertical arm to vertical load. The S-shaped load cells were employed in horizontal arms with a load capacity of 200 kg and another 500 kg in the vertical arm was embedded. The tire used in this study was a general pneumatic tire (Good year 9. 5 L- 14, 6 ply) In this study, artificial neural networks were used for optimizing the rolling resistance by 35 neurons, 6 inputs and 1 output choices.

40|$|One of {{the major}} sources of loss when a vehicle is {{traversing}} terrain – especially on soft <b>soil</b> – is <b>rolling</b> resistance. Many workers have attempted theoretical and practical definitions of this. They have usually examined {{the magnitude of the}} deformation of tire and <b>soil</b> during <b>rolling</b> under steady-state conditions. However, the magnitude of rolling resistance continually varies during motion. The unevenness of the terrain and the inhomogeneity of the soil give rise to substantial vertical vibrations which change the magnitude of deformations, and thus rolling resistance. The effect of these vibrations must therefore be taken into account. This paper reports a determination of rolling resistance components through field experiments designed to distinguish rolling resistance losses from other tire-soil interaction losses (slip). Soil and tire deformation losses were determined separately. The experiment involved measurement of vertical acceleration at the wheel center. The acceleration and mass data yielded the dynamic load ΔQ = m⋅a which is superposed on the static weight of the vehicle and continually alters the magnitude of the soil and tire deformation and thus the rolling resistance. The test results permitted four components of rolling resistance to be determined. These are (1) soil deformation, (2) tire deformation, (3) the additional soil deformation caused by the dynamic load and (4) the additional tire deformation from the same cause. Tire deformation was responsible for 39 % and soil deformation for 37 % of rolling resistance in the experimental vehicle and soil conditions. The additional tire losses accounted for 5 % of rolling resistance and the additional soil losses 8 %. The remaining 11 % of rolling resistance consisted of other – individually negligible – losses such as air resistance, which were not separately distinguished. The measurements were checked against energy (power) measurements from torque and speed sensors, and these confirmed the rolling resistance calculations...|$|R

The laws evaluating separately the losses on the hysteresis in the tyre and on the deformation of <b>soil</b> considering the <b>rolling</b> conditions: the driven, the driving have been revealed; the main requirements to be submitted for the METM at its building-block principles with the different kinds of the agricultural technique have been formulated. The main results of the investigations are accepted for use in the Scientific Research Tractor InstituteAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|This PNVG is {{developed}} specific to north central Minnesota outwash plains in {{the proximity of}} the Chippewa National Forest. Landscape is level to <b>rolling.</b> <b>Soil</b> structure is comprised mostly of loamy sand. Local water table is generally more than 100 cm below the soil surface. Soils are moderately to excessively drained. Soil moisture is moderately dry. Vegetation Description Historically, this PNVG had a jack pine, red pine, and white pine supercanopy either alone or as mixed pines. Deciduous trees usually occurred as a subcanopy comprised of quaking aspen, paper birch, northern red oak, bur oak, red maple, and bigtooth aspen. These deciduous trees grow to merchantable size and, in the absence of pines, the deciduous trees would form a cover type. The mature condition was typically a mix of pines and deciduous trees, frequently with two pine species and a subordinate canopy of three deciduous species. The pine coverage would be 50 % to 75 %, with the deciduous species making up the balance. Vertical diversity is definitely a part of these mature and older forests in this system. Oak species and red maple are present at higher levels than aspen and birch in the seedling/sapling size class. This suggests the oak and maple will replace the shorter-lived aspen-birch as the stand ages. Pine species are only a minor part of the understory stocking. Beaked hazel is the dominant shrub. Large leaved aster is the most commonly found forb...|$|R
5000|$|Gampola, or {{so called}} Gangasiripura {{because of the}} Mahaweli (Mahaweli Ganga) flowing by its side, is a {{beautiful}} town itself stands 300 - 500 m altitude, situated in a valley surrounded by hills and located near to Kandy. Geologically the region belongs to the Highland Complex of Sri Lanka and major rock formation is Precambrian charnockite gneiss with strips of quartz and biotite gneiss here and there. Soil profile of the region could identify as Red Yellow Podzolic soils and Mountain Regosols. Mean annual rainfall is in between 3000 - 3500 mm and mean annual temperature is in between 20-25 C. Due to the geomorphology of the Gampola and its vicinity, which characterised by steep hills stand from plain, it was declared as a landslide prone area. However, with its flat terrain with being a catchment area of River Mahaweli, our region has become highly used in agricultural purposes both in traditional (paddy, chena, home gardens) and industrial plantations (majorly tea). Tea, natural forests, mixed home gardens, steeply dissected hilly and <b>rolling,</b> <b>soil</b> profile with the prominent A1 horizon and lithosol soils are can consider as its unique ecological background. Administratively, Gampola is an urban council belongs to the Kandy district of Central Province [...] In traditional administration region system, it once belonged to the Maya rata before the 13th cent. AD and in Kandy period to the Ganga Pahala Koralaya of Uda Palatha of Kandy district [...]|$|R
