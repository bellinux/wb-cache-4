25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail <b>suspension</b> <b>test.</b> In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E
25|$|Sensorimotor {{deficits and}} neurochemical changes were {{observed}} in rats that were exposed to low doses of 56Fe-ions. Doses that are below 1 Gy reduce performance, as tested by the wire <b>suspension</b> <b>test.</b> Behavioral changes were observed as early as 3 days after radiation exposure and lasted up to 8 months. Biochemical studies showed that the K+-evoked release of dopamine was significantly reduced in the irradiated group, together with an alteration of the nerve signaling pathways. A negative result was reported by Pecaut et al., in which no behavioral effects were seen in female C57/BL6 mice in a 2- to 8-week period following their exposure to 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 2 Gy accelerated 56Fe-ions (1 GeV/u56Fe) as measured by open-field, rotorod, or acoustic startle habituation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hibiscus tiliaceus L. (Malvaceae) {{is used in}} {{postpartum}} disorders. Our {{purpose was}} to examine the antidepressant, anxiolytic and sedative actions of the methanol extract of H. tiliaceus flowers using animal models. Methods Adult male Swiss albino mice were treated with saline, standard drugs or methanol extract of H. tiliaceus and then subjected to behavioral tests. The forced swimming and tail <b>suspension</b> <b>tests</b> were used as predictive animal models of antidepressant activity, where the time of immobility was considered. The animals were submitted to the elevated plus-maze and ketamine-induced sleeping time to assess anxiolytic and sedative activities, respectively. Results Methanol extract of H. tiliaceus significantly decreased the duration of immobility in both animal models of antidepressant activity, forced swimming and tail <b>suspension</b> <b>tests.</b> This extract did not potentiate the effect of ketamine-induced hypnosis, as determined by the time to onset and duration of sleeping time.

Methods: The husk extract (187 - 748 mg/kg) was evaluated for antidepressant activity in mice using open field, force swimming and tail <b>suspension</b> <b>tests.</b> Determination of median lethal dose (LD 50) and phytochemical screening of the husk extract were also carried out using standard methods. Results: The husk extract increased significantly the line crossing, walling and rearing activities of mice in open field test (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001) and reduced significantly the immobility time in force swimming test (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001). However, the immobility time in tail <b>suspension</b> <b>tests</b> was significantly increased by the extract (P< 0. 05 - 0. 001). Conclusion: The husk extract of Z. mays has prominent antidepressant activity which is due to the activities of its phytochemical constituents such as phenolic compounds...|$|R

A 549 {{cells were cultured in}} the air–liquid interface, exposed to nanoparticle aerosols and characterized by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance and staining for tight junction proteins.

Exposure by itself in both exposure systems did not damage the cells. Deposition rates of aerosolized polystyrene particles were about 700 times and that of carbon nanotubes about 4 times higher in the MicroSprayer than in the VITROCELL® 6 PT-CF system. Cytotoxicity of amine-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticles was significantly higher when applied as an aerosol on cell cultured in air–liquid interface culture compared with nanoparticle <b>suspensions</b> <b>tested</b> in submersed culture.
