5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} <b>such</b> <b>techniques</b> as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included <b>such</b> <b>techniques</b> as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} {{narrative}} writing, {{in this passage}} and throughout the piece, was alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing.

5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. <b>Such</b> <b>techniques</b> involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; <b>such</b> <b>techniques</b> included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E

Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
