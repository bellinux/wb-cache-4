25|$|Fraenkel et al. (1973, pp.303304) {{explain why}} Skolem's result was <b>so</b> <b>surprising</b> to set theorists in the 1920s. Gödel's {{completeness}} theorem and the compactness theorem were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated {{the way that}} first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although Gödel's original proof of the completeness theorem was complicated. Leon Henkin's alternative proof of the completeness theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first-order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using higher-order logic with full semantics then {{it does not have}} any countable models, due to the semantics being used.|$|E
500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. [...] On breaking apart the plaster {{it was found that}} veins of copper were formed running right through it. [...] <b>So</b> <b>surprising</b> was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments sometimes get him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending <b>so</b> <b>surprising</b> you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|The Celtics were {{ahead by}} nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain {{had left the}} game with an injured leg. West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked {{to return to the}} game. However, Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept Chamberlain on the bench {{until the end of the}} game, saying later that he wanted to stay with the lineup {{responsible}} for the comeback. The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years. At age 35, Russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last NBA game. After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West (who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team), clasped his hand and tried to soothe him. Days later, 30,000 enthusiastic Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes, but Russell was not there: the man who said he owed the public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics. It came as <b>so</b> <b>surprising</b> that even Red Auerbach was blindsided, and as a consequence, he made the [...] "mistake" [...] of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center. Although White became a standout Celtics player, the Celtics lacked an All-Star center, went just 34–48 in the next season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1950. In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed, because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for $10,000 to Sports Illustrated. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary.|$|E

2500|$|Astaire's {{execution}} of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew {{from a variety of}} influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his [...] "outlaw style," [...] an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As Jerome Robbins stated, [...] "Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is <b>so</b> <b>surprising</b> and inventive." [...] Astaire further observed: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{universal}} absorber {{theory is}} {{mentioned in the}} chapter titled [...] "Monster Minds" [...] in Feynman's autobiographical work Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and in Vol. II of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. It led to the formulation of a framework of quantum mechanics using a Lagrangian and action as starting points, rather than a Hamiltonian, namely the formulation using Feynman path integrals, which proved useful in Feynman's earliest calculations in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory in general. Both retarded and advanced fields appear respectively as retarded and advanced propagators {{and also in the}} Feynman propagator and the Dyson propagator. In hindsight, the relationship between retarded and advanced potentials shown here is not <b>so</b> <b>surprising</b> {{in view of the fact}} that, in field theory, the advanced propagator can be obtained from the retarded propagator by exchanging the roles of field source and test particle (usually within the kernel of a Green's function formalism). In field theory, advanced and retarded fields are simply viewed as mathematical solutions of Maxwell's equations whose combinations are decided by the boundary conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} to observe the rings of Saturn in 1610 using his telescope, but was unable to {{identify}} them as such. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany that [...] "The planet Saturn is not alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the zodiac, and the middle one (Saturn itself) is about {{three times the size of}} the lateral ones." [...] He also described the rings as Saturn's [...] "ears". In 1612 the Earth passed through the plane of the rings and they became invisible. Mystified, Galileo remarked [...] "I do not know what to say in a case <b>so</b> <b>surprising,</b> so unlooked for and so novel." [...] He mused, [...] "Has Saturn swallowed his children?" [...] — referring to the myth of the Titan Saturn devouring his offspring to forestall the prophecy of them overthrowing him. He was further confused when the rings again became visible in 1613.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of 1812, Miller raised a company of local men and traveled to Burlington, Vermont. He transferred to the 30th Infantry Regiment in the regular army of the United States with the rank of lieutenant. Miller spent most of the war working as a recruiter and on February 1, 1814, he was promoted to captain. He saw his first action at the Battle of Plattsburgh, where vastly outnumbered American forces overcame the British. [...] "The fort I was in was exposed to every shot. Bombs, rockets, and shrapnel shells fell as thick as hailstones", he said. One of these many shots had exploded two feet from him, wounding three of his men and killing another, but Miller survived without a scratch. Miller came to view the outcome of this battle as miraculous, and therefore at odds with his deistic view of a distant God far removed from human affairs. He later wrote, [...] "It seemed to me that the Supreme Being must have watched over the interests of this country in an especial manner, and delivered us from the hands of our enemies... <b>So</b> <b>surprising</b> a result, against such odds, did seem to me like the work of a mightier power than man." ...|$|E
