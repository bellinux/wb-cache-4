5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism. The YMCA was an early promoter of reforms for young men {{with a focus on}} social welfare and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development.|$|E

In 2009, Hangul was unofficially adopted by the town of Bau-Bau, in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to write the Cia-Cia language. A number of Indonesian Cia-Cia speakers who visited Seoul generated large media attention in South Korea, and they were greeted on their arrival by Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul. It was confirmed in October 2012 that the {{attempts to}} disseminate Hangul in Indonesia failed. But there are still <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> use Hangul at home or co-officially.|$|E

[...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record.

500|$|Fleming stated he was {{impressed}} by Love's [...] "focus and intensity," [...] especially while recording vocals for one song when Love [...] "literally ripped her clothes off while she sang". [...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', and I loved that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.|$|E
500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among <b>Some</b> <b>People,</b> <b>that</b> you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the commentaries {{published}} in [...] "El Regañón de La Habana", {{it can be}} concluded that those [...] "guarachas" [...] were very popular within the Havana population at that time, because in the same previously mentioned article the author says: [...] "…but most importantly, what bothers me most is the liberty with which a number of chants are sung throughout the streets and town homes, where innocence is insulted and morals offended… by many individuals, not just of the lowest class, but also by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are supposed to be called well educated..." [...] Therefore, {{it can be said that}} those [...] "guarachas" [...] of a very audacious content, were apparently already sung within a wide social sector of the Havana population.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas biographer Scott Douglas Gerber has {{opined that}} attacks against Thomas from critics such as Jeffrey Toobin have been unusually vitriolic. Gerber {{provides}} many reasons {{but the first}} and foremost was his skin color. [...] Gerber has outlined other reasons. The second reason Gerber attributes in part to liberals' disappointment that Thomas has departed so much from the jurisprudence of the African American whom he succeeded, Thurgood Marshall. Additional possible causes for the harsh criticism of Thomas may be the inherently explosive nature of sexual misconduct accusations, the suspicion among <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> Thomas was less than forthcoming during his confirmation hearings, and the belief in some circles that Thomas has benefited from affirmative action programs like ones he has criticized as a judge.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a {{commission}} to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations. Oberg said that he meant to finish the book. In November 2002, Peter Jennings said [...] "NASA is {{going to spend a}} few thousand dollars trying to prove to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," [...] and [...] "NASA had been so rattled, [...] hired [...] to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists." [...] Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed {{that she would be}} taking her time recording her fifth studio album, stating: [...] "It's just really about the vibe, and I'll just tell you that it's a good vibe going. It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy." [...] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In {{an interview}}, Ciara said [...] "I worked with <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are very fresh, which I'm excited about...

2500|$|In Malta, however, Catholic bishops opposed {{efforts to}} remove {{homosexual}} acts from the criminal code; something which was finally done in 1973. In New Zealand, Cardinal Williams issued in 1985 a statement opposing homosexual law reform, arguing that [...] "to decriminalize homosexuality could suggest to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> it was morally and socially permissible"; but the Church there declined {{to submit a}} formal response to the parliamentary enquiry. In later years, the local Catholic Church opposed or took action against decriminalization of homosexuality in Belize. In [...] India, too, the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council opposed decriminalisation, but Cardinal Oswald Gracias, a President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India {{and one of the}} eight members of Pope Francis's Council of Cardinal Advisers, declared it wrong to make gay people criminals, since the Catholic Church [...] "teaches that homosexuals have the same dignity of every human being and condemns all forms of unjust discrimination, harassment or abuse". Homosexuality remains illegal in India, but in 2016 Belize decriminalized homosexuality through a court ruling.|$|E
2500|$|The vows and pledges being annulled by this {{ceremony}} {{are of a}} limited category. As the ArtScroll Mahzor explains it: [...] "There is a dangerous and erroneous misconception among <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the Kol Nidrei nullification of vows—whether past or future—... gives people the right to break their word or to make insincere promises that will have no legal force. This is not the case. The Kol Nidrei declaration can invalidate only vows that one undertakes on his own volition. It {{has no effect on}} vows or oath imposed by someone else, or a court. Also, the invalidation of future vows takes effect only if someone makes the vow without having in mind his previous Kol Nidrei declaration. But if he makes the vow with Kol Nidrei in mind—thus being openly insincere in his vow—the vow is in full force." [...] Moreover, as Rabbi Yechiel of Paris explained in a Disputation that took place before the King and Queen of France in 1240, [...] "Only the erroneously broken vows are annulled, that nobody might commit the sin of intentionally breaking vows." ...|$|E

2500|$|The SAT {{has been}} renamed several times since its {{introduction}} in 1926. It was originally {{known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1990, a commission {{set up by the}} College Board to review the proposed changes to the SAT program recommended that the meaning of the initialism SAT be changed to [...] "Scholastic Assessment Test" [...] because a [...] "test that integrates measures of achievement as well as developed ability can no longer be accurately described as a test of aptitude". In 1993, the College Board changed the name of the test to SAT I: Reasoning Test; at the same time, the name of the Achievement Tests was changed to SAT II: Subject Tests. The Reasoning Test and Subject Tests were to be collectively known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests. According {{to the president of the}} College Board at the time, the name change was meant [...] "to correct the impression among <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the SAT measures something that is innate and impervious to change regardless of effort or instruction." [...] The new SAT debuted in March 1994, and was referred to as the Scholastic Assessment Test by major news organizations. However, in 1997, the College Board announced that the SAT could not properly be called the Scholastic Assessment Test, and that the letters SAT did not stand for anything. In 2004, the Roman numeral in SAT I: Reasoning Test was dropped, making SAT Reasoning Test the new name of the SAT.|$|E
2500|$|Sally Bedell Smith characterised Diana as unpredictable, egocentric, and possessive. Smith {{also argued}} that in her desire to do charity works she was [...] "motivated by {{personal}} considerations, rather than by an ambitious urge {{to take on a}} societal problem". Robinson, however, said that [...] " [...] was serious about the causes she espoused". According to Sarah Bradford, Diana looked down on the House of Windsor whom she reportedly viewed [...] "as jumped-up foreign princelings" [...] and called them [...] "the Germans". She believed that Diana was a [...] "victim of her own poor judgment" [...] as she lost a social privilege by doing the Panorama interview. Some observers characterised her as a manipulative person. It was also alleged by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the Princess and her former father-in-law, Prince Philip, had a relationship filled with tension. Other observers, however, said that their letters provided no indication of friction between them. Author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana in fact has not put any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who also noted in his article that Diana's memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while Peter Conrad, another Guardian contributor, argued that even in [...] "a decade after her death, she is still not silent", and Allan Massie of The Telegraph described the Princess as [...] "the celebrity of celebrities" [...] whose sentiments [...] "continue to shape our society".|$|E
