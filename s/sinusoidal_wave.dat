2500|$|The {{sinusoid}} {{is defined}} for {{all times and}} distances, whereas in physical situations we usually deal with waves that exist for a limited span in space and duration in time. Fortunately, an arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves {{by the use of}} Fourier analysis. As a result, the simple case of a single <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>wave</b> can be applied to more general cases. In particular, many media are linear, or nearly so, so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the superposition principle to find the solution for a general waveform.
