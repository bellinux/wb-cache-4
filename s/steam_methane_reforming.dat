40|$|The {{intrinsic}} kinetics and diffusion behaviour of <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> {{have been}} investigated in this work. Measurements of effective diffusivities of the gases present in <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> {{have been carried out}} by using the steady-state technique over wide ranges of temperature and pressure in a modified Wicke-Kallenbach (W-K) type diffusion apparatus. The effects of diffusion limitation on the reactions were examined at atmospheric pressure in a pellet reactor; and the intrinsic kinetics of <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> have been studied on a commercial nickel/alumina catalyst (ICI 57 - 4) in an integral reactor. A simulation study has been carried out {{to determine the effects of}} hydrogen removal on the performance of a membrane reactor and the catalyst activity for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming.</b> For the measurements of effective diffusivities, the temperature and pressure dependencies of effective diffusivities of gases measured have been obtained, and the tortuosities of pellets used for the gases measured have been estimated by using the parallel path pore model. At ambient pressure, the temperature exponent values range from 1. 0 to 1. 25. This indicates that the diffusion occurs in the transition region. At pressures up to 1 MPa, the diffusion lies mainly in the bulk diffusion region. The pressure exponent was generally less than 1. 0 with values lying between 0. 4 and 0. 85 except for gas-water vapour pairs where it is close to 1. 0. The tortuosities estimated for the pellets varied from 1. 84 to 2. 51 for different gases at ambient pressure, but decreased with increase in pressure. Using the pellet reactor that couples the diffusion and reaction for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> experimental results, which were obtained over catalyst pellets without holes, show that the diffusion rate of methane into the catalyst pellets almost totally controlled the reaction rate. Under such diffusion limitation, other conditions did not show any apparent effects on the reaction. For catalyst pellets that contained four holes, the diffusion limitation on reaction was considerably reduced. However, catalyst activity did not play an important role in affecting the reaction. It was found that the effects of diffusion limitation on the catalyst pellet with a higher activity are greater than on catalyst pellet with a lower activity. For the study of the intrinsic kinetics of <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> the effects of temperature, pressure, and ratio of steam/methane on reactions {{have been investigated}} experimentally under condition of no diffusion limitation. The effects of total pressure on initial reaction rates indicated that the rate controlling steps of steam reforming are surface reactions between adsorbed species. The experimental results confirmed that both CO and CO 2 are primary products of steam reforming. Six detailed reaction mechanisms were considered by combining different adsorption behaviour of <b>methane</b> and <b>steam</b> on the nickel catalyst. For <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming,</b> accompanied by water gas shift on the catalyst used, intrinsic rate equations were derived by using the Langmuri-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LH-HW) approach and Freundlich's non-ideal adsorption concept. Applying the method of parameter estimation and model discrimination, the new model was determined and the parameters in this model were determined as statistically significant and thermodynamically consistent. The influence of hydrogen removed on the catalyst deactivated by hydrogen sulphide poisoning and carbon formation has been simulated for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> in a tubular catalytic reactor with a hydrogen permeable wall. The effects of the main variables on H 2 S tolerance and the tendency to carbon formation on the catalyst have been investigated. The simulation demonstrated that the hydrogen removed by the membrane may cause more extensive catalyst deactivation with the H 2 S tolerance decreasing and the tendency to carbon formation increasing as the proportion of hydrogen removal increased. The simulation also showed that the benefit of using a membrane reactor may not be achieved for feedstocks with a high H 2 S level when a high proportion of hydrogen is removed. A higher applied pressure and a more efficient desulphurisation technique need to be employed to compensate for the influence of significant hydrogen removal on the catalyst activity for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> in a membrane reactor operated at low temperatures...|$|R

The membranes obtained were microporous silica coated y/alumina and dense palladium coated oc- alumina membranes. The preparations of the membranes have been carried out by the dip coating technique and electroless plating method respectively. Characterization of the membranes obtained with single gas permeation measurements at high temperature and various pressures were accomplished. The performance of both membranes has been examined for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> on a commercial nickel/alumina catalyst (ICI 57 - 4). A simulation study on <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> for both conventional and membrane reactor has been completed to examine the performance of these membrane reactors. For the dip coating method, a microporous silica/y-alumina membrane was obtained and single gas permeations for hydrogen and nitrogen at high temperature have been measured. At 700 K the H 2 /N 2 selectivity was 4. 63. From the correlation between temperature and the permeation of nitrogen in the silica membrane it could be concluded that the permeation occurs in the transition region, which is controlled by both the Knudsen mechanism and some viscous flow. At a range of temperature between 623 - 743 K the pore diameter calculated by hydrogen permeation is 0. 57 nm. The effects of temperature on the permeation of the membrane and hydrothermal stability have been investigated. A hydrothermal exposure at around 723 K for more than 720 hours during <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> does not make any membrane transformation that leads to pore changes. A dense palladium coated a-alumina membrane was prepared by the electroless plating method. The single gas permeation for hydrogen and nitrogen at high 1 O temperature has been measured. At 700 K the HI and N 2 flux were 7. 96 cm /cm. min and 0. 05 cm 3 /cm 2. min respectively and the selectivity of H 2 /N 2 was 175. 03. The pressure dependence of the tfe flux for the Pd membrane was found to be to the power of 0. 5, which is the theoretical value. The Fb diffusion through the metal membrane is activated by temperature and can be described by an Arrhenius equation. The activation energy (Ea) is 17. 94 kJ/mol for the temperature range of 673 - 823 K. Both membranes were studied for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> by employing them as membrane reactors. The steam reforming focused on the improvement effects of the membrane on the conversion of methane. The effects of pressure, methane feed flow rate and ratio of steam/methane, as well as sweep gas on reactions have been investigated experimentally under conditions of no diffusion limitation. The influence of the membrane with a hydrogen permeable wall on the conversion of methane has also been simulated for <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> in a tubular catalytic reactor. The effects of the main variables as applied in the experiments of the <b>methane</b> <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> have been investigated in the simulation study either. The results of the simulation have been compared to the results of the experimental works. The general behavior is similar for both silica and palladium membrane reactors, i. e. : by selectively removing one of the products from the reaction mixture, the methane conversion can be improved to values higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium composition. From these results, it was concluded that in line with the permeation studies, the performance of the palladium composite membrane was far superior to that of the silica membrane for the <b>steam</b> <b>reforming</b> of <b>methane.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
