500|$|As {{with other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, the player is {{challenged}} to play through the lead or bass guitar portions of rock songs by matching colored notes that scroll on screen towards the player in time with physical actions to score points and keep the virtual crowd pleased. While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a [...] "Guitar Grip" [...] unit that <b>slips</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite {{to be used with}} the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the touch-sensitive screen of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.|$|E

2500|$|The Seattle Fault is {{the most}} studied of the {{regional}} faults, {{which has led to}} several models of its structure, which may also be relevant to other faults. In the wedge model of [...] a slab of rock [...] mainly basalts of the Crescent Formation [...] about 20km thick is being pushed up a [...] "master ramp" [...] of deeper material; this forms the Seattle Uplift. The Seattle fault zone is where the forward edge of the slab, coming {{to the top of the}} ramp, breaks and <b>slips</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seattle Basin. In this model the Tacoma fault zone is primarily the result of local adjustments as the slab bends upward at the bottom of the ramp.|$|E

She caught the attention of public with her dance number [...] "Beedi", which was highly popular in India and overseas. Critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, [...] "... Bipasha Basu is brought in to lend oomph and she succeeds in doing just that." [...] Basu became {{the talk of the town}} for donning a bikini in Aditya Chopra's Dhoom 2. She reportedly ate only oranges for three days and trained hard to shoot the scene. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, [...] "Aah Bipasha!

He lingers too long before he can go to Liza's room and hears the Countess' retinue coming, so he conceals himself as the old lady approaches. The Countess deplores the manners of the day and reminisces about the better times of her youth, when she sang in Versailles [...] "Je crains de lui parler la nuit" [...] (Laurette's Aria) from André Grétry's opera Richard Cœur-de-Lion before the Pompadour herself. As she dozes off, Herman stands before her. She awakens in horror as he pleads with her to tell him her secret. When she remains speechless, he grows desperate and threatens her with a pistol — at which she dies of fright. Liza rushes in, only to learn that the lover to whom she gave her heart was more interested in the Countess's secret. She orders him out and falls sobbing.|$|E

2500|$|Hoop {{earrings}} are circular or semi-circular in design, {{and look}} {{very similar to}} a ring. Hoop earrings generally {{come in the form}} of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of metal tubing, with a thin wire attachment penetrating the ear. [...] The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and <b>slips</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tube at the back. [...] The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. [...] Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud earrings. [...] A variation is the continuous hoop earring. [...] In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360°. [...] One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. [...] The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. [...] One special type of hoop earring is the sleeper earring, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. Hinged sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, sleepers are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced.|$|E

[...] The [...] "Imitation of Dante, the Translation of Pulci, the Danticles," [...] etc., were worked off, and, in prospecting for a new vein, a fresh lode of literary ore, he passed, by a natural transition, from Italian literature to Italian history, from the romantic and humorous epopee of Pulci and Berni, to the pseudo-classic drama of Alfieri and Monti.|$|E

60|$|The {{first thing}} {{you have to do is}} to catch your {{secretary}}. The genuine secretary is born, not made; and therefore you have got to catch him, not to appoint him. Appointing a secretary is pure vanity and vexation of spirit; you must find the right man made ready to your hand; and when you have found him you will soon see that he <b>slips</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> onerous duties of the secretariat as if to the manner born, by pure instinct. The perfect secretary is an urbane old gentleman of mature years and portly bearing, a dignified representative of British archæology, with plenty of money and plenty of leisure, possessing a heaven-born genius for organisation, and utterly unhampered by any foolish views of his own about archæological research or any other kindred subject. The secretary who archæologises is lost. His business is not to discourse of early English windows or of palæolithic hatchets, of buried villas or of Plantagenet pedigrees, of Roman tile-work or of dolichocephalic skulls, but to provide abundant brakes, drags, and carriages, to take care that the owners of castles and baronial residences throw them open (with lunch provided) to the ardent student of British antiquities, to see that all the old ladies have somebody to talk to, and all the young ones somebody to flirt with, and generally to superintend the morals, happiness, and personal comfort of some fifty assorted scientific enthusiasts. The secretary who diverges from these his proper and elevated functions into trivial and puerile disquisitions upon the antiquity of man (when he ought rather to be admiring the juvenility of woman), or the precise date of the Anglo-Saxon conquest (when he should by rights be concentrating the whole force of his massive intellect upon the arduous task of arranging for dinner), proves himself at once unworthy of his high position, and should forthwith be deposed from the secretariat by public acclamation.|$|E
