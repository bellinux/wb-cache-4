40|$|Objectives: Temporary {{abdominal}} closure methods {{allow for}} management of open abdomens where immediate primary closure {{is not possible}} and/or where repeat abdominal entries are necessary. We assessed pressure mapping and fluid extraction efficiency of three open abdomen dressing systems: ABThera™ Active Abdominal Therapy System, V. A. C. ® Abdominal <b>Dressing</b> <b>System,</b> and Barker’s vacuum packing technique. Methods: An in vitro test model was designed to simulate physical conditions present in an open abdomen. The model consisted of a rigid rest platform with elevated central region and a flexible outer layer with centrally located incision. Constant − 125 [*]mmHg negative pressure was applied according {{to the type of}} system, under simulated dynamic conditions, using albumin-based solution with a viscosity of 14 [*]cP. Data were collected by pressure sensors located circumferentially into three concentric zones: Zone 1 (closest to negative pressure source), Zone 2 (immediately outside of manifolding material edge), and Zone 3 (area most distal from negative pressure source). Each value was the result of approximately 100 pressure readings/zone/experiment with a total of three experiments for each system. Results: Pressure distribution of ABThera Therapy was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) superior to Barker’s vacuum packing technique in all three evaluated zones. Similarly, V. A. C. Abdominal <b>Dressing</b> <b>System</b> pressure distribution was significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) improved compared to Barker’s vacuum packing technique in all zones. There were no pressure distribution differences in Zone 1 between ABThera Therapy and V. A. C.

Abdominal <b>Dressing</b> <b>System.</b> Conclusions: These data suggest that all approaches to negative pressure therapy for open abdomen treatment are not equal.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Introduction 					Cell therapy using adipose-derived {{stem cells}} has been {{reported}} to improve chronic wounds via differentiation and paracrine effects. One such strategy is to deliver stem cells in hydrogels, which are studied increasingly as cell delivery vehicles for therapeutic healing and inducing tissue regeneration. This study aimed to determine the behaviour of encapsulated adipose-derived stem cells and identify the secretion profile of suitable growth factors for wound healing in a newly developed thermoresponsive PEG&# 8211;hyaluronic acid (HA) hybrid hydrogel to provide a novel living <b>dressing</b> <b>system.</b> 				 				 					 						Methods 					In this study, human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were encapsulated in situ in a water-soluble, thermoresponsive hyperbranched PEG-based copolymer (PEGMEMA&# 8211;MEO 2 MA&# 8211;PEGDA) with multiple acrylate functional groups in combination with thiolated HA, which was developed via deactivated enhanced atom transfer radical polymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 475), 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethyl methacrylate (MEO 2 MA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate PEGDA (Mn = 258). hADSCs embedded in the PEGMEMA&# 8211;MEO 2 MA&# 8211;PEGDA and HA hybrid hydrogel system (P-SH-HA) were monitored and analysed for their cell viability, cell proliferation and secretion of growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor beta and placental-derived growth factor) and cytokines (IFN&# 947;, IL- 2 and IL- 10) under three-dimensional culture conditions via the ATP activity assay, alamarBlue&# 174; assay, LIVE/DEAD&# 174; assay and multiplex ELISA, respectively. 				 				 					 						Results 					hADSCs were successfully encapsulated in situ with high cell viability for up to 7 days in hydrogels. Although cellular proliferation was inhibited, cellular secretion of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and placental-derived growth factor production increased over 7 days, whereas IL- 2 and IFN&# 947; release were unaffected. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					This study indicates that hADSCs can be maintained in a P-SH-HA hydrogel, and secrete pro-angiogenic growth factors with low cytotoxicity. With the potential to add more functionality for further structural modifications, this stem cell hydrogel system can be an ideal living <b>dressing</b> <b>system</b> for wound healing applications...|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetically induced {{transparency}} and absorption (EIT and EIA) are usually demonstrated by three-level atomic or atom-like systems. In {{contrast to the}} usual case, we theoretically study the EIT and EIA in an equivalent three-level system, which is constructed by dressing a superconducting two-level <b>system</b> (qubit) <b>dressed</b> by a single-mode cavity field. In this equivalent system, we find that both the EIT and the EIA can be tuned by controlling the level-spacing of the superconducting qubit and hence controlling the <b>dressed</b> <b>system.</b> This tunability {{is due to the}} dressed relaxation and dephasing rates which vary parametrically with the level-spacing of the original qubit and thus affect the transition properties of the dressed qubit and the susceptibility. These dressed relaxation and dephasing rates characterize the reaction of the dressed qubit to an incident probe field. We also use recent experimental data on superconducting qubits (charge, phase, and flux qubits) to demonstrate our approach and show the possibility of experimentally realizing this proposal.

40|$|In today's {{competitive}} fashion retailing business, providing "mix-and-match" or "fashion coordination" recommendations {{can enhance}} customer service, brand loyalty and improve sales. In this study, we propose a decision support tool for fashion coordination through {{the integration of}} the knowledge-based attribute evaluation expert system and the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network (TSFNN).

The evaluation of these attributes can be accomplished by a knowledge-based expert system which can handle the difficulty of processing linguistic and categorical information effectively. A fuzzy clustering technique and a new hybrid learning algorithm combining the PSO and GA techniques are proposed to reduce the coordination rules and the training time for the TSFNN. The experimental results show that rules reduction can shorten the TSFNN training time while keeping a very satisfactory and low MSE value. The proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms the Back Propagation, the Genetic Algorithm, and the Particle Swarm Optimization.

40|$|Terlig is a {{characteristic}} Mongolian dress. It was originally developed to accommodate aspects of Mongolian lifestyle and culture. During the Yuan dynasty, {{it came to}} symbolise the dress of higher social status. The original composition of the garment, i. e. the clothing material, created the initial form of the coat with a cutline at the waist that facilitated an equestrian lifestyle. A waistband and folds on the waistline were similarly added later. After attaining symbolic value, some of the terlig’s original functionality was lost, the waistband disappeared, and only the folds on the waist remained. The dual aspects of the terlig as a functional Mongolian coat and its symbolic aspect became part of high culture and were spread to the Khanates and neighbouring regions by the official <b>dress</b> <b>system.</b> Through this process, hybridity with Islamic and other local cultures occurred. Through secondary diffusion in the Mughal Empire, the terlig gained a new identity. During this later period its continued use in China and East Asia became fixed around an aspect of formality.

The physicochemical properties of PVA-SA membranes e. g. gel fraction and water uptake % have been performed. Increased SA content with PVA decreased gel fraction, elasticity, and elongation to break of PVA-SA membranes. However, it resulted in an increase in swelling degree, protein adsorption, and roughness of membrane surface. High SA content in PVA membranes had apparently an impact on surface morphology structure of hydrogel membranes. Pore size and pore area distribution have been observed with addition of high SA concentration. However, high SA content had an insignificant effect on the release of ampicillin. The hydrolytic degradation of PVA-SA membranes has prominently increased with increasing SA content.

RESULTS: There were 11 males with an average age of (59. 3 ± 3. 95) years. Nine had a perforated viscus, five had anastomotic leaks, three had iatrogenic bowel injury, and a further three had severe pelvic inflammatory disease. TNP and the VAC® Abdominal <b>Dressing</b> <b>System</b> were initially used. These were changed every two to three days. Abdominal closure was achieved in 15 / 20 patients within 4. 53 ± 1. 64 d.
