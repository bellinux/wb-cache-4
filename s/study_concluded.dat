5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the DPMA withdrew its {{opposition}} to the standard, citing the responsiveness of the committee to public concerns. In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that the proposed standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM were particularly well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{newspaper}} articles have heralded <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> that smoking bans lead to dramatic decreases {{in the annual}} incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coupled with <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> that bans never harm businesses and that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) significantly endangers health of nonsmokers, studies claiming AMI reduction have provided governments with additional evidence to support bans {{in the name of}} public health. Some communities have expanded bans from workplaces to include parks, beaches, and other open areas, based on this growing body of evidence. This commentary argues that, as with distorted claims regarding economic harm and ETS, recent <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> that bans lower AMI incidence misrepresent public health benefits of bans...|$|R

5|$|In 2011, DNA {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage {{was found to be}} the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>concluded,</b> based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E
5|$|Novomessor was synonymized in 1974, {{although}} {{evidence to}} retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster. However, N. ensifer {{does not have}} this glandular system. English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster. In 2015, a phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster, and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer, N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it.|$|E

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
5|$|Studies by English Heritage {{have found}} that the site {{originally}} functioned not only as the manorial court hall for Ruislip, but also as a working farm. The main building was built over two existing structures, possibly to accommodate the new lessee of the manor, Robert Drury, a former Speaker of the House of Commons. The <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> this was most likely achieved by a team of masons and carpenters. Manor Farm was also known as Ruislip Court until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} quality and funding source of <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> a {{negative}} economic impact of smoke-free policies in the hospitality industry to <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> no such negative impact. Data sources: Researchers sought all studies produced before 31 August 2002. Articles published in scientific journals were located with Medline, Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Current Contents, PsychInfo, Econlit, and Healthstar. Unpublished studies were located from tobacco company websites and through internet searches. Study selection: 97 studies that made statements about economic impact were included. 93 % of the studies located met the selection criteria as determined by consensus between multiple reviewers. Data extraction: Findings and characteristics of studies (apart from funding source) were classified independently by two researchers. A third assessor blind to both {{the objective of the}} present study and to funding source also classified each study. Data synthesis: In <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> a negative impact, the odds of using a subjective outcome measure was 4. 0 times (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 4 to 9. 6; p = 0. 007) and the odds of not being peer reviewed was 20 times (95 % CI 2. 6 to 166. 7; p = 0. 004) that of <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> no such negative impact. All of the <b>studies</b> <b>concluding</b> a negative impact were supported by the tobacco industry. 94 % of the tobacco industry supported <b>studies</b> <b>concluded</b> a negative economic impact compared to none of the non-industry supported studies. Conclusion: All of the best designed studies report no impact or a positive impact of smoke-free restaurant and bar laws on sales or employment. Policymakers can act to protect workers and patrons from the toxins in secondhand smoke confident in rejecting industry claims that there will be an adverse economic impact. <br /...|$|R

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP.

The <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E

5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It {{is one of the}} more basal genera, with only Amphicoelias and {{possibly}} a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was reclassified as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E

In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft errors in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.|$|E
