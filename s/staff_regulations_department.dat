40|$|This article investigates how {{a change}} in minimum nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>regulation</b> for California skilled nursing {{facilities}} (SNFs) affects nurse employment and how induced changes in nurse staffing affect patient mortality. In 2000, legislation increased the minimum nurse staffing standard and altered the calculation of nurse staffing, which created incentives to shift employment to lower skilled nurse labor. SNFs constrained by the new regulation increase absolute and relative hours worked by the lowest skilled type of nurse. Using this regulation change to instrument for measured nurse staffing levels, it is determined that increases in nurse staffing reduce on-site SNF patient mortality.

Weddel & CO BV had claimed an action for annulment of Regulation No 2806/87, which restricted the amount of beef it could import, and asked a Commission official give evidence that he had assured a Dutch authority that no ceiling would be imposed. The Commission denied the official authority to give evidence, alleging it could do this under the <b>Staff</b> <b>Regulations,</b> articles 17 to 19, on the ground that the same facts were pending in another case, Weddel v Commission. The Commission argued that the <b>Staff</b> <b>Regulations</b> article 17 prohibited officials disclosing confidential information obtained from third parties or disclosing to unauthorised persons any document or information not already made public.|$|R
