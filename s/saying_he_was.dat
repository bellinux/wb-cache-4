5|$|He {{has earned}} 51 caps for Egypt and scored 20 goals. Mido scored on his {{international}} debut against the United Arab Emirates, which Egypt won 2–1. Mido sent a fax to the Egypt team {{to tell them}} he was not available for international selection in May 2004, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not psychologically fit to join the team. Mido {{was a part of}} the Egypt squad that played at the 2004 African Cup of Nations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his father}} <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> betrayed {{by his friend}} C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted by the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult. After {{a year in}} the role, Engen {{announced}} his exit from The Young and the Restless because of objections over his storyline, and Michael Muhney was recast in the role. Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney was fired from the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not informed of it and believed {{it was the wrong}} thing to do. He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and would continue to be offered.|$|E

50|$|His birthplace is unclear, as {{some sources}} <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Buenos Aires in July 1793, but others, {{such as the}} {{historian}} Carlos Calvo, <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Santiago de Chile.

5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in his lower abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off the ice. In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form. Carroll {{said it would be}} a long recovery.|$|E
5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was in. In {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. Even that, however, failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.|$|E
5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too busy writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon {{to work on that}} film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not mean}} that all mad {{delusions}} are as concrete as this, though some are more concrete. Believing your own body is glass is a more daring denial of reality than believing a tree is a glass lamp {{at the top of}} a pole. But all true delusions have in them this unalterable assertion--that what is not is. The difference between us and the maniac is not about how things look or how things ought to look, but about what they self-evidently are. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> ought to <b>be</b> King; Perkin Warbeck might <b>say</b> that. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> King. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> as wise as Shakespeare; Bernard Shaw might say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Shakespeare. The lunatic does not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> divine in the same sense as Christ; Mr. R.J. Campbell would say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Christ. In all cases the difference is a difference about what is there; not a difference touching what should be done about it.|$|R
5|$|As of 2008, Del Piero has captained Italy {{seven times}} (including during UEFA Euro 2008). He also {{initially}} regularly wore the number 10 shirt, in particular under Maldini and Zoff, but later {{gave it to}} Totti after Euro 2000, and switched to No. 7 for the 2002 World Cup, {{as it was the}} first number he wore at the start of his career. Even though the number 10 shirt was vacated after Totti retired from the national team in July 2007, Del Piero denied any interest in taking back the number, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> satisfied with No. 7. In May, he was recalled by popular demand to Italy's UEFA Euro 2008 squad in Austria and Switzerland under manager Roberto Donadoni, after a nine-month absence from international duty, and thus became the second Italian player, after Paolo Maldini, to participate in seven major international tournaments (Euro 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008; World Cup 1998, 2002, 2006).|$|E
5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The choice {{was seen as a}} surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ready to be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in {{connection}} with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet Herybert Menzel. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
