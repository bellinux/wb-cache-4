The {{concept of}} central super-massive stars (M ≥ 5 × 10 4 M⊙, where M is {{the mass of}} the <b>super-massive</b> <b>star)</b> {{embedded}} in dense stellar systems was suggested as a possible explanation for high- energy emissions phenomena occurring in active galactic nuclei and quasars (Vilkoviski 1976, Hara 1978), such as X-ray emissions (Bahcall and Ostriker, 1975). SMSs and super-massive black holes are two possibilities to explain the nature of super-massive central objects, and supermassive stars may be an intermediate step towards the formation of super-massive black holes (Rees 1984). Therefore it is important to study such a dense gas-star system in detail. We address here the implementation of radiative transfer in a model which was presented in former work (Amaro-Seoane and Spurzem 2001, Amaro-Seoane et al. 2002).

Since {{the outcome of the}} final collapse -A super-massive black hole or hypernova- depends sensitively on the structure {{and the size of the}} object, when the instability sets in, it is important to investigate in more detail the contraction phase of the SMS. If the gaseous object is embedded in a dense stellar system, the central star cluster, the interaction and coupling of both components due to dynamical friction changes the energy balance and evolution of the SMS dramatically. Dynamical friction between stars and gas, which can be estimated semi-analytically (see Just et al. 1986), has three different effects on the two-component system.

These objects have spectra typical of old stellar systems, but are unresolved on photographic sky survey plates.

These objects are all within 30 arcminutes of the central galaxy of the cluster, NGC 1399, but are distributed over larger radii than the globular cluster system of that galaxy.

30|$|If H 2 cooling {{is indeed}} {{suppressed}} until the halo reaches a virial temperature of ≃ 10 ^ 4 K, the gas contracts nearly isothermally and becomes gravitationally unstable at a Jeans mass of ≃ 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 M_. The angular {{momentum of the}} contracting cloud is redistributed by turbulence and bar-like instabilities, such that the collapse proceeds nearly unhindered until the cloud becomes optically thick to continuum emission and a protostar forms (Oh and Haiman 2002; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Begelman et al. 2006; Lodato and Natarajan 2006; Wise et al. 2008; Begelman and Shlosman 2009; Choi et al. 2013; Latif et al. 2013 b; Prieto et al. 2013). Due to the high temperature of the gas, the time-averaged accretion rate onto the protostar is of order 1 M_ yr^- 1, eventually resulting {{in the formation of}} a <b>super-massive</b> <b>star.</b> Once enough mass has been accreted, a general relativistic instability develops and a fraction of the star collapses into a BH (see Section  5.7). As opposed to minihalos, photoheating is not able to significantly suppress accretion, since the virial temperature of the halo is of order the temperature to which the gas is heated, and momentum transfer by photons only mildly reduces the collapse rate (Johnson et al. 2011, 2012).|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{predicted}} that the first stars and galaxies have distinct observational signatures. One of the most promising signatures stems from Population III SNe (e.g. de Souza et al. 2014). The resulting lightcurves may show the characteristics of core-collapse SNe (Meiksin and Whalen 2013; Whalen et al. 2013 b, 2013 g), pair-instability SNe (Scannapieco et al. 2005; Weinmann and Lilly 2005; Hummel et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2013 b; Whalen et al. 2013 a, 2013 f, 2014), gamma-ray bursts (Bromm and Loeb 2002, 2006; Choudhury and Srianand 2002; Islam et al. 2004; Natarajan et al. 2005; Hirose et al. 2006; Belczynski et al. 2007; Inoue et al. 2007; Naoz and Barkana 2007; Salvaterra et al. 2007, 2008; Salvaterra and Chincarini 2007; Komissarov and Barkov 2010; Mészáros and Rees 2010; Campisi et al. 2011; de Souza et al. 2011, 2012; Toma et al. 2011; Nakauchi et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Macpherson et al. 2013; Elliott et al. 2014; Maio and Barkov 2014; Mesler et al. 2014), or even <b>super-massive</b> <b>stars</b> (Whalen et al. 2013 c, 2013 d, 2013 h). More exotic signatures include the neutrino emission accompanying a SN explosion (Fryer et al. 2001; Iocco et al. 2005, 2008 b; Nakazato et al. 2006; Suwa et al. 2009), and gravitational waves from BH binaries (Fryer et al. 2001; Belczynski et al. 2004; Kulczycki et al. 2006; Suwa et al. 2007 a; Kinugawa et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} and thermal {{evolution of the}} gas in the SN remnant {{is similar to that}} in relic H[*]ii regions. The elevated electron abundance facilitates the formation of H 2 and HD, which may trigger secondary Population III star formation once the gas recollapses. For highly energetic explosions, the time required for the gas to recollapse is of the order of the Hubble time (Greif et al. 2010), while for less energetic explosions the collapse time is ≃ 10 Myr (Ritter et al. 2012). Idealized simulations have also found that fragmentation in the dense shell swept up by the SN remnant may occur (Salvaterra et al. 2004; Machida et al. 2005; Vasiliev et al. 2008; Nagakura et al. 2009; Chiaki et al. 2013 b). The influence of the remnant on neighboring halos depends primarily on the distance of the halo from the progenitor star and their density (Greif et al. 2007; Sakuma and Susa 2009; Whalen et al. 2010). If they are close enough and have not yet collapsed, star formation will be delayed or suppressed, while in rare cases the shock wave may compress the halo and trigger collapse. Recent studies also investigated the explosion of <b>super-massive</b> <b>stars</b> with up to 105 M⊙ in atomic cooling halos that remained metal-free (Johnson et al. 2013 b; Whalen et al. 2013 c, 2013 d).

With a kinetic energy of up to 1055 ergs, these SNe were able to completely disrupt their host halos.|$|R

The necessary condition for being Petrov type D is given for general perfect fluid matter. As a special case, fluids with a linear equation of state are considered. Using a power series expansion at the regular center, it is shown that the Petrov D condition is inconsistent with the linear equation of state assumption. 1 Slowly rotating fluid balls Rotating perfect fluid exact solutions of the Einstein equations would give great insights into the structure of astrophysical objects such as neutron <b>stars</b> and <b>super-massive</b> <b>stars.</b> Because {{of the complexity of}} the problem the usual method in trying to find such spacetimes is to make some a priory assumption, i. e. use an ansatz, and hope that solutions with that property will exist.

The technique we propose in order to achieve this goal is to check whether the ansatz can remain valid in the slow rotation limit.

40|$|We {{consider}} a scenario where supermassive black holes form through direct {{accumulation of gas}} at the centre of proto-galaxies. In the first stage, the accumulated gas forms a <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> whose core collapses when the nuclear fuel is exhausted, forming a black hole of M_ BH≈ 100 M_. As the black hole starts accreting, it inflates the surrounding dense gas into an almost hydrostatic self-gravitating envelope, with at least 10 - 100 times {{the mass of the}} hole. We find that these "quasistars" suffer extremely high rates of mass loss through winds from their envelopes, in analogy to very massive stars such as eta-Carinae. Only for envelope masses greater than 2. 8 × 10 ^ 5 (M_ BH/ 100 M_) ^ 9 / 11 is the envelope evaporation time-scale longer than the accretion time-scale of the black hole. This relation thus constitutes a "threshold growth line" above which quasistars can grow their internal black holes. Accretion rates can be 10 to 100 times the Eddington rate. The quasistars born in this "growth region" with 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 8 M_ can grow black holes with masses between 10 ^ 4 to 10 ^ 5 M_, before crossing the threshold growth line and dispersing their envelopes in less than 10 ^ 4 yr. This scenario therefore predicts that massive black hole seeds can be found only in dark matter halos with total masses larger than about 10 ^ 9 M_, which can provide sufficiently high accretion rates to form such massive quasistars.

Here, I investigate the effect that a magnetar (initial rotational energy of 4 x 10 ^ 50 erg and field strength of 7 x 10 ^ 13 G) {{would have on the}} properties of a typical Type II SN ejecta (mass of 13. 35 Msun, kinetic energy of 1. 32 x 10 ^ 51 erg, 0. 077 Msun of 56 Ni) produced by the terminal explosion of an H-rich blue-supergiant star. I present a non-LTE time-dependent radiative transfer simulation of the resulting photometric and spectroscopic evolution from 1 d until 600 d after explosion. With magnetar power, the model luminosity and brightness are enhanced, the ejecta is everywhere hotter and more ionised, and the spectrum formation region is much more extended. This magnetar-powered SN ejecta reproduces most of the observed properties of SLSN iPTF 14 hls, including the sustained brightness of - 18 mag in the R band, the blue optical color, and the broad HI lines for 600 d. The non-extreme magnetar properties, combined with the standard Type II SN ejecta properties offer an interesting alternative to the pair-unstable <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> model recently proposed, which involves a highly-energetic and super-massive ejecta. Hence, such Type II SLSNe may differ from standard Type II SNe exclusively through the influence of a magnetar. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A Letter...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamical {{simulations of}} the wind-wind collision between the enigmatic <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> and its mysterious companion star are presented which include radiative driving of the stellar winds, gravity, optically-thin radiative cooling, and orbital motion. Simulations with static stars with a periastron passage separation {{reveal that the}} preshock companion star's wind speed is sufficiently reduced that radiative cooling in the postshock gas becomes important, permitting the runaway growth of non-linear thin shell (NTSI) instabilities which massively distort the WCR. However, large-scale simulations which include the orbital motion of the stars, show that orbital motion reduces the impact of radiative inhibition, and thus increases the acquired preshock velocities. As such, the postshock gas temperature and cooling time see a commensurate increase, and sufficient gas pressure is preserved to stabilize the WCR against catastrophic instability growth. We then compute synthetic X-ray spectra and lightcurves and find that, compared to previous models, the X-ray spectra agree much better with XMM-Newton observations just prior to periastron. The narrow width of the 2009 X-ray minimum can also be reproduced. However, the models fail to reproduce the extended X-ray mimimum from previous cycles. We conclude {{that the key to}} explaining the extended X-ray minimum is the rate of cooling of the companion star's postshock wind. If cooling is rapid then powerful NTSIs will heavily disrupt the WCR. Radiative inhibition of the companion star's preshock wind, albeit with a stronger radiation-wind coupling than explored in this work, could be an effective trigger.

40|$|In the 60 s and 70 s super-massive central objects (from now onwards SMOs) {{were thought}} to be the main source of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) {{characteristics}} (luminosities of L ≈ 10 ^ 12 L_). The release of gravitational binding energy by the accretion of material on to an SMO in the range of 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 9 M_ has been suggested to be the primary powerhouse (Lynden-Bell 1969). That rather exotic idea in early time has become common sense nowadays. Not only our own galaxy harbours a few million-solar mass black hole (Genzel 2001) but also many of other non-active galaxies show kinematic and gas-dynamic evidence of these objects (Magorrian et al. 1998) The concept of central <b>super-massive</b> <b>stars</b> (SMSs henceforth) (M> 5 × 10 ^ 4 M_, where M is the mass of the SMS) embedded in dense stellar systems was suggested as a possible explanation for high- energy emissions phenomena occurring in AGNs and quasars (Vilkoviski 1976, Hara 1978), such as X-ray emissions (Bahcall and Ostriker, 1975).

30|$|The {{evolution}} of the central cloud beyond the initial collapse of the gas was investigated {{in a number of}} studies. Regan and Haehnelt (2009) used adaptive mesh refinement simulations with a maximum resolution of ≃ 0.01 pc, 16 cells per Jeans length, and employed a pressure floor to avoid artificial fragmentation. Due to the limited resolution, the collapse stalled at a density of n_H≃ 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3, followed by the formation of a massive disk around the central hydrostatic core. In one of the three halos investigated, the cloud fragmented into three distinct clumps. Latif et al. (2013 e) employed sink particles above a density of n_H≃ 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3 and found that some of the clouds were prone to fragmentation. In a follow-up study, Latif et al. (2013 a) investigated nine different halos using 64 cells per Jeans length, and employed a pressure floor at a similar density as Regan and Haehnelt (2009). They found that even though fragmentation occurs, the central object continues to grow via turbulent accretion and mergers at a rate of ≃ 1 M_ yr^- 1. At this rate, a <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> with ≃ 10 ^ 6 M_ would form after only ≃ 1 Myr (see also Inayoshi and Haiman 2014). Similar fragmentation and accretion was found in the high-resolution simulations of Regan et al. (2014 a). In a complementary approach, Inayoshi et al. (2014) included the most comprehensive chemical and thermal model to date. Although they do not start from cosmological initial conditions and terminate the simulation once the density reaches n_H≃ 10 ^ 17 cm^- 3, they find a minimum Jeans mass of ≃ 0.2 M_, which is more than an order of magnitude higher than in other star formation environments.|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> Eta Carinae is simulated using a three dimensional {{model of the}} wind-wind collision. In the model the intrinsic X-ray emission is spatially extended and energy dependent. Absorption due to the unshocked stellar winds and the cooled postshock material from the primary LBV star is calculated as the intrinsic emission is ray-traced along multiple sightlines through the 3 D spiral structure of the circumstellar environment. The observable emission is then compared to available X-ray data, including the lightcurve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and spectra observed by XMM-Newton. The orientation and eccentricity of the orbit are explored, as are the wind parameters of {{the stars and the}} nature and physics of their close approach. Our modelling supports a viewing angle with an inclination of ~ 42 degrees, consistent with the polar axis of the Homunculus nebula (Smith 2006), and the projection of the observer's line-of-sight onto the orbital plane has an angle of ~ 0 - 30 degrees in the prograde direction on the apastron side of the semi-major axis. However, there are significant discrepancies between the observed and model lightcurves and spectra through the X-ray minimum. In particular, the hard flux in our synthetic spectra is an order of magnitude greater than observed. Further calculations reveal that radiative inhibition significantly reduces the preshock velocity of the companion wind. As a consequence the hard X-ray emission is quenched, but it is unclear whether the long duration of the minimum is due solely to this mechanism alone. Models incorporating a collapse/disruption of the WCR and/or reduced preshock companion wind velocities bring the predicted emission and the observations into much better agreement (abridged).

Using {{a variety of techniques}} we found that G 30 is very young cluster, with age t~ 4 Myr. The cluster is located in Carina spiral arm, it is deeply embedded in dust and suffers reddening of Av~ 10. 5 +- 1. 1 mag. The distance to the object is d= 7. 2 +- 0. 9 kpc. The mass of the cluster members down to 2. 35 Msol is ~ 1600 Msol. Cluster's MF for the mass range of 5. 6 to 31. 6 Msol shows a slope of Gamma=- 1. 01 +- 0. 03. The total mass of the cluster obtained by this MF down to 1 Msol is about 3 x 10 ^ 3 Msol. The spectral analysis and the models allow us to conclude that in G 30 are at least one Ofpe/WN and two WR stars. The WR stars are of WN 6 - 7 hydrogen rich type with progenitor masses more than 60 Msol. G 30 is a new member of the exquisite family of young Galactic clusters, hosting WR stars. It is a factor of two to three less massive than some of the youngest <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> clusters like Arches, Quintuplet and Central cluster and is their smaller analog.

40|$|Eta Carinae is a <b>super-massive,</b> super-luminous <b>star.</b> It is {{surrounded}} by a bipolar nebula, the "Homunculus", and several blobs of ejected gas which are the source of a complex emission-line spectrum. This thesis presents results from spectroscopic investigations of the star and its surroundings, performed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The age of the equatorial disk in the Homunculus has been studied by measurements of radial velocities of emission lines. Fluorescence processes in Fe II, Fe III, and Cr II are discussed, and the discovery of an ejected filament producing Sr II and [Sr II] emission is reported. Also, a list of 2000 emission line identifications is presented and discussed. The chemically peculiar star Chi Lupi was the target of the "Pathfinder Project", a mapping of the UV spectrum of the star using the GHRS. An investigation of the abundance and isotopic composition of boron in Chi Lupi is presented. The launch of space telescopes has put greater demands on the quality of atomic data needed for the analyses of the observed spectra.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of star formation in starburst galaxies undergoing interactions, connections among the red quasars, the BL Lacs, and the Blazars with the gamma-ray bursts {{are discussed in the}} light of the "hypernovae" scenario. It is proposed that the gamma-ray bursts occur primarily in the star formation regions in starburst environments, and arise from the core-collapse of <b>super-massive</b> Wolf-Rayet <b>stars,</b> that are formed in interacting systems. In this interacting environment star formations cause supernovae explosions. As the stars explode, shock waves propagate outward and collide with the ambient medium, forming a high-density super-shell, where intense star formation begins; subsequently supernovae explosions within the shell cause an outward expansion of the shell. In another scenario of star formation the interactions among the large gas-rich low-surface brightness (LSB) spiral galaxies give rise to fragmentation of their tidal tails. These fragmented clouds collapse to compact dwarfs, which undergo rapid star formation. In such a scenario of interactions, where most quasars are observed, we discuss the MgII absorption lines in GRB 970508, whose spectra resemble a BL Lac object, and the spectral evolution of GRB 971214 that may also indicate a similar connection. Beside the BL Lac connection, the recent discovery of GRB 980425 in a nearby galaxy indicates asymmetric supernovae explosions that give rise to relativistic jets. We propose that the gamma-ray light curves arise due to inverse Compton scattering of soft-photons from precessing relativistic blobs of plasma moving in jets. This brings into light the mechanisms of supernova explosions, that give birth to relativistic jets. Comment: 38 page...|$|R
40|$|New {{integral}} field spectroscopy {{has been}} obtained for IZw 18, the nearby lowest-metallicity galaxy considered our best local analog of systems forming at high-z. Here we report the spatially resolved spectral {{map of the}} nebular HeII 4686 emission in IZw 18, from which we derived {{for the first time}} its total HeII-ionizing flux. Nebular HeII emission implies the existence of a hard radiation field. HeII-emitters are observed to be more frequent among high-z galaxies than for local objects. So investigating the HeII-ionizing source(s) in IZw 18 may reveal the ionization processes at high-z. HeII emission in star-forming galaxies, has been suggested to be mainly associated with Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), but WRs cannot satisfactorily explain the HeII-ionization at all times, in particular at lowest metallicities. Shocks from supernova remnants, or X-ray binaries, have been proposed as additional potential sources of HeII-ionizing photons. Our data indicate that conventional HeII-ionizing sources (WRs, shocks, X-ray binaries) are not sufficient to explain the observed nebular HeII 4686 emission in IZw 18. We find that the HeII-ionizing radiation expected from models for either low-metallicity <b>super-massive</b> O <b>stars</b> or rotating metal-free stars could account for the HeII-ionization budget measured, while only the latter models could explain the highest values of HeII 4686 /Hbeta observed. The presence of such peculiar stars in IZw 18 is suggestive and further investigation in this regard is needed. This letter highlights that some of the clues of the early Universe can be found here in our cosmic backyard. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|Context. Young massive {{clusters}} {{are usually}} {{deeply embedded in}} dust and gas. They represent excellent astrophysical laboratories {{for the study of}} massive stars. Clusters with Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are of special importance, since this enables us to study a coeval WR population at a uniform metallicity and known age. Aims. We started a long- term project to search the inner Milky Way for hidden star clusters and to study them in detail. GLIMPSE 30 (G 30) is one of these clusters. It is situated near the Galactic plane (l = 298 degrees 756, b = - 0 degrees. 408) and we determine its physical parameters and investigate its high-mass stellar content especially WR stars. Methods. Our analysis is based on SOFI/NTT J(S) HK(S) imaging and low resolution (R similar to 2000) spectroscopy of the brightest cluster members in the K atmospheric window. For the age determination we applied isochrone fits for MS and Pre- MS stars. We derived stellar parameters of the WR stars candidates using a full nonLTE modeling of the observed spectra. Results. Using a variety of techniques we found that G 30 is very young cluster, with age t approximate to 4 Myr. The cluster is located in the Carina spiral arm, it is deeply embedded in dust and su. ers reddening of A(v) similar to 10. 5 +/- 1. 1 mag. The distance to the object is d = 7. 2 +/- 0. 9 kpc. The mass of the cluster members down to 2. 35 M(circle dot) is similar to 1600 M(circle dot). The cluster's MF for the mass range of 5. 6 to 31. 6 M(circle dot) shows a slope of G = - 1. 01 +/- 0. 03. The total mass of the cluster obtained by this MF down to 1 M(circle dot) is about 3 x 103 M-circle dot. The spectral analysis and the models allow us to conclude that at least one Ofpe/WN and two WR stars can be found in G 30. The WR stars are of the WN 6 - 7 hydrogen rich type with progenitor masses of more than 60 M(circle dot). Conclusions. G 30 is a new member of the family of young Galactic clusters hosting WR stars. It is a factor of two to three less massive than some of the youngest <b>super-massive</b> <b>star</b> clusters like Arches, Quintuplet and the Central cluster and is their smaller analog...|$|E
40|$|We present VULCAN/ 2 D multi-group flux-limited-diffusion {{radiation}} hydrodynamics {{simulations of}} binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, using the Shen equation of state, covering 100 ms, and starting from azimuthal-averaged 2 D slices obtained from 3 D SPH simulations of Rosswog & Price for 1. 4 Msun (baryonic) neutron stars with no initial spins, co-rotating spins, and counter-rotating spins. Snapshots are post-processed at 10 ms intervals with a multi-angle neutrino-transport solver. We find polar-enhanced neutrino luminosities, dominated by ν̅_e and "ν_μ" neutrinos at peak, although ν_e emission may be stronger at late times. We obtain typical peak neutrino energies for ν_e, ν̅_e, and "ν_μ" of 12, 16, and 22 MeV. The <b>super-massive</b> neutron <b>star</b> (SMNS) formed from the merger has a cooling timescale of 1 s. Charge-current neutrino reactions {{lead to the}} formation of a thermally-driven bipolar wind with 10 ^- 3 Msun/s, baryon-loading the polar regions, and preventing any production of a GRB prior to black-hole formation. The large budget of rotational free energy suggests magneto-rotational effects could produce a much greater polar mass loss. We estimate that 10 ^- 4 Msun of material with electron fraction in the range 0. 1 - 0. 2 become unbound during this SMNS phase as a result of neutrino heating. We present a new formalism to compute the ν_iν̅_i annihilation rate based on moments of the neutrino specific intensity computed with our multi-angle solver. Cumulative annihilation rates, which decay as t^- 1. 8, decrease over our 100 ms window from a few 10 ^ 50 to 10 ^ 49 erg/s, equivalent to a few 10 ^ 54 to 10 ^ 53 e^-e^+ pairs per second.

5000|$|Current {{theoretical}} stellar models {{show that}} most high-mass Population III stars quickly exhausted their fuel and exploded in extremely energetic pair-instability supernovae. Those explosions would have thoroughly dispersed their material, ejecting metals into the interstellar medium (ISM), to {{be incorporated into the}} later generations of stars. Their destruction suggests that no galactic high-mass Population III stars should be observable. However, some Population III stars might be seen in high-redshift galaxies whose light originated during the earlier history of the universe. None have been discovered. Stars too massive to produce pair-instability supernovae would have collapsed into black holes through a process known as photodisintegration, but some matter may have escaped during this process in the form of relativistic jets, and this could have [...] "sprayed" [...] the first metals into the universe. [...] It has been proposed that recent supernovae SN 2006gy and SN 2007bi may have been pair-instability supernovae in which such <b>super-massive</b> Population III <b>stars</b> exploded. It has been speculated that these stars could have formed relatively recently in dwarf galaxies containing primordial metal-free interstellar matter; past supernovae in these galaxies could have ejected their metal-rich contents at speeds high enough for them to escape the galaxy, keeping the metal content of the galaxy very low.|$|R
40|$|Simulations show {{eccentric}} disks (m = 1 modes) forming around quasi-Keplerian potentials, a {{topic of}} interest for fueling quasars, forming super-massive BHs, planet formation and mi-gration, explaining the origin and properties of nuclear eccentric stellar disks like that in M 31, and driving {{the formation of the}} obscuring AGN torus. We consider the global, linear normal m = 1 modes in collisionless disks, without the restriction that the disk mass be negligible relative to the central (Keplerian) mass. We derive their structure and key resonance features, and show how they arise, propagate inwards, and drive both inflow/outflow and eccentricities in the disk. We compare with hydrodynamic simulations of such disks around a <b>super-massive</b> BH, with <b>star</b> formation, gas cooling, and feedback. We derive the dependence of the normal mode structure on disk structure, mass profiles, and thickness, and mode pattern speeds and growth rates. We show that, if the disk at some radii has mass of & 10 % the central point mass, the modes are linearly unstable and are self-generating. They arise as “fast modes ” with pattern speed of order the local angular velocity at these radii. The characteristic global nor-mal modes have pattern speeds comparable to the linear growth rate, of order (GM 0 R− 30) 1 / 2, where M 0 is the central mass and R 0 is the radius where the enclosed disk mass ∼M 0. They propagate inwards by exciting eccentricities towards smaller and smaller radii, until at small radii these are “slow modes. ” With moderate amplitude, the global normal modes can lead to shocks and significant gas inflows at near-Eddington rates at all radii inside several ∼ R 0...|$|R
