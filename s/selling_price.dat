40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{land prices}} in the Savinja statistical region. The analysis is performed {{on the basis of}} data including advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of wooded areas as well as agricultural and building land. All <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> also comprise a general market value determined by means of the real estate mass appraisal conducted by the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia (GURS). In the beginning, the treated region is analysed as a whole. To perform a detailed analysis of the relevant land prices and general market values, an analysis {{at the level of the}} local communities is also included. The analysis of the discrepancy between advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> shows that advertised prices are in all cases higher than the selling ones. However, the analysis of the discrepancy between <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and general market values reveals that general market values are lower than relevant <b>selling</b> <b>prices.</b> On the basis of the results, it was established that there exist the biggest discrepancy between advertised <b>prices,</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and general market values in the sphere of building land, and the smallest in the one of wooded areas. In general, it can be concluded for all three land development degrees that the highest prices are the advertised ones, followed by <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and general market values...|$|R

5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|The land {{within the}} town {{is made up of}} {{approximately}} 62% greenspace, 18% domestic gardens, 7% roads, 4% domestic buildings, 3% non-domestic buildings and 6% other uses. Since the 19th century, trade in Brownhills has been centred on the High Street. As the canal and Clayhanger Common lie immediately to the south of the High Street, the town's housing areas are mainly to the north and at the eastern and western ends of the town. Brownhills has 5,152 residential dwellings, of which 47% are semi-detached houses. Selling prices for all types of property within the town have risen significantly since 2000; in August 2007 the average <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> was £137,600, compared to £59,596 in 2000, a rise of 131%. The Aldridge and Brownhills Housing Trust owns and manages those properties formerly owned as council houses by Walsall Council.|$|E
5|$|The offer, {{representing}} a 46 percent premium over the stocks <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> at the time, {{came as a}} surprise to Burger King CEO John Chidsey. The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners to brighten its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E

5|$|The brief {{peace in}} Europe allowed Napoleon {{to focus on}} the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of {{political}} autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the land market in the Pomurska statistical region. The basic concepts of the real estate market are presented, as well as the factors which affect the value of real estate. Data on advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of land properties in the Pomurska statistical region was collected. Based on the collected data, a statistical analysis was made for land prices in several developmental stages, as well as a comparison between advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of land properties across the region and local communities. Due to lack of data on land prices, the market value of land at various development stages in the municipality of Moravske Toplice was assessed using the land development method. The results of the analysis have shown that {{there is a big difference}} between the advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices,</b> which is the consequence of various factors, mainly depends on the location of the land and the balance between supply and demand on the real estate market.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} specific emotions on the endowment effect, the tendency for <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> to exceed buying or “choice ” prices for the same object. As predicted by appraisal-tendency theory, disgust induced by a prior, irrelevant situation carried over to normatively unrelated economic decisions, reducing <b>selling</b> and choice <b>prices</b> and eliminating the endowment effect. Sadness also carried over, reducing <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> but increasing choice prices [...] producing a “reverse endowment effect ” in which choice <b>prices</b> exceeded <b>selling</b> <b>prices.</b> The results demonstrate that incidental emotions can influence decisions even when real money is at stake, and that emotions of the same valence can have opposing effects on such decisions. Two decades of research document the tendency for incidental emotion to color normatively unrelated judgments and decisions (for reviews, see Forgas, 1995; Loewenstein & Lerner, 2002; Schwarz, 1990). Early research found that positive emotions trigger more optimistic assessments than negative emotions, whereas negative emotions trigger more pessimistic assessments than positive emotions, even if {{the source of the}} emotion has no relation to the target judgments (Johnson & Tversky, 1983).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical trend model (HTM) for <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of houses, addressing three main problems: the {{spatial and temporal}} dependence of <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and the dependency of price index changes on housing quality. In this model the general price trend, cluster-level price trends, and specific characteristics play a role. Every cluster, a combination of district and house type, has its own price development. The HTM is used for property valuation and for determining local price indices. Two applications are provided, one for the Breda region, {{and one for the}} Amsterdam region, lying respectively south and north in The Netherlands. For houses in these regions the accuracy of the valuation results are presented together with the price index results. Price indices based on the HTM are compared to a standard hedonic index and an index based on weighted median <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> published by national brokerage organization. It is shown that, especially for small housing market segments the HTM produces price indices which are more accurate, detailed, and up-to-date...|$|R
