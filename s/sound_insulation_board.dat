40|$|The {{case study}} {{presents}} the results of laboratory measurements carried out for the determination of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> properties for various modern partition glass walls systems. The analyzed partition glass walls were made with structures of aluminum profiles and with sheets of glazed materials. Laboratory measurements for determining the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of walls were performed in the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> stand of Building Acoustics Laboratory of NRDI URBAN INCERC, INCERC Bucharest Branch, in accordance with EN ISO 10140 - 2 "Acoustics.

40|$|In North America, both single-unit and {{multiple}} housing is frequently built using wood stud construction. The overall <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of many common wood stud walls {{is limited by}} excess low frequency sound transmission and indoor aircraft noise levels are dominated by low frequency sound. A study to develop improved methods for determining the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of buildings against aircraft noise has included laboratory <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> measurements of 41 wood stud wall constructions. The results highlight the importance of low frequency resonanaces on the overall <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> ratings.

We have obtained and calculated <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> data for common structural elements (wall and floor) {{that are used in}} construction (brick walls, plasterboard walls, concrete wall and floor constructions …). <b>Sound</b> <b>insulation</b> data for the element is the base for calculation of <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms, because in addition to the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of border element, the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms is also influenced by other parameters (size of rooms, contacts between the elements of rooms …). The calculation only takes into account propagation of the sound trough construction and not the direct passage of sound and indirect sound transmission through the second room. It also includes brief presentation of three Slovenian and one foregion computer programs used for calculating the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms that are in accordance with current legislation and available on the Slovenian market.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{building}} acoustics is the prediction of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms to determine the quality of sound protection. In many practical cases, however, the objective measures of the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> using procedures in standards are not {{in agreement with the}} subjective assessment. This paper, therefore, after reviewing the conventional model to calculate airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation,</b> introduces a calculation scheme based on loudness level linked with specific fluctuation strength, yielding a weighted normalised loudness level difference, Lnor,w. By analysing the difference between standard airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> values and the introduced weighted normalised loudness level difference, it is revealed that the sound pressure level that is transmitted through a partition decreases with increasing frequency, and this is independent of the type of signal and of the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> values (View the MathML source-values), whereas if the transmitted signal is converted into a loudness level, it tends to rise with increasing frequency. Moreover, it is found that, whereas a simple level difference does not exhibit the effect of a given signal to the frequency-dependent airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> curve, using Lnor,w, a significant change can be observed, in terms of both computed and measured results. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent results allow more details to be investigated for a certain <b>sound</b> <b>insulation.</b> A comparison between the measured and predicted airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> with no obvious malfunction suggests that at some frequency ranges, a hypothetical subjective related failure might occur. Overall, the proposed Lnor,w could reveal detailed insights into the in situ measured airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> compared with standard airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> values. The frequency-dependent values discussed in this paper form a basis for developing a single-number index...|$|R

40|$|Acceptable {{values for}} party wall <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> {{were derived from}} the grouped {{subjective}} ratings obtained from a field survey of 600 subjects and the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of their 300 party walls. The subjects lived in both row housing and multi-floor apartment buildings in three different Canadian cities and included both owners and renters. The survey results clearly demonstrate that residents {{are influenced by the}} amount of <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between them and their neighbour and that the effects are largely independent of the type of housing or type of tenure. Spontaneous responses show increasing negative ratings of their buildings with decreasing <b>sound</b> <b>insulation.</b> Residents with poor <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> are more likely to want to move, to be awakened by noises and to have trouble falling asleep due to noises, as well as to think that their neighbours are less considerate. Directly elicited responses are used to determine STC 55 as a realistic goal for acceptable <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> and STC 60 as a more ideal goal that would practically eliminate negative effects of neighbour's noises...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn typical {{laboratory}} volumes (50 - 80 m 3) and at {{low frequencies}} (50 - 100 Hz), the acoustic field is non-diffuse {{due to the}} presence of source and receiving room modes. Under such conditions, standard <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> measurements and descriptors are not adequate to correctly characterize the insulating property of partitions or flooring systems. The «modal approach» allows to evaluate the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> by the determination of modal transmission loss, or modal <b>sound</b> <b>insulation,</b> of a single mode passing through the partition. Proper normalization terms and an extension method to one-third octave bands are also introduced. The same approach is applied to impact <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> measurement...|$|R

However, further research is required to compare data from similar sized buildings with other structural systems, which are commonly built into existing high-rise apartment housing. Through comparisons with other structural systems, the floor impact <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> performance of the voided slab systems can be determined more accurately.|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{is an important}} topic in building acoustics measurements {{carried out in the}} field assessing the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms as well as conducted in test stands characterizing the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> properties of a building element accurately. Beyond measurement method related contributions to the uncertainty budget there is the variation of the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> properties of the building element itself. According to several studies conducted in the past this uncertainty due to the building element properties can be of a significant quantity. The results of a recent study show that certain aspects of workmanship have significant influence on the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> characteristics of light weight building elements, e. g. timber frame partitions. The method to fasten the planking (e. g. gypsum boards, gypsum fiber boards or chipboards) can lead to considerable variations regarding the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> characteristics and thus to influence also the single values, with variations of the sound reduction index Rw of up to 10 dB. The mounting (i. e. the arrangement of the screws) has considerable influence on the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> properties of this kind of partitions. The airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> can be significantly influenced by the number of the screws and by the degree of how firmly they are fixed. The influence of construction details, workmanship, and suggestions how to face this problem will be discussed in the paper. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In many {{practical}} cases, {{the objective}} measures of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> using standard procedures {{do not agree}} with subjective assessments. This paper describes a calculation scheme based on the loudness level linked to the specific fluctuation strength and yields a weighted normalized loudness level difference. Evidence has been presented through a subjective evaluation that the model can be considered to be a link between an objective and subjective evaluation. The stimuli offered in the experiment were electronically filtered sound samples representing the <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> of interest. Steady-state and non-steady state signals are used as stimuli. To differentiate the signal in terms of psychoacoustic measures, investigations of music type signals were focused on specific fluctuation strength. An assessment of identical airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> experimental results has shown that steady-state signals were assessed to be significantly quieter than non-steady-state signals, which also yield greater specific fluctuation strength. As expected, <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> was judged differently for different sound samples. A simple level difference is shown not to exhibit the effects of a given signal to the frequency-dependent airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> curve.
