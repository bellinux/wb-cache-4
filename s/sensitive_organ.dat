A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes—in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities.

40|$|Children who undergo {{examinations}} with {{ionizing radiation}} {{have a higher}} risk of cancer. Children are more sensitive to ionizing radiation, since their bodies are developing and are more susceptible to the effects of radiation. The risk of cancer increases with a higher radiation dose.

It is important to protect radiosensitive organs in children. The aim {{of the study was to}} study the physical radiation shielding if it reduces the radiation dose to <b>sensitive</b> <b>organs</b> in children, and if there are any obstacles to use these. 11 articles were selected for review and included in the analysis.

60|$|Ralph, {{on leaving}} Oxford, {{had spent a}} couple of years in travelling; after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his father's bank. The {{responsibility}} and honour of such positions is not, I believe, measured by the height of the stool, which depends upon other considerations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fond of standing, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise, however, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the end of some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out of health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on his lungs and threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work and apply, to the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. At first he slighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself in the least he was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterested person with whom he had nothing in common. This person, however, improved on acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging tolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him. Misfortune makes strange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that he had something at stake in the matter--it usually struck him as his reputation for ordinary wit--devoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of which note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping the poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began to heal, the other promised to follow its example, and he was assured he might outweather a dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which consumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grown extremely fond of London, he cursed the flatness of exile: {{but at the same time}} that he cursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found his <b>sensitive</b> <b>organ</b> grateful even for grim favours, he conferred them with a lighter hand. He wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in the sun, stopped at home when the wind blew, went to bed when it rained, and once or twice, when it had snowed overnight, almost never got up again.|$|E
