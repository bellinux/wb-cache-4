5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill <b>stay</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E

25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E
25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} attacks, the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara issued {{multiple}} security warnings {{through its}} Facebook page and on its website. They reported that there were several blockades across Jalisco and Colima, {{and that there were}} vehicles, gasolines, banks, and other buildings set on fire during the attacks. It warned its employees in Jalisco about the attacks and blockades, and asked them to remain at home until the situation was resolved by law enforcement. Their warning also extended to U.S. tourist planning to visit Jalisco, and asked them to avoid visiting the area. They asked U.S. citizens to look out for any public announcements by the Mexican government. The consulate was closed for International Workers' Day (celebrated on May 1), but they said they were re-opening their offices on Monday, May 4. The warning concluded by suggesting U.S. citizens traveling or living in Mexico to consult the alerts and warnings page at the website of the U.S. Department of State. The Embassy of Canada, Mexico City also warned Canadians to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> limit their outdoor activities.|$|E

500|$|Saadiq toured {{for about}} two years to promote The Way I See It, {{performing}} in venues throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. He was originally apprehensive at the prospect of touring extensively, having toured minimally as a solo act. He reconsidered at the advice of his rhythm guitarist Rob Bacon, which he recounted in an interview for the Los Angeles Times: [...] "The money was just OK, so I was like, 'I don't know – I could probably <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> find something better,' But then Rob reminded me, 'You know, all those cats you love, that's exactly what they did. Little Richard? He played 10 shows a day at the Apollo.' I said, 'OK, let's go.'" [...] To complement his songs' style, Saadiq adopted a vintage soul image and, having studied footage of classic soul groups and album sleeves, donned old-fashioned attire and performed R dance moves at shows. He wore a yellow tailored suit, while his nine-piece backing band wore black suits. The band included a horn section and backup singer Erika Jerry.|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who {{were thought to be}} easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
