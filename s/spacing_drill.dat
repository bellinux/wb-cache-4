40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the alternative applications on thinning based upon excessive manual labour in cotton production in Turkey`s field conditions. For this purpose, two different thinning systems were studied as alternative to conventional thinning system. Hand thinning, which is one of these systems, was applied through sparse sowing in low sowing norm using the pneumatic <b>spacing</b> <b>drill.</b> In the other system, thinning procedure was done with the rotary thinner after conventional sowing. The results were compared according to the parameters of emergence degree, working time requirements, cost and seed cotton yield. Finally, no differences were observed among the emergence degree values related to the systems applied. However, according to time requirements the lowest value (112. 86 h ha - 1) was obtained in the system which involved the use of rotary thinner. In terms of cost rotary thinner was 23. 18 and 30. 99 $ ha - 1 cheaper when compared to sparse sowing and conventional system, respectively. Thus, it was more economical than the other systems. Similarly, the highest value of seed cotton yield (4720. 95 kg ha - 1) was observed when the rotary thinner system was used...|$|E
40|$|Landau Colliery {{is one of}} Anglo Thermal Coal’s mines {{that want}} to {{investigate}} {{the economic impact of}} both the drilling and blasting process on the overburden removal process (Dragline), they want to know how the drilling process, blasting process and the earth removal process economically affect the mine. The project is based at Kromdraai opencast, one of the mine’s sections which is situated in Witbank. The project is done in order to improve productivity and the cost incurred on both processes, since the mine is spending more cash on the three processes where as the productivity does not improve. The mine considered making investments on both processes; however the project analysis will assist the company to make a decision, as to which process to invest in. During the investigation factors affecting each of the three processes will be considered {{in order to determine the}} root cause of the problems. Factors such as <b>spacing,</b> <b>drill</b> hole diameter, bench height, explosive amount, rock density etc will be considered during the analysis. Statistical and cost analysis will be used as the tools to solve the productivity and cost problems experienced at Landau Colliery. Statistical analysis will be done on accuracy, fragmentation, and dig-ability and cost analysis on the ground engagement tools. The solutions to the problems will be developed with the help of the studies that were done by other authors and by the company on fragmentation, accuracy, and dig-ability. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|Aims Wheat (Triticum aestivum) {{tillering}} characteristics {{provide an}} important basis for controlling population dynamic structure. However, studies on maximum tillering potential and different sowing methods and row spacings are lacking for different varieties. Our {{objective was to}} examine the maximum tillering potential and exploreproper sowing methods and row allocation to increase the yield of different tillering types. Methods The experiment was conducted on the farm of Shandong Agricultural University, Tai’an, China, using large-spike (Shannong 8355 and Lankao Aizao 8) and multiple-spike (Jimai 20 and Lumai 14) cultivars. Broadcast and seed drilling (row spacing of 30, 25, 20 and 15 cm) treatments were used in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Every treatment added dibble seeding with 30 cm plant spacing. Plot area is 8 m 2. Important findings The two types have higher tillering ability with dibble seeding, but there are significant differences in spike number and spike rate. Canopy microclimate has greater influence on the two types than do genetic factors. The large-spike cultivar has a higher degree of response on the colony environment than the multiple-spike cultivar. Canopy structure can be effectively controlled by seeding mode. Drilling makes significantly higher economic yield than broadcast seeding. The degree of response to row spacing differs among the varieties. It is suggested that a suitable combination of cultivar and row spacing could effectively increase grain yield, with the row spacing 23. 4 – 23. 9 cm for multiple-spike cultivars and 16. 5 – 16. 9 cm for large-spike cultivars. Broadcast seeding and narrow <b>spacing</b> <b>drill</b> seeding increase tillering and the canopy light interception (LI) of the upper and central portion in the booting and filling stage, but reduce the number of grains and kernel weight.

40|$|Deep <b>space</b> <b>drilling</b> is {{necessary}} for appropriate chemical and biological sampling for subsurface exploration. The Smart <b>Space</b> <b>Drilling</b> System (SSDS), which is currently being developed at Northeastern University (NU), is a compact self-propelled, steerable electromechanical drilling system that can penetrate into large depths in planetary bodies. In this paper we present the detailed design and modeling of the SSDS. Its main components are: a) the drill bit/cuttings bucket, b) the rotary propulsion unit including three 3 -degree of freedom (DOF) propulsion actuators, c) the power/control module, d) the non-rotating steering unit including three 1 -DOF steering actuators and e) the communication module. Three 3 -DOF propulsion actuators uniformly distributed around the rotary propulsion unit impart rotating, linear motion to the drilling bit, while another three 1 -DOF steering actuators provide the steering force for automatic directional control. The SSDS is propelled {{in the manner of}} a turning screw, which offers simpler kinematics structure, higher efficiency and thus, potential for miniaturization and deep drilling. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the SSDS were conducted to predict, design and optimize its performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{subsurface}} {{correlation of}} sand bodies and other stratigraphic units {{is an essential}} component in many regolith studies and {{it is vital to}} both land management and economic geology. Applications in regolith studies include: subsurface mapping; determining aquifer hydraulic properties; and, determining the extent of salt stores. Distribution of sandstone bodies in the regolith is important in economic geology when such units host economic deposits, including mineral sands, gold or uranium. These issues {{are an important part of}} regolith studies of the Murray-Darling, Eucla, Eyre, and Perth Basins, in palaeodrainages in many locations, and in coastal deposits of north Queensland. In most cases data about the actual distribution of such units is sparse, based on widely <b>spaced</b> <b>drill</b> holes with limited geophysical data in between. Correlation is typically by 'join the dots', however, the assumptions on how the apparently simple task of dot-joining is carried out have a major impact on unit extent and connectivity. Correlation assumptions are based on models of regolith architecture in the mind of the dot-joiner, in other words, how weathered zones and volcano-sedimentary successions are organised in space. Therefore, the accuracy of the conceptual models of subsurface architecture determines the accuracy of the correlation as only rarely will the data density be sufficiently high to allow the direct mapping of the distribution of a particular unit.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{the design process}} and testing results for a pneumatically actuated, manually-operated tool for confined <b>space</b> <b>drilling</b> operations. The purpose of this device is to back-drill pilot holes inside a commercial airplane wing. It is lightweight, and a “locator pin” enables the operator to align the drill over a pilot hole. A suction pad stabilizes the system, and an air motor and flexible drive shaft power the drill. Two testing procedures were performed to determine the practicality of this prototype. The first was the “offset drill test”, which qualified the exit hole position error due to an initial position error relative to the original pilot hole. The results displayed a linear relationship, and {{it was determined that}} position errors of less than. 060 ” would prevent the need for rework, with errors of up to. 030 ” considered acceptable. For the second test, a series of holes were drilled with the pneumatic tool and analyzed for position error, diameter range, and cycle time. The position errors and hole diameter range were within the allowed tolerances. The average cycle time was 45 seconds, 73 percent of which was for drilling the hole, and 27 percent of which was for positioning the device. Recommended improvements are discussed in the conclusion, and include a more durable flexible drive shaft, a damper for drill feed control, and a more stable locator pin...|$|R
