40|$|<b>Social</b> network <b>analysis</b> {{is a new}} {{research}} field in data mining. <b>Social</b> network <b>analysis</b> {{is the study of}} social networks to recognize the structure and behavior of friends. <b>Social</b> network <b>analysis</b> views <b>social</b> relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and ties. The defining feature of <b>social</b> network <b>analysis</b> is its focus on the structure of relationships, ranging from casual acquaintance to close bonds. <b>Social</b> network <b>analysis</b> assumes that relationships are very essential. The main aspect of the <b>social</b> network <b>analysis</b> is clustering. The clustering in <b>social</b> network <b>analysis</b> is different from conventional clustering techniques. It needs grouping objects into classes depending on their links as well as their attributes. The conventional clustering approaches group objects only based on objects? similarity and it cannot be applied to <b>social</b> network <b>analysis.</b> So on the basis of BSP (Business System Planning) clustering algorithm, a <b>social</b> network clustering <b>analysis</b> algorithm is proposed. Moreover, before applying clustering, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied. Thus proposed algorithm, different from traditional BSP clustering algorithms, can group objects in a social network into different classes based on their links and identify relation among classes dynamically & require less amount of memory...|$|R

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. <b>Social</b> <b>analysis</b> has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E

25|$|Sociology as a {{scholarly}} discipline emerged primarily out of enlightenment thought, {{shortly after the}} French Revolution, as a positivist science of society. Its genesis owed to various key movements {{in the philosophy of}} science and the philosophy of knowledge. <b>Social</b> <b>analysis</b> in a broader sense, however, has origins in the common stock of philosophy and necessarily pre-dates the field. Modern academic sociology arose as a reaction to modernity, capitalism, urbanization, rationalization, secularization, colonization and imperialism. Late 19th century sociology demonstrated a particularly strong interest in the emergence of the modern nation state; its constituent institutions, its units of socialization, and its means of surveillance. An emphasis on the concept of modernity, rather than the Enlightenment, often distinguishes sociological discourse from that of classical political philosophy.|$|E

500|$|The final {{discussion}} in the work is concerned with Russell's views on education. (Russell 1938:242–251) Citizens of a healthy democracy must have two virtues, for Russell: the [...] "sense of self-reliance and confidence" [...] necessary for autonomous action; and the humility required to [...] "submit {{to the will of}} the majority" [...] when it has spoken.
