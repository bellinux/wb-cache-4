Fox's appeal was rejected and the decision was upheld by Sir Paul Kennedy, a former high court judge. Fox stated that his decision to remortgage his second home to pay for redecorations and claim the higher interest repayments on his expenses represented value for money because he could have charged the taxpayer for the decorating bills directly. In his response, Sir Paul Kennedy stated: [...] "What you claimed was not recoverable under the rules then in force. I entirely accept that, like many others, you could have made other claims if the fees office had rejected your claims for mortgage interest, and that you may well have spent <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> raised by increasing your mortgage on your constituency home, but the evidence is imprecise, and my terms of reference only allow me to interfere if I find special reasons in your individual case showing {{that it would not}} be fair and equitable to require repayment, either at all or at the level recommended." [...] This reportedly made him the Conservative Shadow Cabinet member with the largest over-claim on expenses, and as a result, he has been forced to repay the most money.|$|E
5000|$|Triay’s first book, Fleeing Castro: Operation Pedro Pan and the Cuban Children’s Program, was {{the first}} book length work {{published}} about the exodus of more than 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children from Communist Cuba and the federally-sponsored program that provided them care in the United States. Operation Pedro Pan was the largest movement of unaccompanied refugee children {{in the history of}} the Western Hemisphere. On the question of whether or not the programs were morally justified (in light of the trauma of family separation), Triay emphatically believes that, given the rise of a totalitarian Communist state in Cuba, the parents of the Operation Pedro Pan children were validated in sending their offspring out of the country and to the United States. He said, “Anything that parents feared happened. They were dead on. They were almost prophetic.” He also stated, “They sent their kids into the hands of U.S. agencies and the Catholic Church rather than let Fidel Castro raise them.” [...] Three years later, Triay published Bay of Pigs: An Oral History of Brigade 2506, a historical account of the Bay of Pigs invasion through the eyes of the men in the U.S.-sponsored liberation army. Triay was awarded the Florida Historical Society’s Samuel Proctor Oral History Prize in 2001 for Bay of Pigs. The work was subsequently picked up by Random House for release in Spanish translation, releasing it in 2003 under the title, La Patria Nos Espera. Triay, who knew several Brigade veterans during his upbringing, said of his motives for writing the book, ``I felt there was a tremendous distortion in the works others did about the Cuban-American experience, and my goal as a historian has been to be honest about what happened and clarify some of those distortions. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> read made the exiles look like a bunch of blind, maniacal, machete-wielding anti-Communist, anti-Castro fanatics.

A word of advice to students: never let the fact that you do not altogether know what you are talking about keep you from talking. After all, not knowing what they are talking about does not stop your parents from talking, does it? And how do you think professors could possibly lecture for an entire semester without occasionally talking about things that they don’t know much about?

40|$|About {{this book}} It is now {{fourteen}} years since we collaborated {{in the writing}} of our first research methods book. In 2009 the fifth edition was published (Saunders et al., 2009). The success of that book suggests that research methods is a popular subject with business and management students. This may be so. But we think that it {{has more to do with}} the fact research methods is a complex area- one where it is easy to do things, but much less easy to do things right. When we planned the first book we had one overall mission in mind. That was to write a book in a way that came as near as possible to the way in which we taught our students. By this we mean that we wanted to be clear and straightforward, and explain things in a way that lost none of the complexity, or academic rigour of the subject. Over the years this mission has not altered. We feel just as passionate about clear communication as we did back in 1997. However, things in the world of business and management education have changed since 1997, and this book reflects those changes. In 1997 the normal requirement was for undergraduate students in their final year, to undertake a large piece of research which involved them in collecting their own data and was assessed by means of a written project report. This is now often not the case. Although some degree programmes still require students to complete an assessed research project, they may be told that, rather than collect their own data, they should use only data that have already been collected for some other purpose (secondary data), or alternatively, write an extended review of the literature. For a second category of students on undergraduate programmes the extent of their research work is a research methods module which is assessed by a research proposal. There is a third category, those business and management students who opt not to do a research project at all. We have written this book to cater for all three categories of student. For those undertaking research to be assessed by a written project report we aim to help in all aspects of the research process; from thinking of a topic through to writing the final submission. We therefore include material, in chapter three, on managing the research process; as well as chapters on using secondary data (chapter 4) and reviewing the literature (chapter 2). There are also two chapters (6 and 7) on collecting and analysing data as an understanding of these is important for all types of research projects as well as preparing a research proposal. If you’re taking a research methods module which is assessed by a research proposal you will find that there is considerable emphasis upon the preparation of a research proposal. Indeed, chapter 8 deals specifically with writing the research proposal. It may sound strange, but we think that business and management students in the third category, those who opt not to do a research project at all, can gain just as much from this book as those in the other two categories. As a student you will spend much of your time studying material which is the result of careful research which has been scrutinised by the research community prior to publication. This scrutiny is a guarantee of good quality: that you should put your faith in what you have read. However, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> read may not have been through quite such a rigorous process. Knowing something about the research process enables you to ask the right questions of the material you are studying. It gives you the sense of healthy scepticism that is the hallmark of a university education. How you might use this book We don’t anticipate that you will read this book progressively from chapter 1 through to chapter 8. In fact, you may not read all the chapters, although we certainly hope that you will! The reason we suspect is that you will choose those chapters that meet your own needs. This may be because you are in one of the categories we mentioned earlier, have specific questions about the research process you need to answer, or it may be that your research methods lecturers specify certain chapters. We’ve written the chapters in such a way that they stand alone. To some extent they draw inevitably on material from other chapters directly. Where this is so, we have cross- referenced to the relevant chapter. But the point remains that you can pick up any chapter in isolation and make sense of it. This book is not a self-study text in the truest sense; there are no questions with model answers! However, we have included points in each chapter which facilitate an element of independent learning. Each chapter begins with a summary of content which we call 'Why read this chapter?’ This gives you some idea of the chapter content and the approach we have taken to the topic being discussed. Each chapter contains a small number of examples of research called 'Research in Practice'. These serve to illustrate in a practical manner some of the points being made in the chapter, in much the same way as a lecturer would give practical examples in a research methods lecture. Every chapter ends with a summary of the main points in the chapter and a section called ‘Thinking about …’ Here we make suggestions as to how you may test and reinforce the learning you have achieved during the reading of the chapter. Throughout the book key research terms we use are isolated and placed in ‘Key terms definition’ boxes to make it easy for you to refresh your understanding of these terms as you read through chapter. What’s in the book? Chapter 1 deals with the first issue you will encounter in the research process: choosing the right research topic. We suggest some novel ways in which you may decide upon your topic, offer guidance in deciding what constitutes an effective research topic, and consider some topics which may be problematic. In the latter part of the chapter we deal with the issue of defining suitable research questions and objectives. The chapter ends with a discussion on what is meant by the all important term ‘theory’. In chapter 2 we approach the subject of the literature review. We offer some practical suggestions on the way you may go about approaching your literature review and actually conducting it, particularly through the use of information technology. The chapter also explains what constitutes an effective critical literature review and offers guidance in how it may be structured. Chapter 3 is concerned with practical issues concerning gaining access to work organizations from which you may collect your own research data. In this chapter we also consider the issues of self-management you may face in conducting your research, particularly the effective use of resources such as time. The management of other aspects of the research process is also discussed, such as your supervisor, university and those from whom you collect your data. We also help you to think about the ways in which you adhere to the code of research ethics that you will be required to observe. In chapter 4 we consider the use of secondary data. We discuss the valuable role which secondary data may play in your research and the reasons you may use secondary data. The ready availability of a wealth of secondary data, particularly as a result of the growth of the Internet is considered. We also warn you about some of the pitfalls inherent in the use of secondary data and how to assess its value to your own research project. The subject of chapter 5 is research strategy. This involves a consideration of the main philosophies you may adopt and the ways in which they affect choice of strategy. We discuss the different types of research strategy, with an emphasis upon the possibility of mixing strategies in one research project. We end the chapter with a discussion about the importance of validity and reliability: ensuring that your research results and conclusions are believable. Chapter 6 gets to the heart of the research process: the collection of data. We explain how to: choose a sample; draft an effective questionnaire and conduct effective interviews in their various forms, including electronic means. In chapter 7 we deal with the process of data analysis. We discuss the two types of data: quantitative and qualitative and the ways in which these data may be prepared for analysis and actually analysed. The use of statistics in both the presentation and analysis of data is explained with particular emphasis upon the use of different software packages. We also discuss ways in which qualitative data may be prepared for analysis and analysed. As with the analysis of quantitative data we emphasise the way in which you may develop theory from the analysed data. Chapter 8 is devoted to the writing of your research proposal. We explain how the process of writing clarifies your ideas and we emphasise the importance of treating the research proposal as an item of ‘work in progress’ by constantly revising it. The chapter also includes a discussion on what content the proposal should contain; how it may be structured and the appropriate writing style to be adopted. Finally, we suggest some of the criteria against which the quality of your research proposal may be assessed. We hope you will learn a lot from this book, that’s why it exists! But we also hope that you will enjoy reading it. Doing your research project should be fun! Mark and Phil Reference Saunders, M., Lewis, P. and Thornhill, A. (2009).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relation between}} bodily awareness and bodily agency. Descartes‘s observation {{that we are not}} in our bodies as pilots in vessels suggests two thoughts about the special role of the body in experience and agency. The first is that we experience our bodies ‗from the inside‘ and not just as one more material body amongst other material objects of perception (Feeling). The second is that we are able to act with our bodies in ways in which we are not with any other bodies or objects (Direct Control). My goal is to articulate the proper relationship between Feeling and Direct Control. There are three broad options: they are independent (Independence); Feeling is because of Direct Control (Enaction); and Direct Control is because of Feeling (Necessity). Independence cannot make sense of the rational role of experience in guiding action. Finding Independence unsatisfactory is the force of intuition toward articulating <b>some</b> kind <b>of</b> intimate connexion between bodily awareness and bodily agency. Enaction is subject to counterexamples from paralysed subjects, pain in body parts (such as internal organs) that we cannot act with, and double dissociations between bodily awareness and bodily action. The most attractive option is Necessity, but it is still empirically inadequate. Whilst the intimacy between bodily awareness and agency is not in doubt, the counterexamples suggest that their relation cannot quite be understood in the way that Necessity claims. I develop a view on which bodily awareness is necessary for bodily agency, but not for the online control of actions (as Necessity claims). Rather, bodily awareness plays an essential role in action planning, since to plan an action is to have <b>some</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can do – which requires body schemata and awareness of current bodily dispositions. ...|$|R

What drove Tommy oftenest to the weary drudgery was, perhaps, the alarm that came over him when he seemed of a sudden to hear the names of the bursars proclaimed and no Thomas Sandys among them. Then did he shudder, for well he knew that Aaron would keep his threat, and he hastily covered the round table with books and sat for hours sorrowfully pecking at them, every little while to discover that his mind had soared to other things, when he hauled it back, as one draws in a reluctant kite. On these occasions Aaron seldom troubled him, except by glances that, nevertheless, brought the kite back more quickly than if they had been words of warning. If Elspeth was present, the warper might sit moodily by the fire, but when the man and the boy were left together, one or other of them soon retired, as if this was the only way of preserving the peace. Though determined to keep his word to Jean Myles liberally, Aaron had never liked Tommy, and Tommy's avoidance of him is easily accounted for; he knew that Aaron did not admire him, and unless you admired Tommy he was always a boor in your presence, shy and self-distrustful.
