5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional <b>speculative</b> fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by <b>speculative</b> fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of <b>speculative</b> fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of <b>speculative</b> fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>speculative</b> fiction on {{television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major <b>speculative</b> fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, <b>speculative</b> fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes <b>speculative</b> fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in <b>speculative</b> fiction.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{creation}} in 1995, awards {{have been given}} in various categories of <b>speculative</b> fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, <b>speculative</b> young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in <b>speculative</b> fiction. The awards have {{attracted the attention of}} publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has added weight to the honour of the award.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>speculative</b> {{expansion}} proposals exist for new lines to Stockport, a loop around Wythenshawe, {{and the addition}} of tram-train technology.|$|E
5|$|Infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations}} of the Lorentz group appear by restriction of the irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations of}} the Poincaré group acting on the Hilbert spaces of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. But these are also of mathematical interest and of potential direct physical relevance in other roles {{than that of a}} mere restriction. There were <b>speculative</b> theories, (tensors and spinors have infinite counterparts in the expansors of Dirac and the expinors of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but they have found no proven physical application. Modern <b>speculative</b> theories potentially have similar ingredients per below.|$|E
5|$|Lamarckism was popularised in the English-speaking {{world by}} the <b>speculative</b> Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{published}} anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Legends and <b>speculative</b> fiction {{reveal a}} longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, pre-Columbian Mexico, the United States, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{people were}} not diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime. A retrospective diagnosis is <b>speculative</b> and, as detailed below, can be wrong.|$|E
5|$|Harlan Ellison, noted {{author of}} <b>speculative</b> fiction, {{was born in}} Cleveland in 1934; his family {{subsequently}} moved to the nearby suburb of Painesville, though Ellison moved back to Cleveland in 1949. As a youngster, he published a series of short stories appearing in the Cleveland News; he also performed {{in a number of}} productions for the Cleveland Play House.|$|E
5|$|He is {{recognized}} as an originator of the social science fiction genre in Polish science fiction, known in Poland as the sociological <b>speculative</b> fiction (fantastyka socjologiczna). He has been an inspiration {{to a number of}} younger Polish science fiction authors such as Maciej Parowski and Marek Oramus.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{several other}} bones, {{including}} a jawless skull, {{were found in}} a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are {{also referred to as}} Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains <b>speculative</b> and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very <b>speculative</b> sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a <b>speculative</b> mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} {{that there may be}} a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the <b>speculative</b> nature of his seventh stage.|$|E
5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} <b>speculative</b> fiction {{refer to the}} {{incorporation}} of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres. Such elements may include an LGBT character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the hetero-normative.|$|E
5|$|Several {{organisms are}} capable of rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not appear to play a {{significant}} role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in <b>speculative</b> fiction.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan {{organized}} {{the narrative of}} Unbreakable to parallel a comic book's traditional three-part story structure. After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a <b>speculative</b> screenplay with Bruce Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>speculative</b> {{theories}} {{have proposed that}} our Universe {{is but one of}} a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe. Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as alternate planes of consciousness and simulated reality.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles. Although <b>speculative,</b> this layout {{is supported by the}} illustration in the Anthony Roll and the gun inventories.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronological order}} of the kings from the second kingdom era is highly uncertain; nevertheless, {{it is assumed that}} the letter of Enna-Dagan lists them in a chronological order. Many of the kings were attested through their own votive objects {{discovered}} in the city, and the dates are highly <b>speculative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in <b>speculative</b> fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in <b>speculative</b> fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The other {{buildings}} are {{a group of}} three brick three-story rowhouses called York Row. Built in 1807 in the Federal style, they are an early example of <b>speculative</b> housing development. York Row was built at a time when Philadelphia's population was shifting westward, away from the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{informed}} by events {{prior to the}} Great Depression when – {{in the opinion of}} Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and <b>speculative</b> uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have, or had, the medical {{condition}} epilepsy. Following from that, there is a short list of people who have received a <b>speculative,</b> retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy. Finally there is a substantial list of people who are often wrongly believed to have had epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was <b>speculative</b> activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain <b>speculative</b> rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., <b>speculative</b> trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains <b>speculative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His <b>speculative</b> reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|At the 52nd British Academy Film Awards, Weir (Direction), Niccol (Original Screenplay) and Dennis Gassner (Production Design) {{received}} awards. In addition, {{the film}} was nominated for Best Film and Best Visual Effects. Harris was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and Peter Biziou was nominated for Best Cinematography. The Truman Show was a success at The Saturn Awards, where it won the Best Fantasy Film and the Best Writing (Niccol). Carrey (Best Actor), Harris (Best Supporting Actor) and Weir (Direction) also received nominations. Finally, the film won <b>speculative</b> fiction's Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either <b>speculative</b> or dependent on market incentives, {{it is probable that}} there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Metrolink {{has been}} a key {{strategy}} of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a and 3b with the most recent phase, 2CC becoming operational in February 2017. Construction work on the Trafford Park Line extension from Pomona to the Trafford Centre commenced in early 2017 with an estimated operational date of 2020/21. Furthermore, TfGM have endorsed more <b>speculative</b> expansion proposals for new lines to Stockport, a loop around Wythenshawe, {{and the addition of}} tram-train technology.|$|E
5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are <b>speculative.</b> Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated <b>speculative</b> investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and <b>speculative</b> than technical works.|$|E
5|$|In January 1909, Austro-Hungarian admirals {{circulated}} {{a document}} {{calling for a}} fleet of four dreadnoughts. A constitutional crisis in 1909–10 meant no construction could be approved. In spite of this, two dreadnoughts were laid down by shipyards on a <b>speculative</b> basis – due especially to the energetic manipulations of Rudolf Montecuccoli, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy – and later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all , were {{to be accompanied by}} a further four ships, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
