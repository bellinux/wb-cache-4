50|$|Adoption in France is codified in the French Civil Code in two {{distinct}} forms: <b>simple</b> <b>adoption</b> and plenary adoption.|$|E
50|$|Plenary {{adoption}} {{is the only}} act of filiation which carries direct effects on nationality. Unlike the process of <b>simple</b> <b>adoption,</b> a child adopted according to the procedure of plenary adoption breaks any bond with his family of origin.|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} {{access and}} sharing in multimedia social networks (MSNs) mainly rely on access control models and mechanisms. <b>Simple</b> <b>adoptions</b> of security {{policies in the}} traditional access control model cannot effectively establish a trust relationship among parties. This paper proposed a novel two-party trust architecture (TPTA) to apply in a generic MSN scenario. According to the architecture, security policies are adopted through game-theoretic analyses and decisions. Based on formalized utilities of security policies and security rules, the choice of security policies in content access {{is described as a}} game between the content provider and the content requester. By the game method for the combination of security policies utility and its influences on each party’s benefits, the Nash equilibrium is achieved, that is, an optimal and stable combination of security policies, to establish and enhance trust among stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdoption law in France and Italy {{is quite}} similar, {{and since the}} 1990 s, these two {{countries}} have been among those which adopt the largest numbers of children from abroad. But over a longer timescale, what are {{the similarities and differences}} in their adoption practices ? This article retraces the history of adoption law and practices in France and Italy since the nineteenth century. While adoption law in the two countries has followed a similar trajectory, the actual numbers of <b>simple</b> <b>adoptions</b> are very different, mainly because far fewer stepfamilies are formed after divorce in Italy than in France. By contrast, the number of full adoptions and the characteristics of the children concerned are similar in both countries. After facing a scarcity of domestic adoptable children, potential adopters have, since 2011, been confronted with a drop in the number of minors available for intercountry adoption. As a consequence, intercountry adoptees in France and Italy tend to be older, and more often have siblings and/or health problems or disabilities than in the past...|$|R
40|$|Farming {{practices}} {{are known to}} exert strong control over the soils’ function to act as sources or sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper deals with {{the outcome of a}} recent meta-analysis based on the evaluation of 19 published long-term farming system comparisons. It provides a comprehensive data base regarding GHG fluxes from soils under organic and non-organic management. There is scientific evidence for lower nitrous oxide emissions from organically managed soils when scaled to the area. However, further data from farming system comparisons are required, particularly from long-term GHG measurements covering several cropping seasons or ideally entire crop rotations. This enables closing knowledge gaps concerning N fluxes and pools under organic management as well as the formation of the new soil ecosystem (soil quality) equilibrium after implementing organic practices. Substantial reductions of nitrous oxide emissions as well as enhancement of methane uptake can be reached by consequent application of “good agricultural practice” and <b>simple</b> <b>adoptions</b> of soil management, forming together a balanced set of GHG mitigation mechanisms. In addition we provide first GHG flux data from the well-known DOK farming system trial in Therwil/CH and the role of microbial communities driving soil functioning...|$|R

50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>{{adoption}}</b> (adoption simple) {{is a type}} {{of adoption}} which allows some of the legal bonds between an adopted child and his or her birth family to remain. It is formalized under articles 343 and following of the French Civil Code.|$|E
50|$|On 6 February 2013, the Chamber's Legal Affairs Committee {{agreed to}} approve the measure opening {{marriage}} for same-sex couples. On 20 February, the committee initially backed the right to <b>simple</b> <b>adoption</b> for same-sex couples, but restricting plenary adoption to opposite-sex couples. On 6 March 2013, the committee confirmed that position. However, on 4 June, the Council of State issued a second review, rejecting the compromise to allow <b>simple</b> <b>adoption</b> for all couples while restricting plenary adoption to opposite-couples only. On 19 June 2013, the Legal Affairs Committee decided to back full adoption rights for same-sex couples. The bill {{was expected to be}} voted on by Parliament in the autumn of 2013, however a further delay was caused by the elections in October 2013 following the resignation of the Luxembourgish Government.|$|E

5000|$|In other nations, {{a form of}} [...] "incomplete adoption" [...] {{may allow}} {{filiation}} with the natural family to remain.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, many states have taken steps to ban smoking in public areas. The process of {{specific}} polices spreading across state lines is called policy diffusion. Statewide anti-indoor smoking bans are utilized to demonstrate what the most prevailing factors in policy diffusion are. A two-step approach to analysis is implemented, first looking only at <b>simple</b> policy <b>adoption</b> among the 50 states, and secondly {{the rate at which}} the policy expands across the country. A strong presence of local ordinances, nearby neighbors with statewide bans in effect, and a history of smoking preemption laws are found to be the most statistically significant of a list of variables. Because diffusion of this policy is entering its final stages, this research can be used as a reference for designing and implementing policy diffusion studies in the future...|$|R
5000|$|Although in {{political}} reality adoption was an alternative technique {{to aim for}} the same result in terms of succession (and which succeeded in producing one genealogically [...] "false" [...] but politically satisfactory dynasty of so-called [...] "Adoptive Emperors"), constitutionally, this was a horror as the republic had never been abandoned in law. Thus monarchical succession in the Principate, however realistic, was officially out of the question, and this stigma persisted in the Dominate, despite the obviously monarchical trappings adopted by the emperors in this era. 'Designation', rather than <b>simple</b> <b>adoption,</b> could at least be justified by qualitative criteria.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{starting}} point, one of Joseph's two fathers could be by <b>simple</b> <b>adoption,</b> as Augustine suggests, {{or more likely}} the special adoption by a father-in-law with no sons, or could be a maternal grandfather. On the other hand, the resemblance between Matthan and Matthat suggests {{they are the same}} man (in which case Jacob and Eli are either identical or full brothers involved in a levirate marriage), and Matthew's departure from Luke at that point can only be to follow legal line of inheritance, perhaps through a maternal grandfather. Such reasoning could further explain what has happened with Zerubbabel and Shealtiel. [...] A key difficulty with these explanations, however, {{is that there is no}} adoption in Jewish law, which of course is the relevant law tradition even according to Jesus (Matt. 23:1-3), not the Roman law tradition. If Joseph is not the biological father, his lineage does not apply to Jesus, and there is no provision available within Jewish law for this to be altered. One's natural father is always one's father. Nor is inheritance of lineage claims even possible through one's mother, in Jewish law.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlong with {{so-called}} "full" adoption, {{there is}} in France another form known as "simple" adoption, which adds an additional descendency tie to the adoptee's tie with his family of origin. Nowadays, this form of adoption is mostly used by a step-parent without children to adopt an adult stepchild to whom there is already an attachment in order to transmit his/her estate to it. <b>Simple</b> <b>adoption,</b> about which little is known by sociologists of the family, has now become more common than full adoption. Using historical statistics from the Ministry of Justice on <b>simple</b> <b>adoption</b> since the nineteenth century, we trace {{the history of this}} institution since 1804 when it became part of French law.

30|$|Our {{first goal}} is to {{describe}} the heterogeneous behaviour presented in Fig.  3 quantitatively.

The bass model is one of the <b>simplest</b> models of <b>adoption</b> processes, and has been used to describe different adoption patterns ranging from technology to consumer products, language and citations (Bass 2004). Given its simplicity and ease of interpretation, we consider it to be a relevant model to approach this problem.|$|R

30|$|Instructional strategies, which {{refer to}} {{specific}} methods and approaches that “provide {{the conditions under}} which learning goals will most likely be attained” (Driscoll 2000, p. 344), are critical factors impacting online learning and learning experiences (Fresen 2005; Schaller et al. 2002). Few teacher education programs in the USA offer any training in learning theories or teaching pedagogies appropriate for online learning environments (Patrick and Dawley 2009). Most faculty members in higher education “have little or no formal training as teachers” and tend to teach the way they were taught (Perrin 2004, p. 4). Additionally, <b>simple,</b> unaltered <b>adoption</b> of traditional instructional methods while teaching online will not produce the desired outcome (York et al. 2007). Untrained and unprepared STEM instructors are sometimes caught in difficult circumstances when they are tasked to teach an online class.

40|$|BackgroundRates of {{musculoskeletal}} disorders in construction remain high. Few studies have described barriers and facilitators {{to the use}} of available ergonomic solutions. This paper describes these barriers and facilitators and their relationship to the level of adoption. MethodsThree analysts rated 16 proposed ergonomic solutions from a participatory ergonomics study and assessed the level of adoption, six adoption characteristics, and identified the category of adoption from a theoretical model. ResultsTwelve solutions were always or intermittently used and were rated positively for characteristics of relative advantage, compatibility with existing work processes, and trialability. Locus of control (worker vs. contractor) was not related to <b>adoption.</b> <b>Simple</b> solutions faced fewer barriers to adoption than those rated as complex. ConclusionsSpecific adoption characteristics can help predict the use of new ergonomic solutions in construction. Adoption of complex solutions must involve multiple stakeholders, more time, and shifts in culture or work systems.

40|$|We {{study the}} early {{adoption}} of Twitter in the 111 th House of Representatives. Our main {{objective is to}} determine whether successes of past adopters have the tendency to speed up Twitter adoption, where past success {{is defined as the}} average followers per Tweet - a common measure of "Twitter success" - among all prior adopters. The data suggests that accelerated adoption can be associated with favorable past outcomes: increasing the average number of followers per Tweet among past adopters by a standard deviation (of 8 followers per Tweet) accelerates the adoption time by about 112 days. This acceleration effect is weaker for those who already have adopted Facebook and those who have access to information about a large number of past adopters. We later find a positive relationship between an adopter's realized followers per Tweet and the success of adopters preceding him/her. Thus, there may exist benefits associated with adopting Twitter based on past successes of others. In general, the patterns we find are consistent with predictions generated by a <b>simple</b> model of <b>adoption</b> delay with learning. ...|$|R
