5|$|Eros Bendato ("Eros Bound"; 1999) {{is a large}} bronze head by {{sculptor}} Igor Mitoraj. Located on {{the corner}} of Eighth and Market streets, the statue lays sideways on a slanted granite circle, which is covered by a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933. This {{was followed by a}} <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> films, including the highly regarded Footlight Parade, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. His next notable film was 1934's Here Comes the Navy, which paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first time. The two would have an enduring friendship.|$|E

5000|$|The years 1895-1914 saw {{the peak}} of European immigration; the new arrivals were mostly Catholics or Jews, {{especially}} Italians and Poles as well as Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe. There were smaller but <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Old immigration" [...] sources in Ireland, Britain and Germany. The residents of Little Germany, {{in what is now}} the East Village dispersed to more affluent neighborhoods and were replaced by growing numbers of poorer immigrants on the Lower East Side.|$|R
50|$|Cash {{cows are}} {{products}} or services that have achieved market leader status, provide positive cash flows and a return on assets (ROA) that exceeds the market growth rate. The idea is that such products produce profits long after the initial investment has been recouped. By generating <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> income, cash cows help fund the overall growth of a company, their positive effects spilling over to other business units. Furthermore, companies can use them as leverage for future expansions, as lenders {{are more willing to}} lend money knowing that the debt will be serviced.|$|R
5|$|Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, with a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> {{reform and}} {{attempts}} to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw {{the beginnings of a}} slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.|$|E
5|$|At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main {{responsibilities}} were {{to analyze}} and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> articles for The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Royal Edward Dock {{was built}} in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was {{constructed}} {{on the opposite side}} of the mouth of the Avon, making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock. In 1977 Charles Hill & Sons, the last shipbuilder at the Albion Yard, closed after delivering the 1541 tonne beer tanker Miranda Guinness. Part of the yard reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating, who still produce a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> small ferries, survey vessels, tugs and other craft.|$|E
50|$|The Worcester Commercial Bank Unlimited {{was officially}} {{established}} in 1856. Due to {{growth in the}} wagon making industry, the Bank ran into a credit crisis by 1864. Discounting of bills of exchange became difficult and investors started to withdraw their money. Only a £6000 capital injection {{by the board of}} directors saved the Bank from ruin. The discovery of diamonds brought a <b>steadier</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> prospectors travelling through Worcester. This led to the opening of more shops and lodgings and other facilities to meet their needs and a rise in the town's population.|$|R
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's <b>steadier</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{stimulation}} of the cochlea leads to a travelling wave in the cochlear fluids and on the basilar membrane (BM). It has long been suspected that this travelling wave leads to a <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> flow in the cochlea. Theoretical investigations suggested that the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> might be <b>of</b> physiological relevance. Here, we present a quantitative study <b>of</b> the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> in a computational model of a passive cochlea. The structure <b>of</b> the <b>streaming</b> flow is illustrated and the sources <b>of</b> <b>streaming</b> are closely investigated. We describe a source <b>of</b> <b>streaming</b> {{which has not been}} considered in the cochlea by previous authors. This source is also related to a steady axial displacement of the BM which leads to a local stretching of this compliant structure. We present theoretical predictions for the streaming intensity which account for these new phenomena. It is shown that these predictions compare well with our numerical results and that there may be <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> velocities <b>of</b> the order of millimetres per second. Our results indicate that <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> should be more relevant to low-frequency hearing because the strength <b>of</b> the <b>streaming</b> flow rapidly decreases for higher frequencie...|$|R
5|$|Monaco's history predates the Roman {{occupation}} of AD122. Its large natural harbour ensured a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced {{to this area}} of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War {{began when}} the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> defeats that pushed {{them back to the}} Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities.|$|E
5|$|With the Observer Corps {{passing a}} <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> reports {{regarding}} approaching German formations they soon realised a coordinated attack was under way. The two Squadrons approaching the high-altitude attack {{could not be}} diverted and no fighters {{had been asked to}} engage the 9 Staffel. The only Squadron {{on the ground in the}} area was No. 111 Squadron RAF that had 12 Hurricanes at RAF Croydon. Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
40|$|This volume {{describes}} subsonic, transonic, and supersonic facilities called {{wind tunnels}} {{in the classical}} sense; that is, facilities which provide essentially continuous <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> gas which are cool enough {{so there is no}} significant dissociation, and in which test models are generally stationary translationally.

40|$|A {{well-developed}} {{method to}} induce mixing on microscopic scales is to exploit flows generated by <b>steady</b> <b>streaming.</b> <b>Steady</b> <b>streaming</b> is a classical fluid dynamics phenomenon whereby a time-periodic forcing in the bulk or along a boundary {{is enhanced by}} inertia to induce a non-zero net flow. Building on classical work for simple geometrical forcing and motivated by the complex shape oscillations of elastic capsules and bubbles, we develop the mathematical framework to quantify the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>of</b> a spherical body with arbitrary axisymmetric time-periodic boundary conditions. We compute the flow asymptotically for small-amplitude oscillations of the boundary in the limit where the viscous penetration length scale is {{much smaller than the}} body. In that case, the flow has a boundary layer structure and the fluid motion is solved by asymptotic matching. Our results, presented in the case of no-slip boundary conditions and extended to include the motion of vibrating free surfaces, recovers classical work as particular cases. We illustrate the flow structure given by our solution and propose one application of our results for small-scale force-generation and synthetic locomotion...|$|R
50|$|Commodore Tordenskjold was {{reassigned to}} the Baltic Fleet, {{in command of}} the 64-gun ship of the line, Ebenezer. The North Sea fleet under Rear Admiral Andreas Rosenpalm pursued an unaggressive patrol {{strategy}} along the Bohuslän coast. With the Danish fleet diverted to the Baltic and the lightening of patrols from the North Sea fleet, throughout the summer <b>of</b> 1718, <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> supplies were carried up through the Bohuslän skerries and to the Norwegian border. Armaments emphasized the heavy guns, ammunition and supplies that would be necessary to take the strong border fortresses at Fredriksten in Fredrikshald. In the Autumn of 1718 Charles again attacked Norway. He was killed while inspecting the front trenches of the siege-works against Fredriksten. This precipitated an immediate retreat of his war-weary forces back to Sweden, effectively terminating the Norwegian campaigns.|$|R
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which {{raised the question of}} whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|By late 1585, {{although}} Ernst's {{brother had}} made significant inroads into the Electorate of Cologne, both sides had reached an impasse. Sizable {{portions of the}} population subscribed to the Calvinist doctrine; to support them, Calvinist Switzerland and Strassburg furnished a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> theologians, jurists, books and ideas. The Calvinist barons and counts understood the danger of Spanish intervention: it meant the aggressive introduction of the Counter-Reformation in their territories. France, {{in the person of}} Henry III, was equally interested, since the encirclement of his Kingdom by Habsburgs was cause for concern. Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits. The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, the mere rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.|$|E
5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of commissions despite this failure. Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after East Coast landscape architects. Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> commissions.|$|E

5|$|Eventually the Maceos, with Quinn, {{opened the}} Hollywood Dinner Club, {{at the time}} the most elegant night club on the Gulf Coast. The club {{featured}} crystal chandeliers, a massive dance floor, and air conditioning (a new technology at the time; the Hollywood was the first club in the nation to use it). Because of Sam's smooth personality he became the face of the nightclub. Guy Lombardo performed for the club's opening, and Sam attracted a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> celebrity performers thereafter. The club hosted one of the nation's first remote radio broadcasts, and featured Ben Bernie's orchestra (one of the nation's most famous performing groups), which was introduced by a young Walter Cronkite. The club, the first venue in the nation to offer high-class gaming, dining, and entertainment, and air-conditioning under one roof, was unique at the time.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and {{can serve as a}} useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{equipped}} with fuel injection {{do not require}} carb heat as {{they are not as}} prone to icing - the gasoline is injected as a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> just upstream <b>of</b> the intake valve, so evaporation occurs as the fuel/air mixture is being drawn into the cylinder, where metal temperatures are higher. The exception is monopoint or TBI injection systems which spray fuel onto the throttle plate.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of the fall of Lang Vei three {{companies}} of the NVA 101D Regiment moved into jump-off positions to attack Alpha-1, an outpost just outside the Combat Base held by 66 men of Company A, 1st Platoon, 1/9 Marines. At 04:15 on 8 February under cover of fog and a mortar barrage, the North Vietnamese penetrated the perimeter, overrunning most of the position and pushing the remaining 30 defenders into the southwestern portion of the defenses. For some unknown reason, the NVA troops did not press their advantage and eliminate the pocket instead throwing a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> grenades at the Marines. At 07:40 a relief force from Company A, 2nd Platoon set out from the main base and attacked through the North Vietnamese, pushing them into supporting tank and artillery fire. By 11:00 the battle was over, Company A had lost 24 dead and 27 wounded, while 150 North Vietnamese bodies were found around the position which was then abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Science and {{technology}} parks and business incubators have featured prominently on national/regional policy agendas for helping create <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> new technology-based firms and for assisting them survive and generate high value-added jobs. This paper links the relevant policies to the objectives {{and characteristics of}} the established parks and incubators in a relatively small, converging European country. The first wave of S&T parks arrived in Greece {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s and has included the establishment of seven organizations by public research institutes and universities. In addition to business incubation, local and regional development has featured prominently on the missions of these parks. A second wave of incubators is currently under way consisting of organizations fully owned and operated by the private sector. These incubators are run for profit. They keep close to the market, provide seed capital and access to venture capital, and buy into the tenant companies. Not unlike what is happening elsewhere, this gradual shift toward more private engagement in S&T parks and incubators has created a variety of models out of which, it is hoped, successful research-intensive companies will emerge in larger numbers than in the past...|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{presented in}} this communication offers {{a solution to the}} embolization problem by employing the possibility of discriminating erythrocytes from lipid particles. In addition, when fully developed and implemented clinically, it reduces the demand for allogenic blood and reduces or eliminates blood transfusion related incompatibilities. The primary acoustic radiation force equation tells us that the acoustic force can move particles either towards a node or an anti-node of a standing wave depending on their densities and compressibilities. If the particles are red blood cells and lipid droplets in blood plasma, the erythrocytes gather in the pressure node (in the centre of the channel) while the lipid particles gather in the pressure anti-nodes (by the side walls), Fig. 4. At the end of the channel the red blood cells exit through the centre outlet while the lipid particles exit through the side outlets, separating the two particle types, Fig. 5. visual observations of the separation process performed on human blood could be made, displaying <b>steady</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> lipid particles flowing along the side walls and a well defined band of red blood cells exiting the system through the centre outlet channel, Fig. 6.|$|R
