50|$|<b>Screen</b> <b>painting</b> {{was invented}} by the Czech {{immigrant}} William Oktavec to restrict the sunlight entering his produce store.

5000|$|The {{wire screen}} {{section of a}} screen door is {{typically}} painted with bucolic landscapes, still lifes, or other subjects of interest. The artist paints the scene directly onto the screen, making sure to remove excess paint from the screen's holes so the screen retains its ability to ventilate. The scene painted on the screen prevents the eye from focusing past the image, giving residents privacy without limiting their ability to look outside. While <b>screen</b> <b>painting</b> is now mostly regarded as urban kitsch,authentic examples can still be seen in Baltimore neighborhoods such as Hampden or Highlandtown.|$|E

5000|$|A {{different}} {{technique was}} to use inlays of mother of pearl, which had been used on lacquer {{since at least the}} Song dynasty and revived in popularity in the 16th century, perhaps also using tortoiseshell, ivory, and metal, especially gold for touches. The mother of pearl was often engraved and stained with colours. The mother of pearl technique was, at least initially, more expensive and produced for the court (who also used <b>screens</b> <b>painted</b> by court artists), and the filled technique apparently developed for a wealthy clientele outside the court. The screens seem to have been mostly made in Fujian province in south China, traditionally a key area for lacquer manufacturing.|$|R
