40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to check the design of the syphon which will be {{constructed}} on branch 3 & 4 of El-Sheikh Zayed Canal and will pass under Toshka Spillway Canal. The study included the different scenarios for the syphon operation and calculation of Head Loss at each scenario and its effect on the efficiency of the syphon performance. At each scenario, the separation zones and the vortex formation at all conditions, which may affect on the syphon stability and performance, were observed. The expected sedimentation rates inside the syphon, determination of its removing procedures, the velocities measurements inside the syphon and its effect on the <b>syphon</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet were also studied in the paper. For this purpose, a physical model for the Sheikh Zayed canal and the syphon body was constructed with scale 1 : 27. The model test program included all scenarios of tunnels operations. These scenarios were tested {{in order to determine the}} best inflow and outflow conditions (flow pattern and separation zones), when one, two, three or four tunnels in operation. The results indicated that the design of the inlet structure i...|$|E
