Claessens and Pennacchi derive an improved indicator of payment capacityby developing a pricing model - using option valuation techniques - that takes these three factors into account. Applying the model to bonds issued recently by Mexico and Venezuela, they find that the estimated indicator of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> often behaves differently from the raw bond prices themselves, confirming the importance of cleaning the raw prices for these three factors. In order of importance, the benefits of cleaning raw prices come first from correcting for the effects of different terms (such as fixed versus floating interest rates), followed by the value of third-party enhancements and then by the concavity of the payoff structure. They find some evidence that the new indicator of repayment capacity conforms better than the raw prices themselves to generally held beliefs about which variables drive a country's repayment capacity. In particular, they find that variables that are often assumed to be related to <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> - such as oil prices and the countries'stock market prices - are more closely (and with the right sign) associated with the new estimated measure of <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> than are the secondary market prices of the bonds.

40|$|Adapting public {{policies}} on public utilities to collective {{expectations of the}} population has always been a challenge for both central and local public authorities in Romania. The present article aims to highlight issues of applicability limits of the theory of public choice. The general objective of this research is to prove that the practicability of public choice requires conditionality of financial affordability. In this regard we use a theoretical analysis on the possibility and conditions of use of the theory of public choice in practice and an empirical analysis based on statistical data which illustrates an up to date comparison of the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> of the sanitation services, adapted to European standards, {{of the population of the}} four counties of the Western Region of Romania, Timis, Arad, Caras-Severin and Hunedoara.

The analysis results indicate that there are major discrepancies of the <b>payment</b> <b>capacity</b> and financial endurance between the population of the four counties and that the substantiation of charging public services using the principles of public choice would be unsustainable financially for a large part of the population. After clarifying these issues, the main conclusion of the study is that public choice theory application using the majority’s autonomy is possible only through an association of financial affordability barriers. The relevance of the study is to address and propose solutions to the difficult context crossed by Romanian public authorities to find integrated solutions, so as to develop community services at European level, but at the same time to remain in the sphere of needs and payment possibilities of citizens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Short-term {{resource}} adequacy is {{the ability}} of a system with a set of given resources to meet the load over the short term. In the aftermath of the 2000 – 2001 California crisis, focus on resource adequacy has come to the forefront of market design issues. Various approaches, such as <b>capacity</b> requirements, <b>capacity</b> <b>payments</b> and financial options requirements, have been proposed to ensure resource adequacy in electricity markets. We propose a design of a short-term resource adequacy program based on capacity requirements expressed in terms of a price sensitive demand curve. The program is formulated so as to give incentives for providing capacity to markets and to mete out penalties for nonperformance situations. The probabilistic modeling of the uncertainty in the availability of generating resources and in the load allows the evaluation of reliability in terms of widely-used metrics. Through the explicit representation of the strategic behavior of market players, capacity withholding impacts are directly measurable. The analysis of the proposed design and the simulation of a simple implementation show that the program results in improved reliability. Reduction of the total system costs are obtained when key program parameters are appropriately chosen. The design has proven effective under an extensive range of different scenarios in the various systems tested. The improvements attainable with the implementation of the program design are illustrated with representative simulation results on different sized systems. The proposed design with the ability to evaluate the linkage between reliability and markets contributes to the electricity market design area.
