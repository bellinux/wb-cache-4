5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August.

5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of millipede orders are <b>still</b> <b>the</b> subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods.
