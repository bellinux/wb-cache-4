Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, and moved to Asuristan, where {{he set up a}} camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to {{negotiate}} with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz.|$|E
5|$|When Sabrina {{reached her}} teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife {{experiment}} had failed and he <b>should</b> <b>send</b> her away, {{as it was}} inappropriate for Day {{to live with her}} unchaperoned. He then arranged for Sabrina to undergo experimental vocational and residential changes—first attending a boarding school, then becoming an apprentice to a dressmaker family, and eventually being employed as Day's housekeeper. Having seen changes in Sabrina, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called this off when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a lady's companion.|$|E
5|$|From 343 BC onwards, {{in order}} to try and disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his {{followers}} used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace. Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of Cardia, an ally of Philip. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, {{there was no need to}} do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens <b>should</b> <b>send</b> an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.|$|E

5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they <b>should</b> <b>send</b> the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Meade asked Grant for {{clarification}} because Grant had ordered a 4:00a.m. attack {{all along the}} line. Grant said both Humphreys and Parke should feel {{for a chance to}} push on that night, that Humphreys <b>should</b> <b>send</b> skirmishers forward and attack if the Confederates were leaving their positions. If the Confederates held their line, Grant said that Humphreys <b>should</b> <b>send</b> Miles's division down White Oak Road to reinforce Sheridan. Grant also directed that Wright, Parke and Ord, with John Gibbon's XXIV Corps from the Army of the James, should begin an artillery barrage on the Confederate lines. The corps commanders and Ord reported their men could not see well enough to attack. At 10:00p.m., Union artillery opened fire on the Confederate lines opposite the Petersburg lines until 2:00a.m. The Confederates did not leave the lines and the Union assault began at about4:40a.m.|$|E

25|$|Brian's advisor, Maelsuthain O'Carroll, {{documented}} in the 'Book of Armagh' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries <b>should</b> <b>send</b> the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King.

The Athenians, he said, feared nothing more than the occupation of Decelea. The Spartans took this advice into consideration, and appointed Gylippus to command their fleet.|$|E

Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu to escort the supplies to Wuchao (烏巢; in present-day Yanjin County, Henan), a place 40 li away from Guandu near Gushi, and placed him in charge of guarding the supplies there. Yuan Shao's advisor Ju Shou argued that Wuchao, being their important supply depot, was too lightly guarded and insisted that Yuan Shao <b>should</b> <b>send</b> the general Jiang Qi (蔣奇) {{to serve as a}} perimeter guard to Chunyu Qiong and cut off any potential raids.

25|$|The {{news about}} the siege of Tiberias caused a new {{conflict}} among the crusaders, because Raymond and Ridefort proposed adverse strategies. Emphasizing that the town could resist even a prolonged siege, Raymond wanted to avoid a pinched battle. He also proposed that Guy <b>should</b> <b>send</b> envoys to Antioch and ask Bohemond III to send reinforcements. Hearing Raymond’s proposal, Ridefort and Châtillon accused him of cowardice, adding that passivity would cost the king his kingdom. Since the king was obviously willing to accept Raymond's proposal, Ridefort reminded him Raymond's previous alliance with Saladin. Finally, the king decided to attack and ordered his army to march towards Tiberias.|$|E
25|$|The {{repeated}} rejections by the British of Greek Cypriot {{demands for}} enosis prompted an armed underground campaign by {{a movement of}} Greek Cypriots known as the National Organization of Cypriot Struggle, or EOKA. EOKA, led by the Greek commander George Grivas, systematically targeted British colonial authorities. One {{of the effects of}} the EOKA campaign was to alter the Turkish position from demanding full reincorporation into Turkey to a demand for taksim (partition). The fact that the Turks were a minority was, according to Nihat Erim, to be addressed by the transfer of thousands of Turks from mainland Turkey so that the Greek Cypriots would cease to be the majority. When Erim visited Cyprus as the Turkish representative, he was advised by the then British Governor John Harding that Turkey <b>should</b> <b>send</b> educated Turks to settle in Cyprus.|$|E
