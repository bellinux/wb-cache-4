40|$|Experts in {{the oyster}} supply chain (farmers, retailers, and gourmet chefs) in The Netherlands have {{suggested}} that the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) has superior sensory qualities compared to the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas). However, scientific evidence is lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate consumer preferences for these two oyster species and to determine the sensory properties of both species by consumers. Two-alternative forced choice tests were performed with the oysters involving a panel of 74 naïve consumers. No significant differences in preferences between the oyster species were observed by the consumers. Nine sensory attributes of both oyster species were evaluated. Consumers did not observe significant differences between species in the sensory attributes: overall odor intensity, sea odor, mud odor, sweetness, pungency, and firmness. The Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> was perceived as significantly saltier and more intense in greenness than the European flat oyster. We concluded that only a few sensory properties of the European flat oyster and the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> are perceived as being different by untrained consumers. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two important different geographical cultivation areas in the Netherlands (Eastern Scheldt and Lake Grevelingen) on the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) and Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas). Market size oysters were analyzed for biochemical composition (dry matter, ash, protein, lipid content and fatty acid profile) and VOCs from samples harvested in January and February. Significant differences in fatty acids and in VOC content were observed between the oyster species. The European flat oyster was found to have a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in comparison with Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters.</b> The main VOC in the European flat oyster was found to be 3 -cyclohexene- 1 -ethanol while 1, 5 -octadien- 3 -ol was the main VOC in the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster.</b> Principle component analysis (PCA) not only showed separation between oyster species, but also between oysters originating from different cultivation areas as well as oysters harvested at different time intervals. </p...|$|R
