40|$|In the United States, {{the built}} {{environment}} is responsible for nearly 37 percent of the nation’s total energy consumption and around 70 percent of its electricity use. Residential buildings account for almost 21 percent of GHGs emitted in the U. S. Approximately 30 percent of homes in the U. S. are rental units and over 98 million U. S. residents are renters. This number {{is expected to increase}} by 360, 000 – 470, 000 annually between 2010 and 2020. Therefore, successful strategies for reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions must address energy efficiency in the residential sector, including rental housing. In addition to environmental implications, residential energy inefficiency is an economic issue. Home energy costs have been rising over the last several decades. Because energy represents a significant portion of housing-related expenses, efficiency stands to play a large role in the future of housing costs for individuals and communities. 	In the rental housing market, the <b>split</b> <b>incentive</b> problem is often described as a barrier to more energy efficient units. Landlords must pay the upfront cost for efficiency upgrades while tenants benefit in the form of reduced utility costs. However, in recognition of this benefit, tenants may be willing to pay a premium for their rent. If tenants are willing to pay significantly higher costs for more efficient housing, incentives are not truly split. Rather, landlords and developers lack full information about their return on investment for improved energy efficiency. Conversely, if tenants are not willing to pay a premium for improved levels of energy efficiency, additional strategies will likely be needed to address the <b>split</b> <b>incentive</b> problem and reduce this market failure. Hedonic regression results using a sample of 692, 846 households participating in the 2010 American Community Survey suggest that households in the U. S. rental market are not willing to pay a premium for improved energy efficiency. Therefore, the <b>split</b> <b>incentive</b> problem represents an important barrier to overcome in order to improve energy efficiency in rental housing. Additionally, results suggest that there is variation in the value tenants place on efficiency for different segments of the rental market. Households living in larger rental units are willing to pay significantly more for improved energy efficiency than residents of smaller units. As a result of variation in household willingness to pay, improving efficiency in rental housing may require different approaches for different market segments. Developing effective solutions that reduce supply side and demand side barriers to improved energy efficiency will help to align incentives and regulate behavior to provide tenants with more energy efficient rental housing.

The results show that one third of the studied mills and about two fifths of the studied foundries do not allocate energy costs by means of sub-metering, which probably contributes to reinforce the <b>split</b> <b>incentive</b> problem. Moreover, about one fifth of the mills and about half of the foundries lack a long-term energy strategy. The results also show that only about 40 % and 25 % respectively of the studied mills and foundries may be categorized as successful when it comes to energy management practices. If energy management is not fully prioritized even in energy-intensive industries - such as the studied foundry and pulp- and paper industry it will, in all probability, not be prioritized in less energy-intensive industrial sectors or countries either, indicating a large untapped potential in regard to cleaner, more environmentally sound, production in the industrial sector.

Colocation data centers (simply called colocation) are recognized as a notably promising resource for demand response due to their high power demand and remarkable potential in demand management. A major challenge of colocation demand {{response is}} the <b>split</b> <b>incentive,</b> that is, colocation operators desire demand response for financial compensation while tenants may not embrace demand response {{due to lack of}} incentives. To address this challenge, we study a hierarchical demand response scheme, where tenants within a colocation respond to the colocation operator while the operator interacts with the electric power company. We propose that twolevel marketing is suitable to this hierarchical scheme, and design a new market mechanism that results in a win-win situation for the operator and tenants. Specially, tenants who chooses to reduce power demand obtain financial rewards from the operator, while the operator receives financial compensation from the electric power company due to its tenants&# 39; demand reduction. An appealing feature of the mechanism is that it provably converges to a unique equilibrium solution. At the equilibrium, neither the operator or tenants can improve their individual economic performance by changing their own strategies.

40|$|Improving {{building}} {{energy efficiency}} is {{widely recognized as}} one of the best strategies for combating climate change and other energy problems. Energy efficiency implementation has been slow, however, due to a number of practical barriers, and few building sectors face higher hurdles to energy efficiency than rental housing. In this thesis I ask: What are the major barriers to investment in energy efficiency for rental housing? How well do existing policies and programs address these barriers? And finally, which strategies are best suited to overcome the barriers that face rental housing efficiency? I describe several barriers, from <b>split</b> <b>incentives</b> to transaction costs, that limit energy efficiency for rental housing. Existing policies and efficiency programs do not adequately address most of these barriers. While there is no silver bullet solution to facilitate energy efficiency for rental housing, I identify a variety of policy options that can be implemented at the federal, state, and local levels. One measure in particular, a "green lease," holds great promise for overcoming <b>split</b> <b>incentives</b> and other obstacles. A combination of voluntary and regulatory measures will be necessary to deeply penetrate the rental housing efficiency market. Finally, I argue that policy packages must be tailored to the conditions of local rental housing markets, and local energy initiatives hold great promise as part of the solution. by Beth E. Williams.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been growing global {{recognition}} {{of the need to}} reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change concerns. It is generally acknowledged that the energy efficiency of existing homes can be improved, but there are significant barriers to its uptake. In particular, improving the energy efficiency of private rental housing presents unique policy challenges due to a split-incentive problem. This has prompted some governments to introduce programmes that encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. While landlords are responsible for the purchase of many energy-consuming household appliances, tenants are responsible for energy bills. Since the landlord does not reap the immediate benefits of investment in energy-efficient equipment, the incentives motivating such investment are weaker than for homeowners. This paper aims to quantify the magnitude of the split-incentive problem in the Australian private rental housing market by invoking a modelling approach where energy expenditure is estimated as a function of housing tenure, dwelling type, location, climate and other socio-demographic variables. We find no evidence in support of the split-incentive hypothesis in Australia.

As an answer, this article demonstrates that the impediments to renewable power are socio-technical, a term that encompasses the technological, social, political, regulatory, and cultural aspects of electricity supply and use. Extensive interviews of public utility commissioners, utility managers, system operators, manufacturers, researchers, business owners, and ordinary consumers reveal that it is these socio-technical barriers that often explain why wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydroelectric power sources are not embraced. Utility operators reject renewable resources because they are trained to think {{only in terms of}} big, conventional power plants. Consumers practically ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as <b>split</b> <b>incentives)</b> prevent consumers from becoming fully invested in their electricity choices.

Using information from secondary literature and interviews, it identifies the businesses offering energy service contracts, the sectors and organisations that are purchasing those contracts, the types of contract that are available, the areas of market growth and the reasons for that growth. The paper finds that the UK market is relatively large, highly diverse, concentrated in particular sectors and types of site and overwhelmingly focused upon established technologies with high rates of return. A major driver is the emergence of procurement frameworks for energy service contracts in the public sector.
