40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{attempts to}} explain the scaling effect on microstructure and creep of Sn-based solders. It compares creep data that was gained on bulky samples and on small solder joints. The microstructural properties of the bulk specimens and real solder joints were examined using metallographic sectioning, optical microscopy techniques, and SEM-microprobe analysis. The results of the microstructural analysis {{were related to the}} investigated mechanical properties of the solders. The solidification behaviour of SnAg- and SnAgCu was investigated experimentally. Microstructural analysis point out that bulk solder has typically a dendritic microstructure. At ultra small solder joints complex forms of solidification behaviour were detected. The different nucleation behaviour {{is supposed to be the}} reason for the differences in solidification. Creep experiments on <b>SnAgCu-based</b> <b>solders</b> have been conducted on several types of specimens: flip chip and bulk specimens. The re sults of the experiments show that the influence of size and composition of <b>SnAgCu-based</b> <b>solders</b> is very complex. Size and composition are no independent factors...|$|E
40|$|A <b>SnAgCu-based</b> <b>solder</b> stripe {{between two}} Cu {{electrodes}} is current stressed with a density of 59104 A/cm 2 at 393 K (120 C). After current stressing for 24 hours, electromigration induces the Cu dissolution from the cathode-side Cu electrode, {{leading to the}} Cu 6 Sn 5 formation in the solder stripe. Very interestingly, the Cu 6 Sn 5 phase is selectively formed within a specific Sn grain. Electron backscattering diffraction analysis indicates the crystallographic orientations of Sn grains {{play an important role}} in the selective Cu 6 Sn 5 formation...|$|R
40|$|Interposers with through-silicon vias (TSVs) play a {{key role}} in the {{three-dimensional}} integration and packaging of integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems. In the current practice of fabricating interposers, solder balls are placed next to the vias; however, this approach requires a large foot print for the input/output (I/O) connections. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the possibility of placing the solder balls directly on top of the vias, thereby enabling a smaller pitch between the solder balls and an increased density of the I/O connections. To reach this goal, inkjet printing (that is, piezo and super inkjet) was used to successfully fill and planarize hollow metal TSVs with a dielectric polymer. The under bump metallization (UBM) pads were also successfully printed with inkjet technology on top of the polymer-filled vias, using either Ag or Au inks. The reliability of the TSV interposers was investigated by a temperature cycling stress test (- 40 °C to + 125 °C). The stress test showed no impact on DC resistance of the TSVs; however, shrinkage and delamination of the polymer was observed, along with some micro-cracks in the UBM pads. For proof of concept, <b>SnAgCu-based</b> <b>solder</b> balls were jetted on the UBM pads. QC 20170510 </p...|$|R
