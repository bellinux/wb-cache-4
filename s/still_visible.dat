5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems caused them to become obsolete. Today, the ruins of coastal fortifications are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> at Labrador Battery, Mount Faber, Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting reminder of their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> along the shore at low tide.|$|E

5|$|Captain Warburton-Lee {{was brought}} ashore but died {{after an hour}} from his head wounds. 139 other men managed to get ashore, {{although}} 26 were seriously wounded. Captain Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Hardy was lifted off the beach at high tide and drifted {{to the head of}} Skjomen fjord where she capsized in shallow waters. The wreck was <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> as late as 1963.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} debris from {{the collapse of the}} arch. The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> where they were found, at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E
5|$|The Galveston Bay Area {{is located}} on the gulf coastal plain, and its {{vegetation}} is classified as temperate grassland and marshes. The municipalities have been built on reclaimed marshes, swamps, and prairies, which are all <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> in undeveloped areas.Eubanks (2006), p. 10.|$|E

5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of the pyramid <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> today.|$|E
5|$|The ditch is <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> {{in short}} sections, {{such as a}} 330-yard stretch in Denton Golf Course. In the parts which survive, the ditch is 4–5yards wide and up to 5feet deep. Part of the {{earthwork}} is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained a transit room. Each of the rooms had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier; the piers are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> in the basement below the transit rooms. The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently.|$|E

5|$|The {{platform}} bay at Paddock Wood {{from which}} most of the line's trains departed is now part of a car park, with the edge of the platform fenced off. Parts of the line are <b>still</b> <b>visible,</b> such as the embankment through Swig's Hole valley and the approach to Horsmonden tunnel. Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} {{that there was a}} very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are <b>still</b> <b>visible.</b> Some parts of the canal can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only about}} half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of {{prominent}} public buildings are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.|$|E

5|$|At Omaha Beach, {{parts of}} the Mulberry harbour are <b>still</b> <b>visible,</b> {{and a few of}} the beach {{obstacles}} remain. A memorial to the American National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> {{on each side of}} the surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside the walls and to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} fitted with three {{temporary}} masts for their delivery voyages, although only Cerberus had her freeboard raised {{with the addition}} of temporary bulwarks. The ships spent the bulk of their service lives in reserve and rarely, if ever, left their home port. Magdala was sold in January 1903, but Cerberus was hulked in 1900 and transferred to the Royal Australian Navy when it was formed in 1911. She was renamed HMAS Platypus II in 1918 and sold in 1924. Stripped of all salvageable material, she was scuttled in 1926 as a breakwater, and her remains are <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> today.|$|E

5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, {{a segment of the}} ditch 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is <b>still</b> <b>visible</b> directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
