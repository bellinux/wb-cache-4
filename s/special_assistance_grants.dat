Children temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or children, who cannot be left in such environment, {{are entitled to a}} <b>special</b> protection and <b>assistance</b> <b>granted</b> by the state in one of alternative care forms. The Czech Republic is criticized for a long time by the international organizations because of numbers of children placed in any type of institutional care. Consequently, the amendment of the Act N. 359 / 1999 Coll., on social and legal protection of children, has been approved in June 2006. This amendment has established a new legal institute called "the foster care for a temporary period". The function of this institute is to avoid a placement of children to an institutional care in the case, when the children can not stay in the original family because of whatever reason however there is a presumption of re-entry to that original family. Parents still have their parental responsibilities and still have right {{to keep in touch with}} their child. The thesis is composed of six chapters, which are subdivided into subchapters. Chapter One deals with the historical development of foster care. Chapter Two [...] ...|$|R

In it he announced the {{most significant}} development in remedial education in Victoria with a strategic plan for addressing a reported decline in literacy and numeracy skills amongst secondary students. The totally new component of the <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Program was the provision of 1000 <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Resource Teachers [...] "in the delivery of services to children with special needs." [...] They were given [...] "a major on-site responsibility facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers."https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up The program involved the training of these primary teachers as <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Resource Teachers and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up Lacy's greatest political disappointment came from the Cain Labour Government's actions after their 1982 election directed at de-emphasising and largely dismantling this educationally highly significant and ground breaking program.|$|R
