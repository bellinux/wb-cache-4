50|$|A {{nanoprobe}} in {{the real}} world, as opposed to fiction, is an optical device. It was developed by tapering an optical fiber to a tip measuring 100 nm = 1000 angstroms wide. Also, a very thin coating of silver nanoparticles helps to enhance the Raman <b>scattering</b> <b>effect</b> of the light. (The phenomenon of light reflection from an object when illuminated by a laser light {{is referred to as}} Raman scattering.) The reflected light demonstrates vibration energies unique to each object (samples in this case), which can be characterised and identified. The silver nanoparticles in this technique provides for the rapid oscillations of electrons, adding to vibration energies, and thus enhancing Raman Scattering—commonly known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). These SERS nanoprobes produce higher electromagnetic fields enabling higher signal output—eventually resulting in accurate detection and analysis of samples.|$|E

50|$|The reason can be {{understood}} easily if we can see conduction in metals as a typical classical phenomenon with quantum effects all embedded into an effective mass that can be computed quantum mechanically as also happens to resistance {{that can be seen}} as a <b>scattering</b> <b>effect</b> of conduction electrons. When the temperature is lowered and the dimensions of the device are meaningfully reduced, this classical behavior should disappear and the laws of quantum mechanics should govern the behavior of conducting electrons seen as waves that ballistically move inside the conductor without any kind of dissipation. Most of the time this is what one observes. But it appeared as a surprise to uncover that the so-called dephasing time, that is the time it takes for the conducting electrons to lose their quantum behavior, becomes finite rather than infinite when the temperature approaches zero in mesoscopic devices violating the expectations of the theory of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii (see citation below). This kind of saturation of the dephasing time at low temperatures is an open problem even as several proposals have been put forward.|$|E

5000|$|Inselbergs {{are quite}} common in Angola {{extending}} into Namibia, Zimbabwe, and western Madagascar. Inselbergs {{have been demonstrated}} to support a plant community dramatically different from their surroundings (Rapanarivo,1999a). What {{little is known about}} seed dispersal of Pachypodium supports a <b>scattering</b> <b>effect</b> confined to sets of outcrops and inselberg landscapes. Pachypodium seed dispersal is carried out by wind, suggesting the scattering target as outcrops and inselbergs. Yet, according to Rapanarivo et al., this type of dispersal might not be the best method for the genus. The Rapanarivo study suggested, instead, that seedlings tended to emerge around [...] "mother" [...] plants that presumably have been well-established, rather than on distant outcrops or inselbergs. Evidence for this conclusion is found in the occurrence of P. densiflorum from Kandreho to Zazafotsy where seeds have dropped in between inselbergs and outcrops. Other examples include P. eburneum, P. windsorii, P. inopinatum, and P. decaryi where in all cases seed distribution is restricted; because the wind does not always carry seeds very far from the host plant.|$|E

50|$|Current {{research}} {{is focused on}} modelling how the effect is generated by the intracluster plasma in galaxy clusters, and on using the effect to estimate the Hubble constant and to separate different components in the angular average statistics of fluctuations in the background. Hydrodynamic structure formation simulations are being studied to gain data on thermal and kinetic effects in the theory. Observations are difficult due to the small amplitude of the effect and to confusion with experimental error and other sources of CMB temperature fluctuations. However, since the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is a <b>scattering</b> <b>effect,</b> its magnitude is independent of redshift. This is very important: it means that clusters at high redshift can be detected just as easily as those at low redshift. Another factor which facilitates high-redshift cluster detection is the angular scale versus redshift relation: it changes little between redshifts of 0.3 and 2, meaning that clusters between these redshifts have similar sizes on the sky. The use of surveys of clusters detected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for the determination of cosmological parameters has been demonstrated by Barbosa et al. (1996). This might help in understanding the dynamics of dark energy in forthcoming surveys (SPT, ACT, Planck).|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the figure of merit (zT), a material’s thermal conductivity should be minimized while its electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient is maximized. In most cases, methods to increase or decrease one property result in {{the same effect on}} other properties due to their interdependence. [...] A novel processing technique exploits the scattering of different phonon frequencies to selectively reduce lattice thermal conductivity without the typical negative effects on electrical conductivity from the simultaneous increased scattering of electrons. In a bismuth antimony tellurium ternary system, liquid-phase sintering is used to produce low-energy semicoherent grain boundaries, which do not have a significant <b>scattering</b> <b>effect</b> on electrons. The breakthrough is then applying a pressure to the liquid in the sintering process, which creates a transient flow of the Te rich liquid and facilitates the formation of dislocations that greatly reduce the lattice conductivity. The ability to selectively decrease the lattice conductivity results in reported zT values of 1.86 ± [...]15 which are a significant improvement over current commercial thermoelectric generators which have typical figures of merit closer to [...]3-.6. These improvements highlight the fact that in addition to development of novel materials for thermoelectric applications, using different processing techniques to design microstructure is a viable and worthwhile effort.
