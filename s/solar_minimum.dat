5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical <b>solar</b> <b>minimum,</b> few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E

50|$|Early {{research}} {{attempted to}} correlate weather with limited success, followed by attempts to correlate solar activity with global temperature. The cycle also impacts regional climate. Measurements from the SORCE's Spectral Irradiance Monitor show that solar UV variability produces, for example, colder winters in the U.S. and northern Europe and warmer winters in Canada and southern Europe during <b>solar</b> <b>minima.</b>|$|R
25|$|Even {{in times}} of <b>solar</b> <b>minimum,</b> when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long {{distance}} possibilities. Sporadic E propagation can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late {{spring and early summer}} being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during <b>solar</b> <b>minimum,</b> F2 openings often occur on transequatorial paths, for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.|$|E

Many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse, with many or all effects visible, and a very nice corona, despite the proximity to the <b>solar</b> <b>minimum.</b> The partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the International Space Station, where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moon's shadow on Earth's surface. It initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of March would bring the ISS into the path of totality, but this correction was postponed.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{sediment}} record from a small lake within the subarctic wetland complex Stordalen in northernmost Sweden covering the last 1000 years. Variations {{in the content of}} minerogenic material are found to follow reconstructed variations in the activity of the Sun between the 13 th and 18 th centuries. Periods of low solar activity are associated with minima in minerogenic material and vice versa. A comparison between the sunspot cycle and a long instrumental series of summer precipitation further reveals a link between the 11 yr solar cycle and summer precipitation variability since around 1960. <b>Solar</b> <b>minima</b> are in this period associated with minima in summer precipitation, whereas the amount of summer precipitation increases during periods with higher solar activity. Our results suggest that the climate responds to both the 11 yr solar cycle and to long-term changes in solar activity and in particular <b>solar</b> <b>minima,</b> causing dry conditions with resulting decreased runoff...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of global gridded precipitation and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data after 1978 makes possible {{an investigation of}} the influence of the decadal solar oscillation in the tropics during three solar maxima and two <b>solar</b> <b>minima.</b> The NCEP/NCAR reanalyses starting in the 1950 s allows the inclusion of an additional two <b>solar</b> maxima and <b>minima</b> to look for consistency of response across a longer time period. In the northern summer (July–August), the major climatological tropical precipitation maxima are intensified in solar maxima compared to <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> during the period 1979 – 2002. The regions of this enhanced climatological precipitation extend from the Indian monsoon to the West Pacific oceanic warm pool and farther eastwards in the Intertropical Convergence Zone of the North Pacific and North American Monsoon, to the tropical Atlantic and greater rainfall over the Sahel and central Africa. The differences between <b>solar</b> maxima and <b>minima</b> in the zonal mean temperature through the depth of the troposphere, OLR, tropospheric vertical motion, and tropopause temperature are consistent with the differences in the rainfall. The upward vertical motion is stronger in regions of enhanced tropical precipitation, tropospheric temperatures are higher, tropopause temperatures are lower, and the OLR is reduced due to higher, colder cloud tops over the areas of deeper convective rainfall in the solar maxima than in the minima. These differences between the extremes of the solar cycle suggest that an increase in solar forcing intensifies the Hadley and Walker circulations, wit...|$|R
50|$|Coronal mass ejections {{are often}} {{associated}} with other forms of solar activity, but a broadly accepted theoretical understanding of these relationships has not been established. CMEs most often originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares. Near solar maxima, the Sun produces about three CMEs every day, whereas near <b>solar</b> <b>minima,</b> there is about one CME every five days.|$|R
25|$|The corona is {{not always}} evenly {{distributed}} {{across the surface of}} the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the equatorial regions, with coronal holes covering the polar regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with sunspot activity. The solar cycle spans approximately 11 years, from <b>solar</b> <b>minimum</b> to the following minimum. Since the solar magnetic field is continually wound up due to the faster rotation of mass at the sun's equator (differential rotation), sunspot activity will be more pronounced at solar maximum where the magnetic field is more twisted. Associated with sunspots are coronal loops, loops of magnetic flux, upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter photosphere aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the relatively dark sun spots.|$|E
2500|$|Sunspot {{activity}} cycles {{are about}} every eleven years, with some variation in length. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations rise quickly and then fall more slowly. [...] The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle {{is known as}} solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as <b>solar</b> <b>minimum.</b> [...] This period is also observed in most other solar activity and is linked to {{a variation in the}} solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fluence of}} charged {{particles}} hitting {{the brain of}} an astronaut has been estimated {{several times in the}} past. One estimate is that during a 3-year mission to Mars at <b>solar</b> <b>minimum</b> (assuming the 1972 spectrum of GCR), 20 million out of 43 million hippocampus cells and 230 thousand out of 1.3 million thalamus cell nuclei will be directly hit by one or more particles with charge Z> 15. These numbers do not include the additional cell hits by energetic electrons (delta rays) that are produced along the track of HZE nuclei [...] or correlated cellular damage. The contributions of delta rays from GCR and correlated cellular damage increase the number of damaged cells two- to three-fold from estimates of the primary track alone and present the possibility of heterogeneously damaged regions, respectively. The importance of such additional damage is poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|A coronal mass {{ejection}} (CME) is {{a massive}} burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona. Near solar maxima, the Sun produces about three CMEs every day, whereas <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> feature about one every five days. CMEs, along with solar flares of other origin, can disrupt radio transmissions and damage satellites and electrical transmission line facilities, resulting in potentially massive and long-lasting power outages.|$|R
50|$|Orbital decay thus {{involves}} a positive feedback effect, where {{the more the}} orbit decays, the lower its altitude drops, and the lower the altitude, the faster the decay. Decay is also particularly sensitive to external factors of the space environment such as solar activity, which are not very predictable. During solar maxima the Earth's atmosphere causes significant drag up to a hundred kilometers higher than during <b>solar</b> <b>minima.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 15 meter band is {{considered}} a DX band (i.e., used for long-distance communications). Since signals on 15 meters propagate primarily via reflection off of the F-2 layer of the ionosphere, the band is most useful for intercontinental communication during daylight hours, especially in years close to the solar maximum. However, the band also sees long-distance openings during <b>solar</b> <b>minima,</b> and into evening hours, and does not require high-power station equipment to make contacts even at these times.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of ground-based observations of solar irradiance was recently published in this journal, reporting an apparent increase of solar irradiance {{on the ground}} {{of the order of}} 1 % between <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> and maxima [1]. Since the corresponding variations in total solar irradiance on top of the atmosphere are accurately determined from satellite observations to be of the order of 0. 1 % only [2], the one order of magnitude stronger effect in the terrestrial insolation data was interpreted as evidence for cosmic-ray induced aerosol formation in the atmosphere. In my opinion, however, this result does not reflect reality. Using the energy budget of Earth's surface, I show that changes of ground-based insolation with the solar cycle of the order of 1 % between <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> and maxima would result in large surface air temperature variations which are inconsistent with the instrumental record. It would appear that the strong variations of terrestrial irradiance found by [1] are due to the uncorrected effects of volcanic or local aerosols and seasonal variations. Taking these effects into account, I find a variation of terrestrial insolation with solar activity which is of the same order as the one measured from space, bringing the surface energy budget into agreement with the solar signal detected in temperature data...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{difference}} between the most two recent <b>solar</b> <b>minima,</b> we analyze the in-situ ACE and ULYSSES observations and examine the distributions of the three types of solar wind (streamer-stalk-associated wind, wind from outside the streamer stalk that can be associated, in part, with coronal holes, and interplanetary coronal mass ejections). We use the taxonomy provided by Zhao et al. (2009) to identify the three types of solar wind. We then map the in-situ observations to the 2. 5 solar radii surface. With the aid of the potential-field-source surface model (PFSS), we calculate the normal distance from the solar wind "foot point" to the local helisopheric current sheet on that surface. We find that the source region of the streamer stalk wind is narrower compared to the previous minimum. The area outside the streamer stalk is accordingly larger, but the magnetic field strength is observed to be lower, with the result that the total amount of the magnetic open flux from the outside of streamer stalk region is conserved in the two successive <b>solar</b> <b>minima.</b> The implications of the conservation of open magnetic flux for models of the behavior of the solar magnetic field are discussed.

40|$|International audienceAims. This study aims {{to improve}} our {{understanding}} of the occurrence and origin of grand <b>solar</b> maxima and <b>minima.</b> Methods. We first investigate the statistics of peaks and dips simultaneously occurring in the solar modulation potentials reconstructed using the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) 10 Be and IntCal 13 14 C records for the overlapping time period spanning between ~ 1650 AD to 6600 BC. Based on the distribution of these events, we propose a method to identify grand minima and maxima periods. By using waiting time distribution analysis, we investigate the nature of grand minima and maxima periods identified based on the criteria as well as the variance and significance of the Hale cycle during these kinds of events throughout the Holocene epoch. Results. Analysis of grand minima and maxima events occurring simultaneously in the solar modulation potentials, reconstructed based on the 14 C and the 10 Be records, shows that the majority of events characterized by periods of moderate activity levels tend to last less than 50 years: grand maxima periods do not last longer than 100 years, while grand minima can persist slightly longer. The power and the variance of the 22 -year Hale cycle increases during grand maxima and decreases during grand minima, compared to periods characterized by moderate activity levels. Conclusions. We present the first reconstruction of the occurrence of grand <b>solar</b> maxima and <b>minima</b> during the Holocene based on simultaneous changes in records of past solar variability derived from tree-ring 14 C and ice-core 10 Be, respectively. This robust determination of the occurrence of grand <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> and maxima periods will enable systematic investigations of the influence of grand <b>solar</b> <b>minima</b> and maxima episodes on Earth’s climate...|$|R
