40|$|Most {{nutritional}} {{studies with}} seaweed meals or seaweed extracts have investigated low dietary inclusion rates (less than 10 %) {{to establish their}} possible usefulness as functional (binder effect), nutritional, and nutraceutical (health protective effect) supplements in shrimp feeds. The optimum inclusion level varies depending on algae or consumer species. In many instances, the inclusion of algae in feed formulations has resulted in improved pellet quality (water stability, water holding capacity and texture), higher feed intake, improved feed efficiency, better growth performance and higher animal product quality (higher pigmentation, lower cholesterol content). Additionally, macroalgae contain some active compounds that can improve animal resistance against bacterial and virus diseases. Some seaweed species can be co-cultivated with shrimps, resulting in a sustainable alternative to {{reduce the need for}} artificial feed.

The batch tests showed that the low-cost materials demonstrated high adsorption capacities and affinities to Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn, but were slightly outperformed by the CER. Metal removal by each media was far superior to that reported for other types of low cost materials. Fixed beds of each media reduced concentrations of the target metals in a synthetic drainage water solution to levels below reference values measured at a case study site. This result suggests that any of the materials tested have the potential to completely remove impacts of a point source of metal contamination on the local water regime at the site.

40|$|Different {{aquaculture}} {{species such as}} finfishes and bivalves {{have been reported to}} control the luminous bacterial disease of shrimp, usually caused by Vibrio harveyi. The use of <b>seaweeds</b> in <b>shrimp</b> culture system has reportedly improved water quality and reduced the bacterial count. This study evaluated the potentials of two species of seaweeds, Gracilaria heteroclada (Ad Xia) and Kappaphycus striatum (Schnitz), to control the growth of V. harveyi. V. harveyi was inoculated into control tanks containing shrimps only and into treated tanks containing both shrimp and macroalgae. Luminous bacterial counts were monitored daily. From day 2 to day 6, luminous bacterial count in tanks with G. heteroclada was significantly lower than those in tanks with K. striatum. Bacteria isolated from the rearing water containing K. striatum and G. heteroclada and from the seaweed homogenized in sterile seawater showed anti-Vibrio harveyi activity. The seaweed homogenate per se also showed anti-luminous bacterial property. Presence of both G. heteroclada and K. striatum in shrimp culture system has the potential to control the growth of luminous bacteria. G. heteroclada was more efficient and sustainable, as shown by the lower luminous bacterial count and the higher percentage recovery of this macroalga after 11 d in experimental tanks...|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture or {{fish farming}} {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the Philippines contributing significantly to food security, livelihood and the economy. The major commodities produced are <b>seaweeds,</b> milkfish, tilapia, <b>shrimp,</b> oysters and mussels in extensive, semi-intensive and intensive culture systems in ponds, pens, cages and open coastal waters. Eco-friendly fish farm management is applied in brackishwater ponds for the culture of milkfish and shrimp. The negative impacts of intensive shrimp farming brought about by diseases due to “self-pollution ” have been success-fully addressed with technological innovations. Good management practices are needed to re-duce the losses in freshwater and marine cages and pens attributed to heavy organic loading of open waters that result in massive fish kills. Ecological enhancement of production systems has been achieved with genetic improvement of species, disease prevention, and use of substi-tutes for “trash fish. ” International, regional and national guidelines for responsible aquaculture through Codes of Conduct and Fisheries Administrative Orders are in effect {{in the country to}} ensure the quality and safety of aquaculture foods and other products...|$|R
50|$|Aquaculture {{started to}} take off in Madagascar in the 1980s. The {{majority}} of Aquaculture in Madagascar includes the cultivation of sea cucumbers, <b>seaweed,</b> fish and <b>shrimp.</b> Aquaculture in Madagascar {{is being used to}} stimulate the countries economy, increase the wages of fishermen and women in the area and improve the regions ocean water quality. Coastal regions of Madagascar are reliant on the Indian Oceans marine resources as a source of food, income, and cultural identity. Madagascar is the fourth-largest island in the world and consists of the main island, as well as smaller surrounding islands. Madagascar {{is considered to be a}} biodiversity hotspot. Over 90 percent of its wildlife is not found anywhere else on Earth. In the Velondriake, a locally managed marine area (LMMA) in southwest Madagascar, laws have been created by an official governing body, consisting of elected representatives from 25 villages, called ‘dina’, to combat environmental degradation. This LMMA includes coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, baobab forests and other threatened habitats. The Vezo, literally meaning ‘people who fish’ in the Malagasy language of the region, are amongst Madagascar's poorest. Making environmentally conscious efforts to boost the economy and raise incomes are top priorities for the LMMA.|$|R
30|$|High {{values of}} biomass and growth rates are {{desirable}} {{in an integrated}} aquaculture application. In this study, the growth rate decreased for the three color strains {{at the end of}} the experiment. Environmental factors, such as nutrients, water motion, and turbidity, are known to affect the growth of <b>seaweed</b> negatively in <b>shrimp</b> ponds (Marinho-Soriano et al. 2002). However, no changes in water transparency (20  cm) or water motion were observed throughout the study. Besides that, the RGR of all strains showed a positive correlation with NH 4 + indicating no limitation by nitrogen. A possible explanation for the biomass loss and reduction of growth rate observed {{at the end of the}} experiment is the long exposure of seaweed to atmospheric conditions and its desiccation during the water exchange of the ponds. During this period, there was a failure in the farm’s pumping system, which caused a drastic reduction in the volume of water in the pond and the exposure of seaweeds to sunlight for several hours. The effects of sun exposure and dehydration during the emersion could have caused physiological stress and subsequent biomass loss (70 %). Indeed, aerial exposure results in energetic cost and reduces available resources for growth, such as nitrogen and inorganic carbon (Lobban and Harrison 1997).|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the nutritional composition of the intertidal marine polychaete Perinereis helleri (Nereididae) when artificially cultured in sand filters treating mariculture wastewater. Moisture levels in harvested P. helleri ranged from 758 to 855 g kg 1, and ash, from 23 to 61 g kg 1 wet matter (WM). Stocking density and graded size after harvest significantly affected their composition. Higher total lipid contents were found in large (> 0. 6 g) P. helleri(16 – 19 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the lowest density(1000 m 2 : 18 g kg 1 WM) than in small (≤ 0. 6 g) ones (14 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the highest densities (4000 – 6000 m 2 : 13 – 16 g kg 1 WM). Several fatty acids within a very broad profile (some 30 identified) reflected this pattern, yet their ARA/EPA/DHA ratios were relatively unaffected. Feeding the polychaete-assisted sand filters (PASF) with fish meal to increase worm biomass productivity significantly increased their DHA content. Other components (e. g. protein, phospholipids, cholesterol, carbohydrate, amino acids, nitrogen, minerals and bromophenols) and nutritional factors (e. g. maturity, feeding <b>seaweed</b> and endemic <b>shrimp</b> viral content) were also investigated. Results suggest that PASF-produced P. helleri have a well-balanced nutritional profile for penaeid shrimp and fish broodstock...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{two types of}} {{integrated}} aquaculture systems used in Yingbin Bay, Hainan Province, China: a shrimp (intensive) and abalone system, and a <b>shrimp</b> (semi-intensive), <b>seaweed</b> and duck system. The specific goals {{of the study were}} to 1) evaluate water and sediment quality in ponds for these two integrated farming systems; 2) determine common farming methods in the region through interviews with farmers; and 3) evaluate effects of integrated culture on water quality in Yingbin Bay. In order to accomplish these goals, a combination of on-site water and soil quality analysis, as well as interviews with twenty-two farmers, were conducted from March to June 2006. The two integrated systems varied greatly in their design and management. The shrimp and abalone system was comprised of three intensive shrimp ponds that were fed by abalone effluent and groundwater. The <b>shrimp,</b> <b>seaweed</b> and duck system was comprised of one semi-intensive shrimp pond and one seaweed and duck pond. The farmer used the seaweed and duck pond for biofiltration of his shrimp effluent, such that water was recirculated between the two ponds. Both integrated systems were able to maintain water quality adequate for shrimp growth. However, both systems failed to meet Global Aquaculture Alliance’s standards for total phosphorus and total suspended solids. The seaweed and duck pond was hypothesized to have lower nutrient concentrations relative to all of the shrimp ponds in the study due to seaweed’s ability to uptake nutrients, but nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations were much higher in the seaweed and duck pond than in the shrimp ponds. Other nutrient parameters in the duck and seaweed pond were found in concentrations similar to those in the intensive shrimp ponds. Total ammonia and phosphate concentrations decreased downstream through the Yingbin Bay culture area, implying that water quality improved on an upstream to downstream gradient. This {{may be the result of}} aquaculture activities utilizing nutrients flowing downstream. However, total phosphorus, and COD concentrations did not decrease (and in some cases increased). In particular, high total phosphorus concentrations were observed throughout the study ponds and bay in April (as high as 1. 70 mg/L); phosphate concentrations did not increase as dramatically, indicating that the phosphorus source was not inorganic fertilizer. According to the results of farmer interviews, farmer perceptions of water quality in the bay varied. Shrimp farmers believed that the bay had significant water quality problems, especially in terms of nutrients and disease. Seaweed farmers perceived no nutrient problems, but felt that physical water quality parameters, such as temperature and salinity, were not adequate for seaweed growth. Almost all farmers interviewed were interested in receiving help from universities and the government in order to develop better production systems. Given that farmers interviewed perceived problems with environmental quality in the bay and were interested in learning new and better management techniques, there are opportunities for researchers to work with Yingbin Bay farmers to adjust pond management techniques in order to increase productivity and improve water quality...|$|R
