40|$|The article {{presents}} results of {{study of the}} isotope composition and pollen spectra of atmospheric precipitation and ice taken from marginal parts of Korumdu Glacier (North-Chu Ridge, the Altai Mountains). The study was aimed at identification of sources and ways of precipitation into the nival-glacial region of Altai. Investigation of the isotope composition of ice taken from the tongue of the Korumdu Glacier and summer precipitation in its basin has shown that here the isotope concentrations are much smaller than similar ones of the cold Belukha Glacier. The last one is located near the Korumdu Glacier. This difference {{can be explained by}} the fact that main source of moisture forming layers of relatively warm Korumdu Glacier is precipitation of the cold season while accumulation on the cold Belukha Glacier proceeds during the whole year mainly due to the most heavy precipitation of warm (from March to November) season. Analysis of the isotope composition and the air mass trajectories on the day of July 16, 2013 allowed conclusion that the air masses started their way in the Baltic Sea region and moved mainly along middle latitudes. On this way they underwent insignificant isotope fractionation. Synoptic analysis had shown that the main reason of precipitation on the area under investigation was a front of occlusion over the Altai. In addition, results of palynological analysis of precipitation allow identification <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> in this region. With high probability we can assume that on that day the main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> in Altai precipitation are as follows: the Naryan-Mar area for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) pollen, tundra zones of the East European Plain for alder (Alnaster sp.) pollen and the steppe regions of Kazakhstan, and the West Altai for pollen grains  – the dominant component of the pollen spectrum...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPollen plays a {{critical}} role in the life cycle of all flowering plants, generating a polarized pollen tube that delivers sperm to the eggs in the interior of the flower. Pollen tubes perceive multiple extracellular signals during their extended growth through different floral environments; these environments discriminate among pollen grains, allowing only those that are appropriately recognized to invade. The phases of pollen tube growth include interactions that establish pollen polarity, entry of pollen tubes into female cell walls, and adhesion-based pollen tube motility through a carbohydrate-rich matrix. Recent studies have identified cells within the female germ unit as important <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> guidance cues. Other signals undoubtedly exist, and their discovery will require genetic screens that target diploid tissues as well as haploid male and female cells...|$|E

More than 100 million Chinese people suffer from pollen allergy. Pollen allergy induces bronchitis, bronchial asthma, pulmonary heart disease, and may even be life-threatening. Thus, pollen allergies greatly affect the daily life of individuals. High-resolution WorldView- 2 remote sensing data and vegetation distribution features were used to detect the dominant tree species in the study area and obtain canopy distribution information on different tree species. In this way, the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> from different tree species were identified. Using remote sensing technology, the overall accuracy of tree species recognition for the study area exceeds 86 %. Most plants in the study area flower during the spring, so the pollen allergenic risk zones are extensive during spring and sparse in fall. Based on the spatial ranges of pollen dispersal during different seasons, areas were identified that might contain pollen concentrations detrimental to pollen-sensitive individuals...|$|E

Rudbeckia triloba, native of North America, is perennial specie, with 150 cm of length, glabrate stems, blades ovate to subcordate, or elliptic leaves, with serrate margins. The capitulas (10 - 30) are long pedunculate, with conic to sub hemispheric receptacles (8 - 15 x 10 - 15 mm), with the dark purple paleae (5 - 6. 5 mm). There are 7 - 15 ray florets; the laminae is yellow-orange, linear to oblanceolate, 8 - 17 x 3 - 8 mm. Senecio inaequidens is a perennial herb, native of South Africa. The cross pollination with non-specialized insects ensures {{the production of a}} large number of seeds, but self-pollination have also been reported, increasing the chances of the specie to colonize new territory, where other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> are missing.

40|$|Pollen {{analysis}} {{provides a}} powerful tool for understanding past human activity {{and its impact on the}} environment. This is due to pollen being preserved in a wide range of sedimentary environments and pollen being derived from, and therefore providing a record of, vegetation beyond the sampling location. While the basic premise of pollen analysis has remained constant since the pioneering work of Lennart von Post 100 years ago, methodological approaches for interpretation of pollen records have continued to evolve. Large datasets can now be compiled for identifying and exploring the complexities of pollen data temporally and spatially. Here two Holocene pollen stratigraphic changes in the British Isles are focused upon: the Ulmus and Tilia declines. Methodologies for examining the chronological controls on the timing of these changes and disentangling the processes recorded in pollen data are presented. Of particular note are the complexities of separating human impacts from natural processes in coastal wetland records which have been one of the main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> data from lowland England. We argue that it is only by unravelling the complexities of both the chronological and pollen data that extant theories on the interaction between past human activity and vegetation change can be rigorously tested...|$|E
40|$|According to Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule, uniparental {{reproduction}} {{is associated with}} colonizing plants because it provides a means for population establishment following single long-distance dispersal events. There is, however, limited evidence for the applicability of Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule to invasive plants. We determined the breeding systems of three invasive milkweed species-Asclepias curassavica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and G. physocarpus-in their invaded range in south-east Queensland, Australia. Although dependent on pollinators for reproduction, hand-pollinations revealed that all three species are self-compatible {{which is consistent with}} Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule and notable because milkweeds are generally self-incompatible. In progeny performance trials, seedlings from self-pollinations generally did not perform as well as those from cross-pollinations, but the differences were minor. Evidence for self-compatibility in G. physocarpus is a particularly noteworthy feature of this study, as this species has been reported to be self-incompatible in its native range and may thus have evolved self-compatibility during the invasion process. Furthermore, potential for hybridization between the two Gomphocarpus species was observed. Hybridization may have assisted the invasion of these species through providing additional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> and/or broadening genetic variation. Our study adds to the growing evidence that breeding systems are significant for the process of plant invasion...|$|E

40|$|Pollinators, {{especially}} bees, {{are essential}} to terrestrial ecosystems. They ensure the maintenance of certain ecological processes, like superior plants’ reproduction. In the past decades, agricultural intensification has caused extensive environmental changes, with major impacts on biodiversity, especially on the pollinators, which reflects the loss of fruits and seeds sets. Here, we review studies that elucidate the causes of decline of pollinators, consequences of landscape changes to agriculture and possibilities to bees’ conservation. Many studies have related the loss of pollinators {{to changes in the}} landscape, such as the conversion of native forests into cultivated areas, which causes loss of important elements for bees (e. g., <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen,</b> nectar and oil, as well as varied nesting sites). Studies involving landscape ecology allow us to assess the effects of different farming practices over the richness and abundance of pollinators. Among the landscape elements performing positive influence on bees, the presence of remaining forests nearby cultivated areas proved to be a very important factor. Nevertheless, studies that evaluate all ground cover with a more integrated approach are still required to assess the effects of landscape context on the diversity and on the abundance of bees related to productivity of crops. Researches like these could provide specific data that strengthen the need for the conservation of different plants and animals, and could offer subsidies to propose necessary information for the execution of public and private policies, aimed at the conservation of the biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Cave {{palynology}} {{has been}} widely used to reconstruct past vegetation in areas where other conventional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> are scarce. However, the mechanisms involved in pollen transport, deposition and accumulation in caves are still poorly understood, mostly {{because of the number}} of interplaying factors that affect these processes. In this paper we explore some of these factors further by assessing differences in pollen assemblages in transects of surface samples from six caves in the Zagros Mountains of Kurdish Iraq. Simple sac-like caves show a clear pattern in pollen distribution with anemophilous taxa declining from the highest percentages near the front of the cave to lower percentages at the rear of the cave and entomophilous taxa showing the opposite trend. There is a tendency for this pattern to be most marked in caves which are narrow in relation to their length. It is less clear at Shanidar Cave, most probably because of the geometry of the cave but also because of the disturbance and mixing of the superficial sediments caused by the large numbers of people visiting the cave. Only one of the sampled caves shows a different pattern, which is likely to reflect its geomorphological complexity and, consequently, its air circulation. Other factors, such as the presence of a cave entrance flora, are considered but here they seem to have little influence on the pollen assemblages, contrary to that found in temperate-zone caves...|$|E

The amount <b>of</b> ragweed <b>pollen</b> recorded at Rzeszów was significantly higher than in Poznań and Kraków.

Sampling of pollen loads from bees extended from the beginning of May until the end of September 2016 and was carried out at 7 -day intervals using pollen traps mounted at the entrance of beehives. A total of 73 pollen load samples were collected from the study area. Fifty-nine taxa from 31 plant families were identified in the analyzed material. From 4 to 21 taxa (average 9. 5) were recorded in one sample. The pollen of Brassicaceae (“others”), Taraxacum type, Solidago type, and Rumex had the highest frequency in the pollen loads examined. Apart from these four taxa, pollen grains of Rubus type, Poaceae (“others”), Calluna, Fagopyrum, Trifolium repens s. l., Phacelia, Aster type, Melampyrum, Quercus, Cornus, and Veronica were recorded in the dominant pollen group. The forest habitat taxa that provided pollen rewards to honeybees in the Bojanów forest complex were the following: Rubus, Calluna, Prunus, Tilia, Frangula alnus, Pinus, Quercus, Cornus, Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix, and Vaccinium. Apart from forest vegetation, the species from meadows and wastelands adjacent to this forest complex, represented by Taraxacum, Rumex, Plantago, Poaceae, Trifolium repens, and Solidago, proved to be an important source of pollen.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate selected Asteraceae (Calendula officinalis ‘Persimmon Beauty’ and ‘Santana’, Centaurea macrocephala, Cosmos sulphureus, Dahlia pinnata, Tagetes patula, Tithonia rotundifolia, and Zinnia elegans) as pollen sources for pollinators. Under urban conditions in Lublin, SE Poland, the investigated plants flowered from late June to the end of October. The mass of pollen produced in florets and capitula was found to be species-related. The highest pollen amounts per 10 florets (10. 1 mg) as well as per capitulum (249. 7 mg) were found for C. macrocephala. The mass of pollen yielded by a single plant depended on both the pollen mass delivered per disk florets and the proportion of disk florets in capitulum, and the flowering abundance of the plants. A single plant of D. pinnata and a single plant of T. rotundifolia each produced the largest pollen mass. Mean pollen yield per 1 m 2 of a plot ranged from 6. 2 g (Z. elegans) to 60. 7 g (D. pinnata). Pollen grains are tricolporate, with echinate exine, medium or small in size. They can be categorised as oblatespherical, spherical, and prolatespherical. The principal visitors to C. macrocephala, C. sulphureus, and C. officinalis were honey bees, whereas bumble bees dominated on T. rotundifolia and D. pinnata.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} was to improve {{understanding}} of the population genetics and basic ecological requirements of B. distinguendus in order to develop management advice and to direct conservation action. I used microsatellite genetic analyses to address questions about large-scale population genetics as well as finer-scale aspects of ecology. I found that populations of B. distinguendus throughout its Scottish range showed no significant inbreeding and little, if any, diploid male production. I also found that there was considerable gene flow between sites at a local scale (3 – 55 km), with significant differentiation only arising between widely dispersed (> 100 km) island groups. At a finer scale I found that B. distinguendus nests at low density and is able to forage long distances from the nest. I also used standardised transect counts of bumblebees and flowers, together with pollen load sampling, to investigate bumblebee ecology. I examined the habitat use of foraging B. distinguendus (and other bumblebee species) in both a pastoral and a mixed farming system. There were strong positive relationships between the density of bumblebees and the density of flowers. The densities of different species of bumblebee were related to the densities of flowers of different plant species. I also examined the phenology and foraging ecology of B. distinguendus in the Hebrides. I found that B. distinguendus is a “late” emerging and nesting bumblebee, with a “medium” length colony cycle. I quantified the phenology of B. distinguendus  at ten important plant species and found that no single plant species provided resources throughout this colony cycle. I also found that B. distinguendus collected pollen from a limited range of plant species.

Confirmation of glyphosate-resistant (GR) common and giant ragweed in Nebraska justified the need to determine the mechanism of resistance, dispersal of resistance genes via pollen, and to develop an integrated management program. The objectives of this research were to: 1) determine the mechanism of glyphosate resistance in a common ragweed biotype from Nebraska; 2) evaluate the effect of varying growth temperatures on efficacy, absorption, and translocation of glyphosate or 2, 4 -D in GR and susceptible (GS) common and giant ragweed biotypes; 3) quantify the pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) from GR to GS giant ragweed under field conditions; and 4) evaluate the integrated management of giant ragweed with preplant tillage followed by PRE and/or POST herbicide programs in corn and soybean. Experiments were conducted to determine mutation(s), and amplification of the EPSPS gene (target-site mechanisms), as well as differences in uptake/translocation and the metabolism of glyphosate (non-target site mechanisms) between GR and known GS common ragweed biotypes. The results suggest that a slow rate of glyphosate absorption and translocation likely prevents the build-up of the minimum inhibitory glyphosate concentration required at the target site, resulting in resistance to glyphosate in a common ragweed biotype from Nebraska. Experiments conducted to study the effect of temperature on the efficacy of 2, 4 -D or glyphosate in common and giant ragweed suggested that control improved at warm temperatures (29 / 17 0 C d/n) compared to cooler temperatures (20 / 11 0 C d/n) due to increased translocation in common ragweed, and increased absorption and/or translocation in giant ragweed biotypes studied.

It was found that for the different paper types 42 – 52 % of the particulates collected were found in the ink and thus both the paper and the ink are potentially valuable sources of trace evidence in a forensic investigation. The second study sought to address the differences in the spatial distribution of particulates on documents when writing took place before or after the paper was treated with UV particulates. Ninety-six observations were made for each piece of paper tested and it was found that when the writing took place after the particulates were applied to the paper; more particulates were retained on the paper in contrast to when the writing took place before the particulate treatment. The spatial distribution of particulates was also affected, with particulates being retained in the folds of the paper when the writing took place before particulate treatment in contrast to a more erratic pattern that emerged due to the pressure of the hand of the writer when the writing took place after the particulate treatment. The third study utilised lily (Lilium) pollen grains and the findings broadly concurred with the second study. The main difference identified was when the writing took place before the particulates were applied; when UV powder was used the particulates were retained in the folds of the paper whereas this pattern was not seen to the same degree when pollen grains were used due to their ‘stickier’ nature.

40|$|Aim Beringia, far {{north-eastern}} Siberia and north-western North America, {{was largely}} unglaciated during the Pleistocene. Although this region {{has long been}} considered an ice-age refugium for arctic herbs and shrubs, {{little is known about}} its role as a refugium for boreal trees and shrubs during the last glacial maximum (LGM, c. 28, 000 – 15, 000 calibrated years before present). We examine mapped patterns of pollen percentages to infer whether six boreal tree and shrub taxa (Populus, Larix, Picea, Pinus, Betula, Alnus/Duschekia) survived the harsh glacial conditions within Beringia. Methods Extensive networks of pollen records have the potential to reveal distinctive temporal–spatial patterns that discriminate between local- and longdistance <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen.</b> We assembled pollen records for 149 lake, peat and alluvial sites from the Palaeoenvironmental Arctic Sciences database, plotting pollen percentages at 1000 -year time intervals from 21, 000 to 6000 calibrated years before present. Pollen percentages are interpreted with an understanding of modern pollen representation and potential sources of long-distance pollen during the glacial maximum. Inferences from pollen data are supplemented by published radiocarbon dates of identified macrofossils, where available. Results Pollen maps for individual taxa show unique temporal-spatial patterns, but the data for each taxon argue more strongly for survival within Beringia than for immigration from outside regions. The first increase of Populus pollen percentages in the western Brooks Ranges is evidence that Populus trees survived the LGM in central Beringia. Both pollen and macrofossil evidence support Larix survival in western Beringia (WB), but data for Larix in eastern Beringia (EB) are unclear. Given the similar distances of WB and EB to glacial-age boreal forests in temperate latitudes of Asia and North America, the widespread presence of Picea pollen in EB and Pinus pollen in WB indicates that Picea and Pinus survived within these respective regions. Betula pollen is broadly distributed but highly variable in glacial-maximum samples, suggesting that Betula trees or shrubs survived in restricted populations throughout Beringia. Alnus/Duschekia percentages show complex patterns, but generally support a glacial refugium in WB. Main conclusions Our interpretations have several implications, including: (1) the rapid post-glacial migration rate reported for Picea in western Canada may be over estimated, (2) the expansion of trees and shrubs within Beringia should have been nearly contemporaneous with climatic change, (3) boreal trees and shrubs are capable of surviving long periods in relatively small populations (at the lower limit of detection in pollen data) and (4) long-distance migration {{may not have been the}} predominant mode of vegetation response to climatic change in Beringia...|$|E

This study examines the sedimentology of salt marshes and lagoonal sediments from coastal wetland settings in south east Sicily. Palaeoenvironmentasl tudies {{have been carried out}} to assess the recent evolution of disturbed coastal wetlands, and to examine the sensitivity of these depositional settings in recording historical environmental change. The evolution of recent coastal wetland environments in the region can be related to anthrpogenic disturbance phases in drainage catchments due to changes in land-use. Archaeo-historical changes to the coastal topography are identified, in relation to the development of present-day coastal wetland areas in south east Sicily. The impact of 19 th early 20 th century salt workings is recognised as a major and continuing factor in the condition of present day wetlands. Measurement of 210 Pb, 137 Cs, pollen content, major and trace elements, loss on ignition and other sedimentological features generates valuable information on depositional processes that have occurred over the last 100 - 150 years. Sub-surfaces edimentological changes recognised in cores extracted from shallow sediment sequences (< 50 cm) can be related to coastal wetland land-use changes and hydrological flood events. A 30 cm depth sediment sequence analysed from the Mulinello estuary records the interaction between estuarine channel processes, following embankment construction and the variable influence of catchment generated flood episodes. A clearly identifiable change in accretion and core composition occurred during the mid-late 1940 's and early 1950 's which coincides with recorded peaks in monthly rainfall totals. The impact of marsh development, flooding and recovery is highlighted by the variable abundance of dominant pollen types. A marked increase of ruderal pollen types during periods of channel-dominated deposition is contrasted with an abundance of halophyte pollen during low-energy phases of organic marsh sedimentation. The two lagoonal cores from Pantano Piccolo record successive hydrological changes, due almost certainly to artificial enclosure in the late l 8 th to early 19 th century. The apparent change in water levels dramatically affected marginal salt marsh communities. Artificial impoundment generated a lagoonal setting conducive to the accumulation of local and extralocal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen,</b> reflecting the re- establishment of salt marsh vegetation. Although largely separated from catchment-overland flow patterns during the 20 th century, large magnitude rainfall events were recorded in lagoonal accretion patterns. 21 OPb-derived sediment accretion rates and estimated pollen accumulation rates have enabled the response and sensitivity, of coastal wetland and nearby plant communities to phases of disturbance and recovery, to be determined. Due to artificial impoundment of the lagoon, fringing-halophyte communities and organic accretion migrated outwards to occupy their present marginal position. To aid the interpretation of pollen encountered in estuarine and lagoonal settings, soil samples from nearby land surfaces around Pantano Piccolo were analysed for pollen content. Soil surfaces reflected the dominance of gravity fallout from surface vegetation and the accumulation of pollen from regional-atmospheric sources. The reliability of the multi-proxy approach and palaeoenvironmental analyses used, indicate that coastal wetlands in south east Sicily have evolved in a dynamic system of punctuated equilibria, due to climatic events and human activity over the last 100 - 150 years. Their current status reflects the continued pressure on coastal systems by anthropogenic development and recent conservation measures. This work is funded by Brunel Universit...|$|E
40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. : Meliaceae) is a {{plant species}} {{originating}} in India introduced to Brazil mainly {{due to its}} insecticidal properties. However, the effect of such insecticidal properties on floral visitors, wild or reared, is not known. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of this plant species to Apis mellifera and its importance {{as a source of}} pollen and nectar for beekeeping. Experiments on the neem floral biology, floral visitors, A. mellifera colony development in areas with and without neem in the caatnga a coastal vegetations and larval and adult survivalship when fed with pollen or nectar of neem in controlled environment were carried out in the bee labs of the Universidade Federal do CearÃ - UFC, Universidade Estadual Vale do AcaraÃ - UVA and private properties in the state of CearÃ, Brazil. Results showed that all neem individuals studied bore bissexual flowers, with anthesis occurring around 16 : 00 h and most flower buds presenting receptive stigmas and releasing pollen, though still unviable, 24 h before anthesis. The highest pollen viability was observed at anthesis. Flowers of A. indica produced nectar in diminute amounts that did not allow sampling with capilars. Apis mellifera workers were the only floral visitors registered showing higher frequency early in the morning, when searching for pollen and nectar, and pollinating neem flowers. The wind played no role in neem pollination. Results also showed that honeybee colonies placed in the area with neem produced significantly (p< 0. 05) larger brood area than those palcedwhere neem was absent, both in caatinga and coastal vegetations. This difference was significanlty (p< 0. 05) greater in caatinga, where there were less natural resources during the dry season than in the coastal vegetation. Regarding brood mortality, that in caatinga with neem was higher (p< 0. 05) than thaof coastal vegetation with neem, and when compared within the same biome, brood mortality in colonies placed in areas with neem was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than that in colonies of areas without neem. Despite brood mortality be higher in areas with neem, such mortality percentual was less than 10 %, and within normal mortality parameters for honeybee brood. Under controlled environment, adult A. mellifera fed exclusively on neem were the ones with the shortest lifespan, but as neem was progressively replaced in the diet for other food sources, the worker lifespan increased. Flower odor per si did not produce repelence nor affect bee lifespan. Honeybee brood reared in artificial cups in the lab receiving larval food + neem pollen presented 100 % mortality, significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than the other treatments (larval food, larval food + 100 % pollen from other sources, larval food + 50 % pollen from other sources + 50 % neem pollen). It was concluded that the use of neem in association with other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> and nectar seems to estimulate colony growth due to the augment in food availability compensating, in populational terms, the increase in brood mortality. This effect seems to be inversally proportional to the scarcity of other floral resources, being as higher as shorter becomes the availability of other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollen</b> and nectar. However, both neem pollen and neem nectar are toxic for adults and larvas of A. mellifera, and it is not advisable its use as exclusive food source to these bees. Regarding other floral vistors of caatinga and coastal vegetation fauna, apparently neem does not constitute any threat or food resource, because no native species was observed exploiting this plant species. There is a need for further studies to determine safety levels for use of neem in beekeeping, to learn about other possible effects on A. mellifera individuals and colony and to investigate better the relationship of this plant species with native floral visitors. O nim (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. : Meliaceae) Ã uma planta de origem indiana introduzida no territÃrio brasileiro principalmente devido Ãs suas propriedades inseticidas. No entanto, nÃo se sabe ainda como essas propriedades afetam os visitantes florais e seus possÃveis efeitos sobre polinizadores silvestres e para a apicultura. O presente estudo objetivou, portanto, avaliar a toxicidade dessa espÃcie vegetal para Apis mellifera e sua importÃncia como planta apÃcola. Para tanto, experimentos sobre a biologia floral da espÃcie, visitantes florais, desenvolvimento de colÃnias de A. mellifera em Ãreas com e sem nim nos bioma caatinga e mata litorÃnea e sobrevivÃncia de larvas e adultos alimentados com pÃlen e/ou nÃctar de nim em ambiente controlado foram conduzidos no LaboratÃrio de Abelhas da Universidade Federal do CearÃ - UFC, no LaboratÃrio de Apicultura da Universidade Estadual Vale do AcaraÃ - UVA e em propriedades particulares no Estado do CearÃ. Os resultados mostraram que todos os indivÃduos estudados de nim apresentaram flores bissexuadas, com antese por volta das 16 horas e que a maioria dos botÃes florais encontra-se com seus estigmas receptivos e suas anteras liberando pÃlen, ainda inviÃvel, 24 horas antes da antese. A maior viabilidade do pÃlen ocorre no momento da antese. Foi encontrado nÃctar nas flores de A. indica, porÃm em quantidades diminutas que nÃo permitiu a captura pelos tubos capilares. As abelhas Apis mellifera foram os Ãnicos visitantes florais, apresentando maior freqÃÃncia logo nas primeiras horas do amanhecer, onde procuraram coletar nÃctar e pÃlen, sendo as responsÃvÃis pela polinizaÃÃo do nim. O vento nÃo apresentou influÃncia na polinizaÃÃo. Os resultados mostraram que as colÃnias distribuÃdas na Ãrea com nim apresentaram uma populaÃÃo de crias significativamente maior (p< 0, 05) do que as dispostas na Ãrea sem nim, tanto na caatinga como na mata litorÃnea. Essa diferenÃa foi siginificativamente maior (p< 0, 05) na caatinga, onde havia menos recursos naturais no perÃodo seco do ano, do que na mata litorÃnea. Quanto Ã mortalidade de larvas das colÃnias, a da caatinga com nim foi mais elevada (p< 0, 05) do que a da mata litorÃnea com nim, e quando comparadas dentro do mesmo bioma, a mortalidade das larvas das colÃnias nas Ãreas com nim foi significativamente superior (p< 0, 05) Ãs das colÃnias colocadas nas Ãreas sem nim. Apesar da mortalidade das crias ter sido mais elevada em Ãreas com nim, este percentual de mortalidade geralmente foi inferior a 10 %, valor limite considerado aceitÃvel. Em ambinete controlado, adultos de A. mellifera que se alimentaram exclusivamente dos recursos florais de A. indica foram os que apresentaram menor tempo mÃdio de vida. Verificou-se que na medida em que os recursos florais de A. indica eram substituÃdos por outras fontes alimentares na dieta, o tempo mÃdio de vida aumentava. O simples odor das flores nÃo apresentou efeito de repelÃncia e nÃo afetou a longevidade das operÃrias. As larvas de operÃrias de A. mellifera criadas em cÃpulas artificiais, sob condiÃÃes de laboratÃrio, que receberam alimento larval juntamente com pÃlen exclusivo de A. indica tiveram mortalidade de 100 %, sendo significativamente superior (p< 0, 05) Ã mortalidade das demais dietas (alimento larval, alimento larval + 100 % pÃlen diverso, alimento larval + 50 % pÃlen diverso + 50 % pÃlen de nim). Conclui-se entÃo que o uso do nim associado Ã outras fontes de pÃlen e nÃctar parece estimular o desenvolvimento das colÃnias pelo acrÃscimo da oferta de alimento, compensando, em termos populacionais, o aumento da mortalidade larval. Esse efeito parece ser inversamente proporcional Ã escassez de outros recursos florais, sendo tÃo maior quanto menor for a disponibilidade de outras fontes de pÃlen e nÃctar. No entanto, tanto o nÃctar quanto o pÃlen do nim sÃo tÃxicos para adultos e larvas de A. mellifera, nÃo sendo aconselhÃvel o seu uso como fonte exclusiva de alimento para essas abelhas. No que se refere a outros visitantes florais da fauna da caatinga e mata litorÃnea cearense, aparententemente o nim nÃo constitui ameaÃa ou recurso alimentar, haja vista que nÃo foi verificada visitaÃÃo por parte de qualquer espÃcie nativa. HÃ a necessidade de maiores estudos para determinar nÃveis seguros de utilizaÃÃo do nim na apicultura, conhecer outros possÃveis efeitos sobre os indivÃduos e colÃnia de A. mellifera e aprofundar o conhecimento da relaÃÃo dessa planta com os visitantes florais nativos...|$|E
25|$|Bees collect pollen {{in their}} pollen baskets {{and carry it}} back to the hive. In the hive, pollen is used as a protein source {{necessary}} during brood-rearing.
