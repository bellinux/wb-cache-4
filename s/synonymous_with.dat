40|$|In 1931 - 1934 Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz {{formulated}} {{two versions}} of the theory of meaning (A 1 and A 2). Tarski showed that A 2 allows for <b>synonymous</b> names existing <b>with</b> different denotations. Tarski and Ajdukiewicz found that this feature disparages the theory. The force of Tarski's argument rests on the assumption that none of an adequate theory of meaning allows for <b>synonymous</b> names existing <b>with</b> different denotations. In {{the first part of this}} paper we present an appropriate fragment of A 2 and Tarski's argument. In the second part we consider an elementary, interpreted language in which individual constants occur, but not functional symbols. For such a language we define semantically a relation of synonymity for simple names and show that it fulfills syntactical conditions formulated by Ajdukiewicz in A 2 and allows for <b>synonymous</b> names <b>with</b> different denotations...|$|R
50|$|Social care is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} <b>synonymous</b> term <b>with</b> social welfare, and {{as an alternative to}} social work. The term often implies informal networks of support and assistance as well as services funded following assessments by social work and other professions.|$|R
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> regeneration, as being <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E
5|$|A {{contradictory}} figure, Caion was {{equated with}} infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently unsubstantiated allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians.

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{venture capital}} firms focused their {{investment}} activity primarily on starting and expanding companies.

50|$|Although not a <b>synonymous</b> class <b>with</b> ground-attack aircraft, fighter-bombers {{were usually}} {{used for the}} role, and proved to excel at it, {{even when they were}} only lightly armored.

25|$|Spear. This is {{the most}} <b>synonymous</b> weapon <b>with</b> the art.

The Five Fists of Xing Yi have variations which are trained with the spear.|$|R
5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word elf {{began to be}} used in English as a term loosely <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel, in his {{survey of}} the genus Calvatia, defined the section Sculpta to contain C.sculpta and C.subcretacea.

These were specific mtDNA mutations that are shared exclusively by Australian aborigines and these Indian tribes, and no other known human groupings.|$|R
50|$|Then Sumuqan kills {{his father}} Harab (plough), marries his mother Ki (earth) {{and his sister}} and the cycle of carnage begins. The city of Dunnum was a <b>synonymous</b> toponym, <b>with</b> many places so named, such as one in the {{vicinity}} of Isin and another lying of the right bank of the Euphrates in what is now northern Syria. A dunnu is a fortified settlement, but the word can also be translated as strength or violence.|$|R
30|$|Much of {{the work}} of {{demography}} is directed at the study of lifespan. Lifespan is <b>synonymous</b> both <b>with</b> longevity, chronological age at death, and thanatological age at birth. One’s ultimate completed lifespan is constant throughout life, though we have no knowledge of it until death: It is assigned retrospectively. Demographers have more often used lifespan or age-at-death as a measure of mortality, or similar, than as a measure on which to compare individuals or structure data.|$|R
5|$|Makovicky's latest {{analysis}} includes IVPP V12722 ("Xuanhuasaurus"), a Late Jurassic ceratopsian from China that, at the time, was awaiting publication, but {{has since}} been published as Xuanhuaceratops. Kulceratops and Turanoceratops are considered nomina dubia in this study. Makovicky believes Lamaceratops, Magnirostris, and Platyceratops to be junior synonyms of Bagaceratops, and Bainoceratops to be <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> Protoceratops.|$|E
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> digitatus.

5|$|Originally, the {{decision}} to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service {{expressed concern that the}} battleship, whose name has become <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become <b>synonymous</b> <b>with</b> the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{the visual}} {{analogue}} scale (VAS) {{may be useful}} for measuring change on subjective and potentially transient phenomena, there is concern about the reliability and {{construct validity of the}} associated measurement variables. The present study reports evidence for tau-equivalence of change scores associated with VASs designed for assessing tense arousal <b>with</b> <b>synonymous</b> indicators. This psychometric property allows an estimation of the truescore structure of the cross-sectional measurement variables in a longitudinal SEM model, including method e ects. Findings suggest that VASs associated <b>with</b> <b>synonymous</b> indicators may yield highly reliable measurement variables. However, imperfect dynamic bipolarity was observed when data based on antonymous indicators were introduced into the analyses, a rather puzzling e ect, which deserves further elaboration...|$|R
