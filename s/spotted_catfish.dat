40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: {{the fishing}} {{activity}} throughout the Upper Paraguay River Basin has huge financial and biological importance. This retrospective {{study investigated the}} occurrence of injuries caused by fish of the Pseudoplatystoma genus (<b>spotted</b> <b>catfish</b> or pintado and striped catfish or cachara) in professional fishermen of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul State. METHODS: we collected information through a questionnaire, showing that fishing is carried out by workers with low level of education, mainly adults or seniors with low financial gains. RESULTS: in Miranda town, 126 of 315 fishermen were interviewed and 38 individuals reported injuries (30. 16 %). In Corumbá town, 355 of 627 fishermen were interviewed, and 111 (56, 61 %) reported injuries. The lacerated lesions were the most common, associate with edema, erythema, radiating pain {{to the root of}} the limb, paresthesias and local necrosis. More rarely, they reported the occurrence of fever, cardiac arrhythmias and cold sweating. These manifestations may be associated with late secondary infections or envenomations caused by the toxins in the stingers of the fish. Many questionable and inappropriate treatments are used, sometimes aggravating the injuries. CONCLUSIONS: the freshwater professional fishermen need guidance on first aid measures and prevention of accidents caused by these venomous fish...|$|E

From the lateral view, spores were biconvex, with thickness of 4. 2 +/- 0. 7 (3. 9 - 4. 9) mu m. the polar capsules were elongated and equal in size, 6. 2 +/- 0. 3 (5. 2 - 6. 2) mu m in length, and 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 (1. 4 - 1. 9) mu m in width. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the plasmodial wall had delicate projections towards the host tissue and a thin layer that prevented contact between the host cells and the parasite. in the ectoplasm, few mitochondria were observed, while generative cells, early stages of sporogenesis, and advanced spore development occurred in the plasmodial periphery, and more mature spores in internal regions. Histopathological analysis showed that plasmodia developed in the sub-epithelial connective tissue of gill filaments, causing compression of the adjacent tissues, deformation of gill filaments, and lamellar fusion. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 18 S rDNA genes and using only Henneguya/Myxobolus species parasites of siluriform fish, showed grouping according to the fish family.

5000|$|Fishing at Lake Berryessa can be {{successful}} year-round as the lake is home to both warm-water and cold-water fish species. Lake Berryessa {{offers a variety of}} fish from Sunfish to landlocked Salmon. Because fish species are plentiful, fishing can be done in a variety of ways; from finesse techniques, bait fishing, and to trolling in the deep. Fish species at Lake Berryessa include; Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides), Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomeiu), <b>Spotted</b> Bass, Channel <b>Catfish</b> (Ictalurus punctatus), Bullhead Catfish (Ictalurus dolomeiu), White Catfish (Ameiurus catus), Carp (Cyprinus carpio), Sacramento Pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Crappie, Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), Rainbow Trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), Brown and Brook Trout, Kokanee, and also Chinook Salmon (Onchorhynchus tschawytscha). The Rainbow Trout species is native to the region while many other species were introduced. [...] Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass were both introduced into the lake in the late 1950s and Spotted Bass followed in the 1980s. Bass and Salmon are mostly noted as sport fishing species, Bluegill, Black and White Crappie, and Catfish are more of a recreational and beginners type of fish and Carp and Pikeminnow are usually not favored among anglers. The introduced species of carp, is also present and feeds on organic matter, water snails, bloodworm, fresh water mussels as well as their own eggs. [...] Besides the Sacramento Pikeminnow, Lake Berryessa also has the Golden Shiner and Threadfin Shad which are usually baitfish to the other species of fish. Aside from the fish Lake Berryessa also supports other aquatic organisms such as Crawfish, Clams, and Otters. The Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has published guidelines for the amount of fish from Lake Berryessa that should be eaten. A copy of these guidelines can also be found at Lake Berryessa’s Visitor Center. Mercury levels at Lake Berryessa are on the rise and there are no fish that OEHHA recommend to eat more than three times a week. In context of Mercury Trouts are the best option for Berryessa at this time. [...] Fishing regulations accord with standard California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations. [...] There are tournaments scheduled throughout nine of the twelve months out of the year for Bass.|$|R
40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{survey was conducted}} round the year in three fish markets at Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The selected markets were categorized as rural market (Sutiakhali market), a peri-urban market (Kamal Ranjeet market, BAU) and an urban market (Notun Bazar market, Mymensingh town). It was learnt from the survey that the availability of Small Indigenous Fish Species (SIS) declined {{to a great extent}} {{over the last few years}} and at presently many of such fish species are either threatened or at the edge of extinction. The supply of SIS was highest in KR market (37 % of total) and more or less similar in Notun Bazar and Sutiakhali fish market (25 and 27 % respectively). The total supply of SIS fluctuated from 25 % to 35 % throughout the year in these markets. About 48 SIS were found in the sampled markets over the survey period. The highest number of species (45) was found in KR market followed by Notun Bazar (42) and Sutiakhali (37) fish markets. During the survey, three critically endangered species namely, schilbid catfish, garua catfish and rita were found in these markets. Beside these, other 11 and 10 species were listed to be endangered and vulnerable respectively. The biodiversity of 21 SIS found in three markets were no threat at all. Three species (guntea loach, Indian glass barb and flying barb) were 'data deficient' as reported by the IUCN Red Book (IUCN-Bangladesh 2000). From the supply point of view small prawn, <b>spotted</b> snakehead, stinging <b>catfish,</b> pool barb, striped dwarf catfish, Gangetic mystus, walking catfish and tank goby were the prominent fish. The least available species found in this survey were lesser spiny eel, barred spiny eel, Gangetic ailia, freshwater garfish, zig-zag eel, flying barb, Ganges river sprat, freshwater river shad and dwarf gourami. The weight of SIS available in Notun bazar was highest and nearly double than other two markets. There was no significant difference recorded in the supply of SIS in Sutiakhali and KR markets. The average monthly SIS supply was 185, 192 and 467 kg in KR, Sutiakhali and Notun Bazar, respectively; therefore, the cumulative average supply was 844 kg per month in three markets. The price of SIS ranged widely from taka 50 - 450 /kg depending on species, location of market, time of purchase and the condition of fish. In general small prawn, ticto barb, dwarf gourami, Gangetic leaffish, and Annandale loach were sold at a lower price (ranged taka 50 - 100 /kg) and these species could be considered at the bottom of the market-price list. Other SIS like walking catfish, climbing parch, butter catfish, cotio and schilbid catfish valued as highest price (ranged taka 150 - 450 /kg). There was no specific marketing chain for SIS in Mymensingh region. The components of marketing channels and their expansion varied with seasons and locations. The general pattern, however, was as this - after buying fish from fish farmer/fishermen, middlemen (locally known as Foria) used to buy fish to wholesale market and sell to the wholesalers. The retailers used to buy fish from wholesaler through auction to the highest bidders. The retailers then send the fish to particular market where the fish reached the consumers. The livelihood strategy of SIS retailers in three fish markets showed that socio-economic constraints such as low income, poor educational background, low economic status and lack of capital are the main constrains [sic]. Most of the retailers proposed that government should control the fish price throughout the year, so that the producers can get reasonable and stable price. Construction of cold storage and preservation facilities at market sites, improvement of road and communication, improvement of physical market facilities and reduction of market chain is essential. Credit facilities, improvement of their standard of living, health and sanitary condition, housing condition, children education and access to drinking water facilities were identified as additional aspects to improve socio-economic condition of SIS retailers...|$|R
