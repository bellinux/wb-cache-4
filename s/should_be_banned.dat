2500|$|Critics {{have pointed}} out that {{according}} to Federal Election Commission filings in 2009, dozens of Arab and Muslim Americans and Iranian advocacy organizations donated {{tens of thousands of dollars}} to J Street, representing [...] "a small fraction" [...] of the group's fund-raising. Donors included Lebanese-American businessman Richard Abdoo, who is a board member of Amideast and a former board member of the Arab American Institute, and Genevieve Lynch, who is also a member of the National Iranian American Council board. In response, Ben-Ami noted that J Street does not impose a religious or ethnic test to donations. [...] "It would be a very big mistake for pro-Israel organizations to apply a religious or ethnic litmus test for support for Israel from other Americans. I don't think anybody checked to see whether [...] John Hagee was Jewish before he was invited to keynote the AIPAC conference," [...] he said. [...] "I don't think we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>banning</b> Christians, I don't think we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>banning</b> Muslims, I don't think we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>banning</b> Arabs from finding a way to support Israel, to support its right to exist and to support a program that is designed to secure the future." [...] Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League noted that the ADL also receives donations from non-Jews and does not apply a religious test to donors. More than 20% of the citizens of Israel are Arab, most of whom are Muslim.|$|R

25|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi {{ordered that}} opium <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>banned</b> in Taiwan {{as soon as}} possible. However, due to the pervasiveness of opium addiction in Taiwanese society at the time, and {{the social and economic}} problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run narcotics monopoly.|$|E
