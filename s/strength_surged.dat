500|$|In late October, the American troop <b>strength</b> <b>surged</b> {{again with}} the arrival of 500 men from New York and Connecticut, {{including}} Brigadier General David Wooster. [...] This news, combined with the new battery trained on the fort, news of the failed relief expedition, and dwindling supplies, made the situation in the fort quite grim.|$|E
60|$|This {{time the}} effort {{answered}} the emergency; the swell rolled in, the men threw out their <b>strength,</b> a <b>surge</b> was felt, {{it was followed}} up by a strain, and le Feu-Follet shot off her bed into deep water, rolling, for want of ballast, nearly to her hammock-cloths. She soon lay directly over her anchor.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a bright}} sunshiny morning when Nigel found himself at last able to leave his turret chamber and to walk upon the rampart of the castle. There was a brisk {{northern}} wind, heavy and wet with the salt of the sea, and he felt, as he turned his face to it, fresh life and <b>strength</b> <b>surging</b> in his blood and bracing his limbs. He took his hand from Aylward's supporting arm and stood with his cap off, leaning on the rampart and breathing in the cool strong air. Far off upon the distant sky-line, half hidden by the heave of the waves, was the low white fringe of cliffs which skirted England. Between him and them lay the broad blue Channel, seamed and flecked with flashing foam, for a sharp sea was running and the few ships in sight were laboring heavily. Nigel's eyes traversed the wide-spread view, rejoicing in the change from the gray wall of his cramped chamber. Finally they settled upon a strange object at his very feet.|$|R
50|$|Staunton {{wrote the}} tournament book, which he titled The Chess Tournament (1852). Although an {{excellent}} {{description of the}} event, it was marred by ill grace with which he received Anderssen's victory. However Staunton's description of Anderssen as Germany's second best player after Anderssen won the 1851 International tournament may have been reasonable {{on the basis of}} what is now known about von der Lasa's skill, and Anderssen's playing <b>strength</b> had <b>surged</b> in the months preceding the tournament, as a result of training matches against strong players in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} season arguably {{remains the}} most successful in the club's history. After an inconsistent start the team hit form during the Autumn when they knocked Wimbledon and Newcastle United out of the League Cup. The reward was a home tie with a Liverpool team containing Bruce Grobbelaar, Jan Mølby, Steve McManaman, Dean Saunders and Mark Wright. Garry Kimble scored the only goal after 19 minutes prompting wild celebrations and {{a place in the}} quarter-finals. In the league, the team went from strength to <b>strength</b> and <b>surged</b> up the table. Middlesbrough ended the League Cup run after a replay and there was further disappointment when the team missed out on a trip to Wembley in the Football League Trophy when they lost to Stoke City over two legs in the area final.|$|R

40|$|Laser Doppler {{velocimeter}} (LDV) {{techniques were}} employed for testing a highly loaded, 550 m/sec (1800 ft/sec) tip speed, test fan stage, the objective to provide detailed mapping of the upstream, intrablade, and downstream flowfields of the rotor. Intrablade LDV measurements of velocity and flow angle were obtained along four streamlines {{passing through the}} leading edge at 45 %, 69 %, 85 %, and 95 % span measured from hub to tip, at 100 % of design speed, peak efficiency; 100 % speed, near surge; and 95 % speed, peak efficiency. At the design point, most passages appeared {{to have a strong}} leading edge shock, which moved forward with increasing <b>strength</b> near <b>surge</b> and at part speeds. The flow behind the shock was of a complex mixed subsonic and supersonic form. The intrablade flowfields were found to be significantly nonperiodic at 100 % design speed, peak efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of seasons with enhanced East Coast winter storm and storm surge activity are identified from among {{a set of}} global atmospheric circulation indices and local land and sea surface temperature anomalies. Without regard for storm <b>strength</b> or <b>surge</b> potential, the most active East Coast winter storm (ECWS) seasons occur in association with El Niño events. There is also some indication that such seasons are preferred under the positive phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation. In terms of storm surge potential, forecasts of strong ECWS activity are more skillful than direct forecasts {{of the number of}} extreme surge events. In both cases, sea surface temperatures (SST) off the southeast U. S. coast and in the Gulf of Mexico differentiate high seasonal activity from relatively inactive seasons. Warmer than normal SST in both regions during summer provide a measure of storm activity in the subsequent winter. The results provide a means of anticipating seasonal East Coast winter storm activity, and to some degree impacts, that is similar to widely used forecasts of tropical storm activity. From a predictive standpoint, forecasts of active strong storm seasons and low surge activity exhibit fairly high false alarm ratios. However, the false alarm rate fo...|$|R
5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation {{in the weeks after}} the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary August Decrees (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Now their attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist the <b>surging</b> <b>strength</b> of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative veto power for the king. Many of the reformers were left aghast by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.|$|R
40|$|Journal articleThe {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper involves the application of the joint probability method to the estimation of extreme water levels resulting from astronomical tides and surge residuals and the investigation of the effects of tideâsurge interactions on extreme water levels. The distribution of tide peaks was analysed from field records (< 20 years) and a 46 -year dataset of monthly maximum tidal amplitudes. Large surges were extracted from both field records and a numerical model hindcast covering the 48 largest storm events in the Irish Sea over the period 1959 â 2005. Extreme storm surges and tides were independently modelled using the generalised extreme value statistical model, and derived probability distributions were used to compute extreme water levels. An important, and novel, aspect of this research is an analysis of tideâsurge interactions and their effects on total water level; where interactions exist, they lead to lower total water levels than in the case of independency. The degree of decrease varies with interaction <b>strength,</b> magnitude of <b>surge</b> peak at a particular phase of tide and the distribution of peaks over a tidal cycle. Therefore, including interactions in the computation of extreme levels may provide very useful information at the design stage of coastal protection systems.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} the sea surface temperature (SST) over the Sea of Japan on precipitation and snowfall on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu, Japan, using precipitation and snowfall data from Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) stations, records of sea level pressure from meteorological stations, wind fields from the Japanese 25 -year reanalysis (JRA 25) dataset, and multiple SST datasets. We examined the data on various timescales from daily to monthly because SST over the Sea of Japan also varies on timescales shorter than a month. &# 8195;The results showed that the impact of SST over the Sea of Japan on precipitation on the Sea of Japan side was strongly timescale-dependent. On the shorter intraseasonal timescales of several days to a few weeks, SST had a clear impact on precipitation, while the impact was indistinct when the 15 -day and monthly averaged precipitation and SST values were used. On the other hand, cold surges over the Sea of Japan primarily accounted for the amount of precipitation on the Sea of Japan side. The timing and <b>strength</b> of cold <b>surges</b> controlled precipitation on all timescales. We clearly found the impact of cold surges on SST on 15 -day mean values, compared with the pentad mean values. To understand detailed impacts of SST on precipitation, including air-sea interaction processes over the Sea of Japan, synoptic and shorter intraseasonal timescales should be examined in addition to seasonal or interannual timescales...|$|R
40|$|Sea-level rise (SLR) {{from global}} warming may have severe {{consequences}} for coastal cities, particularly {{when combined with}} predicted increases in the <b>strength</b> of tidal <b>surges.</b> Predicting the regional impact of SLR flooding {{is strongly dependent on}} the modelling approach and accuracy of topographic data. Here, the areas under risk of sea water flooding for London boroughs were quantified based on the projected SLR scenarios reported in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR 5) and UK climatic projections 2009 (UKCP 09) using a tidally-adjusted bathtub modelling approach. Medium- to very high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are used to evaluate inundation extents as well as uncertainties. Depending on the SLR scenario and DEMs used, it is estimated that 3 %– 8 % of the area of Greater London could be inundated by 2100. The boroughs with the largest areas at risk of flooding are Newham, Southwark, and Greenwich. The differences in inundation areas estimated from a digital terrain model and a digital surface model are much greater than the root mean square error differences observed between the two data types, which may be attributed to processing levels. Flood models from SRTM data underestimate the inundation extent, so their results may not be reliable for constructing flood risk maps. This analysis provides a broad-scale estimate of the potential consequences of SLR and uncertainties in the DEM-based bathtub type flood inundation modelling for London boroughs...|$|R
