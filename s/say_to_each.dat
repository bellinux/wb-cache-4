500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|While many of {{the changes}} were down to the {{logistics}} of filming in Venice, some were for creative reasons, the most prominent being {{the inclusion of the}} famous love scene. [...] The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg, who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too. Originally intended to show the gulf between John's and Laura's mental states—John's denial and Laura's inability to let go—the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John's unease at Laura's marked display of grief. After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being [...] "silly", and the church was [...] "beautiful". Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life {{in terms of what the}} characters would actually <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and that the scripted version was [...] "overwritten", so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.|$|E
500|$|The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, {{but this}} created a {{continuity}} error {{from the first}} film in which Mike tells Sulley [...] "You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade." [...] Director Dan Scanlon {{said he had a}} dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, [...] "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary." [...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside." [...] Scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as [...] "an old monster expression", saying that [...] "it's what monsters always <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." ...|$|E

500|$|The serial later {{played out}} another chance for Ivan and Paul to be together. While interviewed by Claire Brand from Inside Soap, Bose said that Paul visits Ivan {{to give him}} back a CD he left over his house and [...] "both of them realise that they don't have {{anything}} left to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other." [...] Bose opined that Ivan and Paul were [...] "doomed from the start" [...] because he needed Ivan to commit. Rodney thinks that he can reunite Paul and Ivan and sets the pair up. He explained that the two had [...] "just about got over their awkwardness with one another" [...] and Rodney tells the whole pub that {{it is obvious that}} Paul and Ivan love each other and need to reconcile. The whole situation is [...] "embarrassing for both of them" [...] and Ivan is furious with Rodney's intervention. After some [...] "soul searching", Ivan calms down and [...] "stuns" [...] Paul when he asks him to get back with him. Paul rejects Ivan's advances, Bose said that Paul normally likes [...] "the big love affair" [...] but this time gives him his [...] "marching orders". Ivan is left heartbroken once again and decides to take some time away from the village. Bose stated that his character goes to see him off and there is a [...] "terrible silent moment" [...] between the two. He concluded that the audience could clearly see that Ivan and Paul were [...] "kicking themselves" [...] for not saying how they really feel.|$|E
500|$|The Incredible Melting Man {{was written}} and {{directed}} by filmmaker William Sachs. The idea for the film came to him when his mother, working in the office of a spray paint company, showed him [...] "gooey stuff" [...] which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material. During writing, Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling. But the final film, with its structure changed by the producers in post-production, has been described by some sources – including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films – as a remake of First Man into Space (1959), another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space. Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight. Sachs, however, had never seen either of those films, and his original screenplay had a very different structure. He had originally written the script for The Incredible Melting Man as a parody of horror films. According to Michael Adams, a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs, this was the reason that the film mixed horror with comedic moments, such as when Steve West's detached ear gets stuck on a tree, and when a janitor sweeps West's melted body into a garbage can {{at the end of the}} film. Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film, including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, [...] "You think we've got trouble, look at that dude". In Sachs' original version, the film opened with the wide-angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway; this would not have been in slow motion, unlike the final film, where the producers played it back slowed down. Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man. All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re-shot during post-production without influence by the director, and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film. There are logical problems in the final film due to the re-shot scenes; it is never fully explained how West's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed.|$|E

6000|$|One evening, {{as he and}} {{his father}} were walking in the garden, the sparrows in the trees above their heads began such a twittering, that they found it {{impossible}} <b>to</b> hear <b>each</b> other speak.

2500|$|Kate Winslet sent {{producer}} Scott Rudin {{the script}} {{and he told her}} that her then husband, director Sam Mendes, would be perfect to direct it. She gave Mendes Yates' novel and told him, [...] "I really want to play this part". He read Haythe's script and then the book in quick succession. Haythe's first draft was very faithful to the novel, using large parts of Yates' own language, but Mendes told him to find ways to externalize what Frank and April do not <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
2500|$|... (2007) Experts {{studied the}} {{protective}} properties of full face masks. The measurements {{showed that the}} workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had something to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other) - and these results were not {{taken into account in}} the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the intercom stations (if necessary).|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E

2500|$|Goforth then {{traveled}} {{to hold a}} series of meetings at the Liaoyang congregation. [...] "The revival at Liaoyang {{was the beginning of a}} movement which spread throughout the whole surrounding country. Bands of revived Christians went here and there preaching the Gospel with telling effect. At one out-station there was a Christian who had a notoriously bad son. During the meetings that were held by one of the revival bands at his village, the young man quite broken up, confessed his sins and came out strongly for Christ. His conversion produced a remarkable effect upon the whole village. Heathen would <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other on the streets: [...] "The Christian's God has come. Why, He has even entered that bad fellow, and driven all the badness out of him. And now he's just like other Christians. So, if you don't want to go the same way you had better keep away from that crowd." [...] " ...|$|E
