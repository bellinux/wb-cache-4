Mango kernel butter extracted from waste seed kernels is a potential additive to cosmetic products or as a cocoa butter substitute. This study determined the pretreatment conditions that produce optimum yield prior to the mechanical extraction <b>of</b> the crude <b>butter.</b> Moreover, this study provided a general <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the finished product. Microwave power (160, 500, and 850 W), microwave exposure time (2. 0, 3. 5, and 5. 0 min), and size levels (1. 5, 3. 0, and 4. 5 mm) were tested for their effects on the yield of the mechanically extracted crude butter in wet basis percentage. The optimization procedures resulted to optimum pretreatment conditions of 160 W, 4. 25 min, and 1. 5 mm. Size level was the most significant factor in the crude <b>butter</b> yield. <b>Sensory</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the crude <b>butter</b> extracted at optimum pretreatment conditions through acceptance test by a test panel resulted to below neutral scores in visual appearance and odor, and above neutral score in texture, indicating the potential <b>of</b> mango <b>butter</b> as a good substitute to cocoa butter in cosmetic products...|$|R
