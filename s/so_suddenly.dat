25|$|Bisociation: This is a {{technical}} term coined by Arthur Koestler. He {{says that a}} funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the punch line, the second level comes up <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only want your best – your money.|$|E
25|$|The {{defect in}} the Prussian {{position}} this respect was subsequently made strikingly manifest {{by the fact that}} the gradual weakening of the Prussian centre for the purpose of reinforcing the right, was closely observed by Napoleon, who took advantage of the insight thus obtained into his opponent's designs, by collecting in rear of the heights of Ligny that force with which, when he saw that the Prussians had no reserve remaining, he <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> assailed and broke the centre of their line.|$|E

Understanding that this dire event meant that the French could spare plenty of soldiers to track down his army, Del Parque bolted to the south, intending to shelter {{in the mountains of}} central Spain. On 25 November, Del Parque slipped away <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> that Kellermann did not even begin his pursuit until the next day.

Less than two weeks after Wellington made these remarks, on 15 November 1830 {{he was forced to}} resign after he was defeated in a motion of no confidence. Sydney Smith wrote, [...] "Never was any administration so completely and <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> destroyed; and, I believe, entirely by the Duke's declaration, made, I suspect, in perfect ignorance of the state of public feeling and opinion."

500|$|The {{reaction}} to the game's cancellation was overwhelmingly negative. Commentators in the industry media felt that the decision was representative of the diminishing relevance of adventure games, with many concluding that LucasArts was moving to maintain its position with low risk Star Wars-themed titles instead of the adventure games that had brought them success in earlier years. Freelance Polices cancellation is often cited as {{the culmination of the}} adventure genre's decline. The decision came <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> that some magazines accidentally published favorable previews of the game after LucasArts' announcement. A fan web site named [...] "Save Sam and Max" [...] presented a petition of 32,000 signatures to LucasArts conveying the fans' disappointment. Steve Purcell, the creator of the Sam & Max franchise, stated that he was disappointed by LucasArts' decision: ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book. Just as we wonder why our feelings change <b>so</b> <b>suddenly,</b> or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August, after {{sighting}} a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant {{ships were}} passed, {{some of them}} close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which were coming in from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. [...] was hit, probably by {{about three or four}} bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving [...] "a great pylon of flame on the sea". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors, and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later it was discovered that Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened <b>so</b> <b>suddenly</b> that Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side. By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to [...] "proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands". After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might be forgiven for not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio.|$|E
