The chamber was irradiated with ^ 241 Am alpha particles. An investigation of multistreamer events in DME due to alpha particles entering the chamber at 20 ^∘ with track length 4 mm gave an estimate of a dead zone, defined as the product of dead length and dead time, to be less than 0. 1 μs·cm. This value is 3 orders of magnitude less than those observed by other groups for noble gases based mixtures. No second streamers were observed with pure isobutane for similar tracks...|$|R

With this study we intend to obtain further information on the photophysical properties of calcein, {{in the presence of}} surfactants and in the concentration range commonly used to investigate the release of such marker from vesicle dispersions. The experiments were carried out both in water and in a physiological buffer (HEPES, pH 7. 5), in the presence of Triton X- 100, sodium dodecyl sulphate and centyltrimethylammonium bromide, both below and above their critical micelle concentration (c. m. c.). The obtained results confirm that calcein flourescence can be affected by the presence of surfactants. Thus, environmental conditions must always be carefully checked for the actual quantitative evaluation of this dye. Furthermore, this study sheds some light on the nature and mechanism of calcein quenching...|$|R

Clear transitions from a proportional to 100 % SQS mode were observed on all three diameter wires with both gases irradiated with alpha particles. Double SQS discharges due to inclined tracks observed in DME gas allowed an estimation of a streamer size along the wire of less than 1 mm. The second SQS discharge appears less than 1 mm from the first within about 500 ns.

The NO 2 pressure was varied between 0. 004 and 0. 080 torr. Measurements were taken {{both in the}} absence of foreign gases and in the presence of up to 30 torr. He, N 2, and O 2 at each NO 2 pressure. In the absence of foreign gases, the <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> follows a Stern-Volmer quenching mechanism, but foreign-gas quenching shows marked deviations from this mechanism. Both from lifetime and kinetic considerations, it is argued that the electronic state formed by absorption of the radiation cannot be the emitting state. Emission occurs from several vibrational levels of the emitting state, the various vibrational levels being formed by collisional cascade reactions. The appropriate quenching rate constant ratios were measured and tabulated. Even the two electronic state mechanism is insufficient to explain all the observations...|$|R
40|$|The photophysical {{properties}} of tris(2, 2 '-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) dichloride (Ru(bpy) 32 +) are dramatically influenced by n-butylammonium salt of alpha-Zirconium phosphate (BAZrP). The metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band at 452 nm is red shifted to 480 nm whereas the emission band at 610 nm is blue shifted to 580 nm when Ru(bpy) 32 + interacts with BAZrP. Blue {{shift in the}} emission band has been observed in ice, and glassy matrices where the rigid environment prevents the relaxation of the MLCT excited state. The interlayer region of BAZrP is rigid due to the hydrophobic butyl amine chains and the ZrP frame-work. So the blue shift in the luminescence spectrum in BAZrP indicates that Ru(bpy) 32 + binds in the interlayer regions. The absorbance and emission spectra of the bound metal complex are independent of the loading. This {{may be due to}} the aggregation of the molecules in the interlayer forming clusters. The excitonic interaction between Ru(bpy) 32 + in the aggregates causes the splitting of the π-π band at 280 nm in the excitation spectra. The luminescence intensity increases upon binding to BAZrP compared to aqueous solution. Time-resolved emission spectra show an emission maxima at 580 nm at all delay times. ^ Deconvolution of the emission data indicates the presence of two components. The major, long lived component (∼ 1500 ns) has been assigned to the species that binds in the interlayer. The luminescence intensities and lifetimes decrease with loading. The <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> rate constant calculated from the Stern-Volmer plots is 5. 8 × 1010 m 2 /mol. s. The enhanced luminescence lifetimes and the increased excited state energy were used to conduct electron transfer experiments in BAZrP using Co(bpy) 33 + as the quencher. Accelerated rate constants (3 ̆e 1. 6 × 1012 m 2 /mol. s) independent of temperature and solvent viscosity was observed. These rate constants are five orders of magnitude faster than diffusion controlled rates. Therefore, rapid migration of the excitation (antenna effect) within the pools has been proposed to explain the large <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> rate constant and the electron transfer rates. ...|$|R

To better assess its selectivity towards bacteria vs. eukaryotic cells, we directly compared CST, its prodrug colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) and polymyxin B (PMB) for bacterial killing, cell toxicity and membrane permeabilization. Methods: Bacterial killing: 4 strains of Psedomonas aeriginosa (P. a.) with distinct resistance phenotypes (See table). Cytotoxicity: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis in murine J 774, human THP- 1 macrophages and porcine renal LLC-PK 1 cells, with drug uptake measured by LC-MS-MS.

40|$|International audienceA {{fluorescence}} microscope {{equipped with a}} condenser for total internal reflection (TIR) illumination was combined with a pulsed laser diode and a time-gated image intensifying camera for fluorescence lifetime measurements of single cells. In particular, fluorescence patterns, decay kinetics, and lifetime images of the lipophilic photosensitizers Foscan® and Foslip were studied in whole cells {{as well as in}} close vicinity to their plasma membranes. Fluorescence lifetimes of both photosensitizers in cultivated HeLa cells decreased from about 8 ns at an incubation time of 3 hours to about 5 ns at an incubation time of 24 hours. This seems to result from an increase in aggregation (or <b>self</b> <b>quenching)</b> of the photosensitizers during incubation. Selective measurements within or in close proximity to the plasma membrane indicate that Foscan® and Foslip are taken up by the cells in a similar way, but may be located in different cellular sites after an incubation time of 24 hours.

40|$|The {{quantum yield}} of photoFries {{rearrangement}} in a polycarbonate film has been analyzed {{as a function}} of temperature and humidity on the basis of previously reported (Koyler and Mann, 1977) experimental data. Results indicate that in the homogeneous amorphous phase, photoFries rearrangement is a concerted process proceeding either from the pi star reversed arrow n singlet, in which case it must be subject to considerable <b>self</b> <b>quenching,</b> or from a triplet, presumably the first triplet since the lifetime of higher triplets is expected to be very short in the solid phase. If the parent excited state is the first triplet, chain scission is possibly an independent process, probably occurring from the pi star reversed arrow n singlet. Evidence of chain scission on photodegradation in the solid state includes loss of C-O and C-C bond intensities revealed in the Fourier transform infrared spectra, gel permeation chromotography elution profiles of degraded film samples dissolved in CHCl 3, and a decrease in tensile strength and T sub g as photodegradation proceeds.

50|$|Synergistic {{catalysts}} {{have been}} used for a variety of reactions, especially when both substrates require some kind of significant activation either with stoichiometric amounts of an activator or through a separate reaction beforehand. Synergistic catalysts differ from other multi-catalyst systems by the nature that one catalyst activates one substrate while the other activates a different substrate. There are other types of multi-catalyst systems such as double activation catalysts where two catalysts are required to activate one substrate or cascade catalysts where one catalyst first transforms a substrate which then is activated by a second catalyst to react.While this field does show particular promise in affording molecules that could not be synthesized under normal synthetic strategies, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. One such issue is <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> of the catalysts with each other.

In the present study, an XeCl laser prototype was used to change the surface morphology of nodular iron samples under high energy ultraviolet exposure. Roughness evolution results from ablation and, above all, from moving of the molten superficial layer, due to both high temperature and pressure involved during the laser shot. Conventional metallography was carried out to determine the mechanisms governing the modification of surface profiles. These were shown to be both a wide and a local phenomena, i. e. involved at two different scales: that of the laser spot {{and that of the}} nodule.

40|$|Time-resolved FTIR {{has been}} used to study the {{emission}} from the NO X 2 Pi (v) products formed both by fluorescence and by collisional <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> of the NO A 2 Sigma+ (v= 0) state. Vibrational excitation has been observed in ground state NO with populations up to at least v= 20. Under conditions where fluorescence is the dominant removal process the nascent distribution in ground state NO(v) was found to be determined by the relative magnitude of the emission coefficients. Collisional quenching by ground state NO populates higher vibrational levels in NO(v) than fluorescence. By comparing distributions acquired at different pressures and by using a surprisal analysis, a nascent distribution of NO(v= 0 - 20) is estimated for collisional relaxation of NO A 2 Sigma+ (v= 0) by NO. This distribution was found to be slightly hotter than statistical (prior) and showed evidence of oscillations at specific vibrational levels.

40|$|When heavy ions collide at ultra-relativistic energy, {{thousands}} of particles are emitted {{and it is}} reasonable to attempt to use hydrodynamic descriptions, with suitable initial conditions, to describe the time evolution of the collisons. In the longitudinal direction pions seem to exhibit Landau flow. This simple model assumes that all the entropy in the collisions is created the instant the two Lorentz contracted nuclei overlap and that the system then expands adiabatically. The system also displays radial and elliptic flow. Radial flow is manifested as a broadening of the pT distributions with respect to pp collisions. It is typically thought to result from multiple scattering of partons or hadrons before dynamic freeze-out. Elliptic flow occurs when heavy ions do not collide exactly head on. The initial geometrical asymetry is translated into a momentum asymetry via pressure gradiants. Since these gradients are <b>self</b> <b>quenching,</b> strong elliptic flow is thought to be linked to early thermalization and a large initial pressure. Using the concept of limiting fragmentation we attempt to sketch a link between the initial and final states of relativistic heavy ion collisions using new preliminary data from the BRAHMS collaboration on elliptic and radial flow.

We have examined the effect of hydrophobic mismatch on the conformation and organization of gramicidin in saturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers of varying thickness utilizing the intrinsic conformation-dependent tryptophan fluorescence. Our results utilizing steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic approaches, in combination with circular dichroism spectroscopy, show that gramicidin remains predominantly in the channel conformation and gramicidin tryptophans are at the membrane interfacial region over a range of mismatch conditions. Interestingly, gramicidin conformation shifts toward non-channel conformations in extremely thick gel phase membranes although it is not excluded from the membrane.

As PDI {{is also known}} to bind various molecules including hormones such as estradiol and thyroxin, we considered the hypothesis that adverse effects of endocrinedisrupter compounds (EDC) could be mediated through their interaction with PDI leading to defects in membrane or secreted proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings: Taking advantage of the recent description of the fluorescence <b>self</b> <b>quenched</b> substrate di-eosin-oxidized-glutathion (DiE-GSSG), we determined kinetically the effects of various potential pharmaceutical EDCs on the in-vitro reductase activity of bovine liver PDI by measuring the fluorescence of the reaction product (E-GSH).

Among them, the wide band gap nanocrystalline materials have opened avenue in fundamental studies and tremendous potential applications in diverse areas such as solar cell, photo-catalysis, sensors, photonic and other optoelectronic devices [4 – 7]. Toward this end, considerable efforts have been devoted on the high temperature synthesis of Cd 1 −xZnxS (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanocrystalline thin films by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and rf-sputtering method [8 – 10], but very less attention is paid toward the low temperature chemical synthesis of high quality water soluble alloy nanocrystals. Nanocrystals synthesized by chemical route gives the chance to control their size, distribution and the most important is to improve the crystallinity by altering the concentration of the reagents and their mixing rate at different temperature [11]. These small-size nanostructures have a large surface to volume ratio, which plays a dominant role in optical properties of the nanostructures. For the good quality nanomaterials, various kinds of capping agents and inorganic shell are used to passivate the undesired sites, which results in the enhancement of luminescence intensity. Doping different activator ions (acts as a recombination center) in these stabilized nanostructures not only gives the chance to obtain required emission color, but it also reduces the <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> by intrinsic defects in the nanocrystals [12]. There are numerous reports on the optical properties of various metal and rare earth ions doped ZnS, CdS, ZnSe, and CdSe nanostructures, but studies on the their doped alloy nanostructures are still very limited [13 – 16]. ZnS nanocrystals doped with Ag ion has been paid a great devotion by several researches because of its commercial application as a blue emitting phosphor [17].

Sixteen cyclometalated platinum complexes have been synthesized with different coordination patterns, which include six complexes with tridentate N^C*N cyclometalating ligands (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18), five complexes with N^N*C cyclometalating ligands (19 a, 19 b, 20 a, 20 b, and 24), three complexes with N^N^C cyclometalating ligands (21 a, 21 b, and 29) and two complexes with tetradentate C^C*N^N cyclometalating ligands (33 and 34). The structures of the platinum complexes 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 a, 19 b, 20 a, 21 a, 21 b, 24, 29, 33, and 39 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In platinum complexes with five-six membered metallacycle (15, 16, 18, 19 a, 19 b, 20 a, 24, and 39), the square geometry of the complexes is improved when {{compared to that of}} platinum complexes with five-five membered metallacycle as the biting angle is increased. The tetradentate coordination (C^C*N^N), square planar geometry of complex 33 are revealed from its X-ray crystal structure. The DFT calculations have been carried out on complexes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 33, and 34 to examine the molecular orbital character of the complexes, which are used in interpreting the electronic spectra of the complexes. The photophysical {{properties of}} the platinum complexes were studied and a majority of the complexes were highly emissive in solution at room temperature. Complex 13 exhibited the highest quantum yield (65 %) among all of the complexes. <b>Self</b> <b>quenching</b> was not observed in a majority of the platinum complexes at lower concentrations. The cytotoxicity (IC₅₀) of the complexes in three lung cancerous cell lines and one prostate cancer cell line were determined by MTT assay.

Part One Thermal dimerization of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene gives 4 : 1 mixtures of endo and exo tricyclo[6. 2. 2. 0 (^ 2, 7) ]dodeca- 4, 9 -diene, 1 and 2. Photosensitized dimerization of cyclohexadiene gives 90 % yields of three products in about 3 : 1 : 1 ratio. The major photodimer {{was shown in}} two ways to be trans-cis-trans-tricyclo[6. 4. 0. 0 (^ 2, 7) ]dodeca- 3, 11 -diene, 3. One of the minor photodimers was shown to be exo-dicyclohexadiene, 2; the other photodimer was assigned the structure cis-cis-cis-tricyclo[6. 4. 0. 0 (^ 2, 7) ]dodeca- 3, 11 -diene, 4. Photodimerization of 2 -cyclohexenone and its photoaddition to cyclohexene are described. The mechanism of the photosensitized dimerization of cyclohexadiene is considered. Quantum yields for the sensitized dimerization are lower than the expected value by varying factors depending upon the particular sensitizer. This effect is interpreted in terms of formation of a sensitizer triple t-cyclohexadiene complex which can break apart either to yield sensitizer ground state plus diene triplet or the ground states of both species. The photoaddition of sensitizers to cyclohexadiene is discussed; it is concluded {{that in some cases}} at least the diene triplet is the reactive intermediate leading to sensitizer-diene adducts. Thermal rearrangements of the dicyclohexadienes are studied. At higher temperatures, 3 rearranges smoothly to give 1 as the only product, and 4 rearranges to give 2. Surprisingly, various catalysts are able to effect the reverse conversions at and below room temperature. Kinetic studies of these rearrangements are described as are heat of combustion measurements which show that the cyclobutanes 3 and 4 are less stable than the thermal dimers 1 and 2. A discussion of the significance of these results is also given. Part Two Reinvestigation of the Hammond-Saltiel description of the photosensitized isomerization of the stilbenes is reported. Most of the gross features of their theory are confirmed but many changes in detail are required by new data. Greater than 5 kcal/mole exothermicity in the energy transfer step is not, as previously reported, sufficient to insure that the process rate is diffusion controlled. A discussion of the meaning of a diffusion controlled process is given. Various factors are considered as possible sources of inefficiency in exothermic energy transfer. Quantum yield measurements for sensitized stilbene isomerization show there is only very limited wastage of quanta. Transfer of energy from sensitizers with triplet energies below 62 kcal/mole to the stilbenes and especially to cis-stilbene is governed not only by the sensitizer triplet energy but also by other factors which are characteristic of the sensitizer. These effects are discussed in terms of energy transfer to cis-stilbene via an intermediate complex of sensitizer triplet and stilbene. Results with sensitizers containing bromine indicate that these substances cause stilbene isomerization by light induced liberation of bromine atoms and not, in general, by electronic energy transfer. This finding casts doubt on some of the evidence adduced in support of nonvertical energy transfer to cis-stilbene. The nature and reactions of stilbene triplets are discussed with special reference to reversible energy transfer to trans-stilbene, azulene <b>quenching</b> effects and <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> due to trans-stilbene. The implications of this study in the study of other photosensitized reactions are presented...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{steadily}} {{growing awareness}} for environmental issues {{caused by the}} increased energy use, mainly in the industrial world. The use of fossil fuels has {{reached the point where}} it can not be looked at as an endless source, the resources are decreasing at a pace where alternative energy sources will be a necessity for this and future generations. Global warming, due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, {{has become one of the}} most important issues on the political agenda at all levels. A widespread opinion is that energy conservation technologies are needed and a shift towards renewable energy sources is required to attain a sustainable development of our society and a progress in the developing countries. This thesis is focusing on two different energy conservation technologies in different applications. The open absorption system, a modification of an absorption heat pump is a promising technique in moist air processes, recovering the latent heat in the air and decreasing the total heat demand. The technology has been tested in two full scale pilot plants at a sawmill operating four timber dryers and another unit installed at an indoor swimming pool. The technique has had positive outcomes in both operational energy conservation respects. It has been shown that the energy demand was decreased considerably in both applications. The investment cost has proved to be relatively high, but optimization of operational parameters shows a potential to decrease the initial investment and make the technology more competitive. Pressurized entrained-flow high temperature black liquor gasification (PEHT- BLG), developed by Chemrec AB, is another novel technique presented in this thesis. Black liquor is an important by-product in the papermaking process. Chemicals and energy is recovered in the conventional recovery boiler where superheated steam is produced to generate electricity and process heat. The cooking chemicals are recovered from the smelt in the bottom of the boiler in a separate recovery cycle. By introducing PEHT-BLG, a synthesis gas is obtained that can be used to generate electricity or be reformed into alternative automotive fuels. A demonstration plant, constructed by Chemrec AB, has been running periodically since late 2005. The plant is located at the Kappa Smurfit mill in conjunction with the Energy Technology Centre in Piteå, Sweden. In this thesis CFD models of the <b>quench</b> and <b>counter</b> current condenser have been performed and presented. The long term objectives with the CFD models are to create a tool that can be an aid in future scale-ups and for optimisation purposes. Since PEHT-BLG enhances the flexibility of the black liquor recovery cycle it is a promising alternative for future industrial commercialization if the remaining issues can be overcome.

40|$|Introduction The Fluorescence Polarization ImmunoAssay (FPIA) is a {{homogeneous}} and very simple method with many {{applications in the}} determination of biologically active compounds. We study and investigate new aproaches, materials and conditions, for further improvement of basic characteristics of the method. The research for optimisation of FPIA {{and the development of}} new systems has been intensified the last years aiming at the application of method in environmental analysis. There are many problems to be solved in this area, taking into account the abundance of toxic substances used and the different requirements of each analytic process. The big variety of samples and the complex matrices, impose sample pretreatment and preconcentration with negative effect to speed and simplicity. Additionally, the homogeneous immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity and cross reactivity with structural related compounds and metabolites. The standard analytical methods used in environmental analysis are chromatographic (HPLC, GC, GC-MS), and include time-consuming steps of extraction, purification concentration and enrichment of samples. These methods are expensive (solvents, standards, operation and service of equipment) and require absolutely specialised personnel. The basic conditions for the widest application of immunoassays in the environmental analysis, in combination with the standard methods, is the development of faster, simpler, reliable and more sensitive assays. The fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA) as {{a homogeneous}} assay can satisfy all these requirements. Further research to improve FPIA is essential in order to meet these conditions. For our studies we used the herbicides 2, 4 -dichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 D) and 2, 4, 5 - trichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2, 4, 5 T) as model antigens. These molecules were the base for synthesis of new tracers and immunogens and we studied their effect in the characteristics of FPIA. The constant increase in sensitivity that was observed, independently from the type of antigen, led to the determination of new conditions and materials that further improve the method. Principle of FPIA FPIA uses two technologies a) the competitive binding of antigen by the antibody and b) the polarisation of fluorescence. FPIA is based on the principle that the molecules of tracer are rotated in solution and their speed of rotation is related with the size of molecules. Free tracer molecules absorb vertical polarized light. Due to their small Molecular Weight and the high speed of rotation, they change orientation and emit unpolarized light (low polarisation of fluorescence). On the contrary, bound tracer molecules by the antibody are turned slowly due to their high Molecular Weight and they emit almost polarized light (high polarisation of fluorescence). The degree of inhibition of the tracer with the presennce of antigen, from the antibody binding sites, and hence the final polarization, depends on the concentration of antigen present in the sample. Experimental part Immunogen synthesis, immunizations - antibodies: Herbicide 2, 4, 5 T were coupled with BSA using as chemical bridge β-alanine or ε-aminocaproic acid. The immunogens 2, 4, 5 Τ-BSA, 2, 4, 5 T- βAla-BSA and 2, 4, 5 T-εAca-BSA were used for immunization of New Zealand rabbits and the IgG fraction was isolated from antiserum with ammonium sulfate. For 2, 4 D assay we used the monoclonal antibody E 2 /G 2 which has been used by others in immunoassays development. Tracer synthesis: Using solid phase chemistry we developed method for hapten synthesis and subsequent preparation of new immunogens and novel tracers. We prepared a series of monolabeled and multilabeled tracers of high purity using as connecting bridge L-lysine molecules in different orientations and FITC. Tracers were isolated with preparative TLC and the structure was confirmed with UV and NMR. We also prepared conventional tracers that are proposed by other researchers and compared with regard to their effectiveness in FPIA. In order to verify our results we synthesized similar tracers using the antigens endosulfan and indomethacin. Implementation of FPIA: The intensity and polarization values was measured in the TDx Abbot analyzer in photocheck mode and the dilution and standard curves were constructed. The sensitivity was estimated with the measurement of the I 50 value (concentration of antigen that gives 50 % reduction in the polarisation of fluorescence) and the limit of detection (the concentration which coresponds 3 SD below the initial polarization). Other characteristics like reproducibility, specificity and recovery were measured in bottled water samples. We also developed and proposed other aproaches like the use of the ratio *B/*F for the construction of standard curves. The measurement of affinity constants between antibody and tracers were used to explain our results. Results - Conclusions Structure of tracers and sensitivity: The use of L-lysine allowed us to synthesize a big variety of monolabeled and multilabeled tracers homologous or heterologous to immunogens. Using these tracers we were able to make a complete study with regard to the influence of their structure in the characteristics of the method. We also studied the relation between their structure and <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> in multilabeled tracers. The results show structure dependent decrease in their quantum yield. The two most important limitations for the use of multilabels in FPIA, is the decrease in quantum yield and the important propeller effect which reduces significantly the polarization. Upon binding of monolabeled tracers by the antibody, appeared fluorescence quenching caused by the interaction of fluorescein with the binding site. The shorter the chemical bridge, the higher the interaction. This reduces propeler effect and increases polarization. The use of L-lysine as chemical bridge resulted in improved tracers especially when the antigen was attached to the α-amino group and the FITC to the ε-amino group of L-lysine (Ag-K(F) -OH). These tracers had better characteristics leading the method to lower detection limits and lower I 50 values, up to nine times, compared to those reported in the literature. The tracer 2, 4 D-K(F) -OH was used in combination with the monoclonal antibody E 2 /G 2 and the I 50 was 12 ng/ml, while in the literature it is reported 80 - 100 ng/ml with the tracer 2, 4 D-EDA-F (ethylene diamine as spacer). The I 50 with isomeric tracer (F-K(2, 4 D) -OH) was measured 93, 5 ng/ml, and with the tracer 2, 4 D-EDA-F which was used by other researchers, was measured 65 ng/ml. Similar results were observed when other antigens (2, 4, 5 T, endosulfan, indomethacin) used for preparation of tracers. From Scatchard analysis we concluded that the affinity of tracer 2, 4 D-K(F) -OH with the antibody was comparable with the affinity for 2, 4 D. On the contrary the affinity of antibody with other tracers was one order of magnitude higher. In conclusion we have found a structure of tracer (Ag-K(F) -OH) which creates conditions for specific recognition by the antibody, thus increasing considerably the assay sensitivity. Other characteristics of the new tracers: The use of new tracers do not influences other characteristics of FPIA like specificity, reproducibility, recovery etc. The percent cross reactivities remain similar with those already reported. The percent coefficient of variation (intra and inter assay) was less than 7 % while the recovery was ranged from 90 - 110 %. The limit of detection was defined at 0, 8 ng/ml. The very well defined structure of tracers and their high purity allowed us easily to calculate the ratio *B/*F (bound tracer / free tracer). Standard curves of *B/*F vs antigen concentration were constructed. The advantages with this approach were: the important reduction and stability of I 50 and the stability of standard curves. The I 50 values were improved at least 3 times and the limit of detection for 2, 4 D was below 0, 35 ng/ml. Antibodies and sensitivity: The above results repeated also with polyclonal antibodies. The influence of immunogen structure was important to the antibody quality. Antibodies with the highest sensitivity correspond to immunogens with the 3 carbon atoms chemical bridge β- alanine. Development of Single - Reagent FPIA The antibody is stabilized when mixed with tracer in working dilution. The mixture is used directly for the implementation of the assay. The antibody - tracer mixture is the single reagent (SR). The standard or unknown sample is added to the SR and the polarization is measured after 5 - 10 min in equilibrium. The SR-FPIA has the following characteristics: a) SR-FPIA is a one step method b) The 30 X concentrated single reagent can be used for at least 4 months and shows increased stability in comparison with its ingredients before mixing c) In all measurements I 50 values was 10 12 ng/ml similar to those obtained with conventional FPIA d) The simplification and the fewer addition steps, reduce the SD values. As a result the limit of detection was reduced further and estimated to be lower than 0, 8 ng/ml. General conclusions Λ The use of solid phase chemistry was proved to be a very useful tool for rapid synthesis of high purity haptens and their use in immunoassays. Λ The negative effect of <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> in multilabels and mainly the propeller effect due to unavoidable long chemical bridges do not allow their use in homogeneous FPIA. Λ The succesfull introduction of L-lysine as chemical bridge led to tracers up to 10 times more sensitive than the conventional ones proposed in the literature. These tracers were recognized specifically by the antibody. Λ Using standard curves with the *B/*F ratio and the single reagent technique the method was simplified and the detection limit of 2, 4 D FPIA was reduced close to the European MRLs.
