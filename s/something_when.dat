5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill <b>something,</b> <b>when</b> we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against <b>something</b> <b>when</b> startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E

500|$|Beitchman notes that, {{throughout}} his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate {{a memory of}} historical events, [...] "since it deludes man into thinking that there was <b>something</b> <b>when</b> there was nothing." [...] Cernat notes: [...] "That which essentially unifies, during , the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to calophile literature, which they perceived as exhausted." [...] In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by Arthur Rimbaud and the Comte de Lautréamont. According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, [...] "the birthright [...] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it [...] "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back." ...|$|E

McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood, writing, [...] "It's something many of us young adults go through and it was nice to see it reflected" [...] in the characters.

500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him <b>something.</b> <b>When</b> Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom—crowded with young people—erupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada has given me the best Christmas present I ever had", while flashing a peace sign.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in Meridian, Mississippi, a {{woman and}} her boyfriend are {{watching}} the television when a news report describes the tornado killing Pinker as it hit the prison. The woman is visibly disturbed by the news. Elsewhere, it is revealed that Pinker is alive and has broken into a clothing store. He is confronted by the strip mall's private security guard and handcuffed. However, Pinker quickly slips out of the handcuffs and escapes, stealing the security guard's car. Later, Mulder inspects the handcuffs and finds that they too have become brittle like the wall at the prison, crumbling into dust. Meanwhile, Pinker begins to ransack the house of an old friend looking for <b>something</b> <b>when</b> the occupant returns. After a brief discussion with Pinker requesting the whereabouts of their mutual ex-girlfriend - the woman from earlier watching the television report - the man pulls a gun. However, as he tries to shoot Pinker, the bullets merely pass through him and Pinker kills him by apparently burning his face off. Mulder and Scully arrive shortly thereafter; Mulder examines the bullets embedded in the wall and finds that they, too, crumble into dust when compressed. [...] He muses that Pinker, after being struck by lightning, must have developed the ability to pass through solid objects. Scully argues that Pinker cannot possibly defy the laws of chemistry.|$|E

The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to <b>something.</b> <b>When</b> the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
