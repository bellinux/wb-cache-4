50|$|The asphere's {{more complex}} surface profile can reduce or {{eliminate}} spherical aberration and also reduce other optical aberrations such as astigmatism, compared to a simple lens. A single aspheric lens can often replace a much more complex multi-lens system. The resulting device is smaller and lighter, and sometimes cheaper than the multi-lens design. Aspheric elements {{are used in the}} design of multi-element wide-angle and fast normal lenses to reduce aberrations. They are also used in combination with reflective elements (catadioptric systems) such as the aspherical Schmidt corrector plate used in the <b>Schmidt</b> <b>cameras</b> and the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes.

Common general-purpose telescopes have small plate scale and employ large integration times, what plays against meteor detection.

50|$|Astronomical {{photography}} {{is one of}} the earliest types of scientific photography and almost from its inception it diversified into subdisciplines that each have a specific goal including star cartography, astrometry, stellar classification, photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry, and the discovery of astronomical objects such as asteroids, meteors, comets, variable stars, novae, and even unknown planets. These all require specialized equipment such as telescopes designed for precise imaging, for wide field of view (such as <b>Schmidt</b> <b>cameras),</b> or for work at specific wavelengths of light. Astronomical CCD cameras may use cryogenic cooling to reduce thermal noise and to allow the detector to record images in other spectra such as in infrared astronomy. Specialized filters are also used to record images in specific wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} current status of a program to develop far- and middle-ultraviolet-sensitive {{electrographic}} detectors. These include large-format, semitransparent-photocathode detectors and opaque-photocathode electrographic <b>Schmidt</b> <b>cameras.</b> Modifications of a previously-demonstrated far-UV large-format detector to make it suitable for possible Shuttle/Spacelab space astronomy investigations have been implemented and tested. Middle-ultraviolet-sensitive large-format and Schmidt electrographic detectors are now in the laboratory development stage. Cesium telluride photocathodes are used to provide sensitivity in the 1700 - 3100 A spectral range, and techniques for processing these photocathodes are discussed. The preparation and use of polyimide barrier membranes, for protecting the photocathodes from deterioration by film outgassing, are described. A new opaque-photocathode vacuum-ultraviolet-sensitive electrographic detector has been demonstrated, which is based on an oblique-focusing electron optical system similar to that used by Princeton with electron-bombarded CCD arrays. Test results and potential applications of this detector are described...|$|R
40|$|The Tactical Imaging Experiment and Demonstration System (TIDES) goal is {{to develop}} a small imaging {{satellite}} for tactical applications where the field commander controls the satellite and achieves a launch on demand at a reasonable cost.

Innovations such as Vector Quantization (VQ) technology with a new developed codebook processing chip (CPC) demonstrates the ability to compress images at ratios of 12 to 1 or greater reducing satellite to ground datalink bandwidth, on-board storage and power while producing images of high quality. The satellite and payload designs contain no moving parts: achieving high reliability, low cost and requiring minimal operational support. The mobile ground station permits operations from any location and can be operated by a single operator with minimum technical training and expertise.

50|$|<b>Schmidt</b> <b>cameras</b> {{have very}} {{strongly}} curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In {{some cases the}} detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed {{to the shape of}} the focal plane through the use of retaining clips or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum. A field flattener, in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate {{is at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.|$|R

40|$|We report {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} massive investigation of the striation patterns observed in the dust tail of comet Hale-Bopp in March and April 1997. Our findings are based on 16 wide-field photographs taken with <b>Schmidt</b> <b>cameras</b> on March 2 - 20, with six more, from March 31 -April 8, still waiting for analysis. Altogether approximately 700 individual striae were examined on the 16 images, which were scanned and computer processed to enhance the morphology. About 5300 stria points, or some 7 - 8 points per stria per image on the average, were measured and their astrometric positions determined and subsequently converted to a Cartesian coordinate system, aligned with the comet's projected radius vector and centered on the nucleus. The evolution of the striated tail has been studied using the Sekanina-Farrell fragmentation hypothesis (AJ 85, 1538, 1980), previously applied to other comets.
