40|$|The spent {{mushroom}} substrate (SMS) of Lentinula edodes {{that was}} derived from <b>sawdust</b> <b>bag</b> cultivation was used as materials for controlling Phytophthora blight disease of pepper. Water extract from SMS (WESMS) of L. edodes inhibited mycelial growth of Phytophthora capsici, suppressed Phytophthora blight disease of pepper seedlings by 65 % and promoted growth of the plant over 30 %. In high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, oxalic acid was detected as the main organic acid compound in WESMS and inhibited the fungal mycelium at a minimum concentration of 200 mg/l. In quantitative real-time PCR, the transcriptional expression of CaBPR 1 (PR protein 1), CaBGLU (β- 1, 3 -glucanase), CaPR- 4 (PR protein 4), and CaPR- 10 (PR protein 10) were significantly enhanced on WESMS and DL-β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) treated pepper leaves. In addition, the salicylic acid content was also increased 4 to 6 folds in the WESMS and BABA treated pepper leaves compared to water treated leaf sample. These findings suggest that WESMS of L. edodes suppress Phytophthora blight disease of pepper through multiple effects including antifungal activity, plant growth promotion, and defense gene induction...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{aeration}} through lid filters on the hyphal growth of Lentinula edodes (oak mushroom) in <b>sawdust</b> cultivation <b>bags</b> were investigated. The aeration treatment levels were traditional 27 mm hole cotton plugs, cotton balls and combinations of seven hole sizes × two hole positions (up and under) in the lids covering plastic bags containing 1. 4 kg sawdust medium at 63 % moisture {{that had been}} autoclaved for one hour and inoculated with sawdust spawn of L. edodes strain 921. Aeration treatment effects were measured based on the CO 2 concentration at the 15 th wk, {{as well as the}} hyphal growth rate and degree of weight loss of bags every 14 days for 15 wk. In bags with traditional cotton plugs, the CO 2 concentration was 3. 8 ± 1. 3 %, daily mean hyphal growth was 2. 3 ± 0. 6 mm and daily mean weight loss was 0. 84 ± 0. 26 g. In the bags with 15 mm diameter holes, the CO 2 concentration was 6. 0 ± 1. 6 %, daily hyphal growth was 2. 8 ± 0. 2 mm and daily weight loss was 0. 86 ± 0. 4 g. The bags with 15 mm holes had a higher CO 2 concentration and lower water loss than bags with other hole sizes, but the hyphal growth was not significantly different from that of other bags. The weight loss of bags increased proportionally relative to the lid hole sizes. Taken together, these results indicate that traditional cotton plugs are eco-nomically efficient, but 15 mm hole lids are the most efficient at maintaining hyphal growth and controlling water loss while allowing CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{strain of}} Pleurotus ostreatus was cultivated on rice straw and <b>sawdust</b> in plastic <b>bags.</b> Lignin biodegradation {{appeared to be}} doubled in case of sawdust (36 %) compared with rice straw (18 %). However, hemicellulose and cellulose degradation were faster in case of rice straw (66. 6 %), (31. 2 %) than saw dust (60. 0 %), (18. 2 %), respectively. Free sugars appeared to be used variably during Pleurotus ostreatus growth and residual sugars as well as total protein were considerably accumulated after fruiting. In spite of fruiting of Pleurotus ostreatus on rice straw was earlier than sawdust; however, the levels of enzyme production and activities including; exoglucanase, endoglucanase, CMCase and pectinase appeared to be higher in case of using sawdust than rice straw in both of two stages namely; mycelial and fruiting stages. On contrary, xylanase showed early rate of higher production of enzyme activity on sawdust (21. 0 I U g - 1) during mycelial growth then sharply decreased at fruiting stage (11. 0 I U g - 1). In addition Mn-peroxidase (MnPase) activity {{was more or less}} equal on both of the two wastes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Horticultural {{production}} {{in most parts}} of the tropics is extremely difficult due to high rate of infection by the soil-borne diseases. At the moment, utilization of hydroponics systems for the commercial production of crops is very limited. This study, therefore, attempted to investigate the potential of growing gypsophila using different hydroponics systems. The experiments were laid out in a split-plot design. Three hydroponics systems were used as the main plots, i. e. elevated tray, ground lay bed and bag culture systems. The sub-plots were allocated to three different aggregate/medium components, i. e., sawdust, river sand and vermiculite. Throughout the production period, plants grown using river sand had the lowest plant height. The highest plant height (52. 9 cm) was obtained from plants grown in vermiculite at 12 weeks after transplanting (WAT). Plant height of gypsophila plants grown using sawdust at 12 WAT was almost double that of those grown using sand. There was a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in number of shoots/plant in gypsophila grown in sand medium in all three hydroponics systems. The highest number of shoots/plant was obtained from plants grown in sawdust in all hydroponics systems. The highest cut flower stem length (67. 0 cm) was obtained from plants grown in <b>sawdust</b> in the <b>bag</b> culture hydroponics system, while the lowest cut flower stem length (25. 0 cm) was observed in plants grown in sand in the elevated tray hydroponics system. The highest number of branches/plant was generally observed in plants grown in the bag culture hydroponics system when compare...|$|R
