5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When <b>summoned,</b> <b>the</b> Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is <b>summoned,</b> <b>the</b> player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} convention agreed on dissolving the Youth of the Progress Party, with 63 against 21 votes.

5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> pair to his office and told them to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Christian {{rulers of}} Syria and the Holy Land to Cyprus. Bohemond joined him while Frederick was marching from Limassol to Nicosia in August 1228. Frederick demanded an oath of fealty for Antioch and Tripoli from Bohemond, but Bohemond feigned a nervous {{breakdown}} and returned to Nephin. Bohemond again met Frederick in Acre in 1229, but Bohemond's realms {{were not included in}} the peace treaty between Frederick and Al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, on 18 February 1229.|$|E
5|$|The decision, while widely {{praised by}} foreign intellectuals and politicians, was {{attacked}} by the Chinese government and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also denounced the award and what they regarded as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China—on the Internet, television, and in print media. The government strongly denounced the award, and <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest. The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate. Liu's wife was put under house-arrest before {{the decision of the}} Nobel Committee was announced.|$|E

5|$|After the Treaty of Ryswick ended {{war between}} the French and English in 1697, the French {{continued}} to make war on the Iroquois (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. The Iroquois sought {{the assistance of the}} English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help. Bellomont and French Governor General Louis-Hector de Callière both claimed dominance over the Iroquois, and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf. When Callière <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois to Montreal for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan. The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|During {{his short}} reign the Byzantine emperor Alexander (r. 912–913) {{provoked}} {{a conflict with}} the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927). Simeon I, who had long harboured ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself, {{took the opportunity to}} wage war. With the Byzantine Empire in disarray following Alexander's death in June 913, the Bulgarians reached Constantinople unopposed and forced the regency of the infant Constantine VII (r. 913–959) to recognize Simeon I as emperor (in Bulgarian, Tsar). Following a palace coup in 914, the new Byzantine regency revoked the concessions to the Bulgarians and <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> whole army, including the troops in Asia Minor, to deal with the Bulgarian threat once and all. In the decisive battle of Achelous in 917 the Byzantine forces were completely annihilated, leaving the Bulgarians in charge of the Balkans. Their annual campaigns reached the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth. All subsequent attempts to confront the Bulgarian army at Katasyrtai, Aquae Calidae and Pegae ended in defeat.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{marriage}} to Louis was celebrated in Buda on 20 June 1353. The couple were related within the prohibited degree of kinship, Duke CasimirI of Kuyavia being Elizabeth's maternal great-great-grandfather and Louis' maternal great-grandfather. A papal dispensation was thus necessary, {{but it was}} only sought four months after the wedding took place. The historian Iván Bertényi suggests that the ceremony may have been hastened by an unintended pregnancy, as the couple had been in contact for years. If so, the pregnancy likely ended in a stillbirth. Elizabeth's mother had apparently died {{by the time she was}} married. Louis was dismayed when, upon his father-in-law's death later the same year, Elizabeth's young and ambitious cousin Tvrtko ascended the Bosnian throne. In 1357, Louis <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> young Ban to Požega and compelled him to surrender most of western Zachlumia as Elizabeth's dowry.|$|E
5|$|However, John I {{married a}} {{daughter}} of Sigismund I of Poland, Isabella, who in 1540 bore him a son. Already dying, the king took an oath from his barons to evade the treaty of Oradea, and his counselor, George Martinuzzi, had the infant John II Sigismund elected as king (15401571). Ferdinand I sent troops to take Buda, but they withdrew upon the advance of the Ottoman army. On August 29, 1541 Suleiman I <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian lords to his camp, and while the reception was taking place, his troops occupied {{the capital of the}} kingdom. At the same time the sultan assigned the territories of the kingdom east of the Tisa to Queen Isabella and her son in return for an annual tribute.|$|E

5|$|In 1538 James V <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Earl of Morton {{before the}} Privy Council, {{accusing him of}} non-payment of his feudal dues, and in 1540 he banished the Earl to Inverness. Morton reached Brechin, in Angus, where he signed a deed resigning his lands to his kinsman Robert Douglas of Lochleven. Lochleven was {{compelled}} to resign the lands in turn to James V, although he was permitted to keep Aberdour Castle. After James V's death in late 1542, George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Arran assisted Morton in reclaiming his lands, including Aberdour. In return their sons were to marry two of Morton's three daughters. Pittendreich's son James (1525-1581) married the heiress, Elizabeth, and succeeded, in 1553, as 4th Earl of Morton.|$|E
5|$|In 1540 Montejo the Elder, {{who was now}} in {{his late}} 60s, turned his royal rights to {{colonise}} Yucatán over to his son, Francisco Montejo the Younger. In early 1541 Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the Younger <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the Younger remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Most notably, from 313 to 316 {{bishops in}} North Africa {{struggled}} with other Christian bishops {{who had been}} ordained by Donatus in opposition to Caecilian. The African bishops could not come to terms and the Donatists asked Constantine {{to act as a}} judge in the dispute. Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the Donatism movement in North Africa. In 317 Constantine issued an edict to confiscate Donatist church property and to send Donatist clergy into exile. More significantly, in 325 he <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of Jerusalem is so classified), most known for its dealing with Arianism and for instituting the Nicene Creed.|$|E

5|$|On 17 October 1820, news arrived {{that the}} {{military}} garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to {{what became known as}} the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by JoãoVI, and <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> Cortes—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: JoãoVI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the Council of State.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> German {{ambassador}} Viktor von Heeren {{and handed}} him a statement which declared that the new government would accept all its international obligations, including accession to the Tripartite Pact, {{as long as the}} national interests of the country were protected. Von Heeren returned to his office to discover a message from Berlin instructing that contact with Yugoslav officials was to be avoided, and he was recalled to Berlin. No reply was given to Ninčić. On 2 April orders were issued for the evacuation of the German embassy, and the German chargé d'affaires advised the diplomats of friendly countries to leave the country.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, when President Lincoln {{called for}} 75,000 troops in {{response}} to the attack on Fort Sumter, the 5th Massachusetts was ordered by Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew to prepare for active service in the field. Andrew dispatched four regiments on April 17 and 18, holding the 5th Massachusetts in reserve for the time being. On April 19, pro-secessionist rioters in Baltimore attacked the 6th Massachusetts as that regiment attempted to make their way to Washington. Alarmed by the escalation in violence, Andrew <b>summoned</b> <b>the</b> 5th Massachusetts to Boston to prepare for departure. The first companies arrived in Boston that same day on April 19. By April 20 the remaining companies reported and the regiment was prepared to depart. That night, the unit barracked in Faneuil Hall and departed for Virginia on April 21, 1861.|$|E
