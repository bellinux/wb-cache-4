5|$|The {{large number}} of goals created a {{confusion}} over the correct <b>scoreline.</b> At {{the end of the}} match, the scoreboard at the stadium showed 32–0 and Thompson was credited with 14 goals. After the statistician did a recount, the 31–0 <b>scoreline</b> was announced, and Thompson's total goals count was reduced to 13. After the match, FIFA went on to release the official statistics after receiving the official report from the referee and match officials, which confirmed the 31–0 <b>scoreline</b> and Thompson's 13 goals.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the first-half, it was Alavés who started the half the better of the two sides. Contra put a cross from {{the right side of}} the pitch into the penalty area, which was met by Moreno, whose header beat Westerveld to make the <b>scoreline</b> 3–2. Four minutes later Alavés had equalised. They were awarded a free-kick 25 yards away from goal and Moreno went straight through the Liverpool wall and into the goal past Westerveld. Liverpool reacted to the <b>scoreline</b> being levelled at 3–3 by substituting Stéphane Henchoz with Vladimír Šmicer. Steven Gerrard was placed in the right-back position as a result of the change. Three minutes later, Owen was brought down by defender Antonio Karmona, who was subsequently booked. Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, which Gary McAllister hit into the Alavés wall. In the 64th minute, both sides made substitutions. Liverpool replaced Emile Heskey with Robbie Fowler, while Alavés goalscorer Javi Moreno with Pablo.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} season with Bordeaux, Chamakh was equally adept {{in both the}} league and the Champions League. He began the season {{claiming}} his fifth trophy on 25 July 2009 as Bordeaux won the 2009 Trophée des Champions in a 2–0 victory over Guingamp. Chamakh scored ten goals in league play and netted five in the Champions League, which included goals against Italian club Juventus and German club Bayern Munich in the group stage. Bordeaux were only one of two clubs to finish the group-stage portion undefeated. In the knockout rounds, Chamakh scored a goal in Bordeaux's 2–1 victory over Greek club Olympiacos in the second leg of the team's UEFA Champions League opening knockout round match. Bordeaux won the tie with a 3–1 aggregate <b>scoreline</b> {{to advance to the}} quarter-finals, where they faced league rivals Lyon. In the first leg, which Lyon won 3–1, Chamakh scored a vital away goal. In the second leg, Chamakh converted another goal to get the <b>scoreline</b> 3–2 on aggregate. In the second half, however, Bordeaux were unable to score another as Lyon advanced to the semi-finals on the aggregate <b>scoreline.</b> In Ligue 1, Chamakh appeared in all 38 matches {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite starting the campaign strong, Bordeaux fell out of the running for the league title in the spring and eventually finished the season in sixth place, failing to qualify for European competition next season.|$|E

5|$|Newspaper {{headlines}} in most World Cup nations trumpeted the shocking upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There {{was only one}} American journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper {{to pay for the}} trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat by the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 <b>scoreline</b> was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a <b>scoreline</b> of 10–0 or 10–1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story is a myth.|$|E
5|$|Rovers won {{once again}} in an away game against Upton Park at West Ham Park by a <b>scoreline</b> of 3–0 in the fifth round. The match was more {{competitive}} than the <b>scoreline</b> might suggest, as Blackburn were a goal down at half time but won the game after a goal by John Inglis and two by Joe Lofthouse in the second half. At Birmingham in a neutral venue, they defeated Notts County in the semi-final 1–0. As with Olympic against Queen's Park, Notts also complained of events that took place during their semi-final. They argued that Rovers had illegally fielded Inglis, a player from Glasgow who had played for Rangers and was only drafted it to the Blackburn team to improve their cup performance. A letter was produced by Rovers {{to show that he}} had been expelled from Rangers because he continued to play for the English team instead. Notts wanted the match to be replayed without Inglis, but the FA did not uphold the complaint.|$|E

50|$|The Roosters {{beat the}} Wests Tigers twice in 2004 by <b>scorelines</b> of 22-0 and 56-0 in Rounds 9 and 16 respectively. It {{was the first}} time in almost 40 years that a single team had held their {{opponent}} scoreless over two matches.|$|R
5|$|The {{national}} team's {{record for}} highest-scoring victory was achieved in 2016, a 10–0 result over San Marino. Croatia's worst defeat {{is a joint}} record; the Independent State of Croatia side lost 5–1 to Germany twice in the 1940s. The modern Croatian team also lost to England by the same <b>scoreline</b> in a 2010 World Cup qualifying fixture in London.|$|E
5|$|When Liverpool and Newcastle met {{each other}} at Anfield on 11 March 1997 during the 1996–97 season, the <b>scoreline</b> was {{identical}} {{to that of the}} 3 April 1996 match. Liverpool, however, were 3–0 up before the half-time interval, with goals scored by McManaman, Fowler and Patrick Berger. Newcastle scored three goals in 17 minutes before Fowler scored his second goal of the match in stoppage time.|$|E

This was Liverpool's second appearance in the European Cup: they had reached the semi-finals during the 1964–65 season, losing to eventual winners Internazionale. Their opponents in the first round were Petrolul Ploiești of Romania, whom they beat 2–0 in a play-off match after the two-leg tie resulted in a 3–3 <b>scoreline.</b>|$|E

50|$|Priestley's last {{win against}} Taylor {{came in a}} non-televised ranking event in 2006.

5|$|Alloa led {{the match}} 2–1 at half-time {{but only two}} minutes after the {{interval}} both teams scored to make it 3–2 by the 47th minute. Paul Sheerin scored a second penalty for Inverness in the 56th minute to make the score 3–3 which is how the <b>scoreline</b> remained after 90 minutes, which forced an additional 30 minutes of extra time to be played. Martin Cameron scored his second goal for Alloa in the 104th minute to take a 4–3 lead but was cancelled out when Sheerin completed a hat-trick of goals for Inverness to make it 4–4 and take the game to penalties. Alloa Athletic emerged victorious after winning the shoot-out 5–4.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} Football League Cup {{in the third}} round, where they were drawn away to Sunderland. A 3–0 victory meant they progressed to the fourth round, where they beat First Division club Reading by an {{identical}} <b>scoreline.</b> Extra time and penalties was required in Arsenal's fifth round tie against Doncaster Rovers, after a 2–2 draw in 90 minutes. Two saves by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia helped Arsenal win 3–1 on penalties and reach the semi-finals of the competition {{for the first time}} since 1998. They faced Wigan Athletic, losing 1–0 in the first leg and in spite of winning the second leg 2–1 with a full strength team, Arsenal was eliminated on aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the Third Round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Chelsea's matches ranged from comfortable victories to close affairs. They beat Tottenham Hotspur 5–1 in the semi-final, while they beat Queens Park Rangers 1–0 in the Fourth Round. Liverpool's matches were similar, with three ending in a 2–1 <b>scoreline,</b> while the other two against Oldham Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion were won by at least four goals.|$|E

Those wonderings mostly appeared due to the tightness and even <b>scorelines</b> of the quarter final games.|$|R
