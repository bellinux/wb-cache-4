5|$|In September 1944, the 27th Battalion was {{deployed}} to Green Island where they relieved the American troops defending Lagoon Airfield. The Americans were subsequently re{{deployed to}} the fighting in the Philippines. In 1945, the battalion moved to Bougainville {{to take part in}} the Australian campaign there. Initially, it was tasked with relieving the 55th/53rd Battalion at Laruma River in the central <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, which it did so in March. In April, the battalion pressed on to Pearl Ridge where they took over from the 31st/51st Battalion and began to carry out patrols in front of the ridge. Over the course of six weeks, the battalion carried out a number of minor attacks and in the process captured several key features before moving to the northern <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island on the Bonis Peninsula around Ratsua where they continued to harass Japanese forces through active patrolling and ambushing. This continued until the end of the war in August 1945.|$|E

5|$|About 19:00 on 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} {{with a few}} tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. They quickly overcame {{the resistance of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, who were affected by Ustaše propaganda. The Yugoslavs abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska had mobilised in Bjelovar and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. That night, Croat members of that regiment revolted, arresting their Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front in mid-October.

Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} was serious enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945.

5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo. This move to Cairo was to {{enable him to}} be in a more central position to carry out his duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt's Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A. Lawrence, who had been in command of the Northern <b>Sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal defences and Romani during the battle, was transferred to the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridgehead {{against which the}} 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
