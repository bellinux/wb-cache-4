5|$|Within the government, Van der Byl {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices urging Ian Smith to proceed to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He angrily denounced the threat of {{sanctions}} from Britain, <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> 4 May 1965 that economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition. Van der Byl was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the UDI government. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 October and so was present at, but did not sign, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965.|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands adopted {{shareholders}}’ <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay over {{a decade}} ago. The general meeting of shareholders must approve the remuneration policy and any amendments to it. This Dutch approach offers fruitful insights into how <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay works in practice. In {{the light of the}} recent European proposal to introduce a uniform <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay, we examine the merits of the Dutch system. First, we describe the legal framework of the Dutch <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay and its background. Then, using hand-collected voting data, information from the minutes of general meetings and ownership data for the entire Dutch <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay period (2004 – 2014), we address and discuss both its direct and its indirect effects. Our study shows that, although remuneration proposals are seldom rejected, the influence of shareholders on the remuneration policy of the company is considerable. Furthermore, the Dutch approach to <b>say</b> <b>on</b> pay stimulates shareholders’ dialogue and increases pressure on boards regarding remuneration matters, even in the presence of large insider shareholders...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} increasing shareholder “voice ” in corporations through a new governance rule that provides shareholders with a regular vote <b>on</b> pay: <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay. We apply a regression discontinuity design to <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay shareholder proposals to deal with prior expectations and the endogeneity of internal governance rules. Adopting <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay leads to large increases in market value (5. 4 percent), firm profitability, and long-term performance. In contrast, we find small effects on the level and structure of pay. This suggests that <b>Say</b> <b>on</b> Pay operates as a regular confidence vote, increasing efficiency, and market value...|$|R

Meier also blamed Dahl's alcoholism and unpredictable behavior.

Consequently, Gillard's move against Rudd on 23 June appeared to surprise many Labor backbenchers. Daryl Melham, when asked by a reporter {{on the night of the}} challenge if indeed a challenge was on, replied: [...] "Complete garbage. ABC have lost all credibility."

Wanderone is remembered for <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg."

[...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E

[...] "We will be doing a sequel to Heathers next", Ryder stated. [...] "There's Heathers in the real world! We have to keep going!"

[...] Dunne has also used his music to criticise quick time events in his Resident Evil 6 song [...] "Wigglesticks".

They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation." ...|$|E

500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace {{for more than a year}} now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... We have decided to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> it".

500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library.

[...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> its 25th anniversary, [...] "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} of my mind, not the mind of a child." ...|$|E

Heartbreak" [...] at a concert in Washington D.C.. On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, [...] "the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel", and that he admired him [...] "Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R and rhythmic music". Usher's Live album would feature a medley performance of Brown's original singles - [...] "Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha", and [...] "Roni". Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra's My Way album released in 1969 {{so much that he}} decided to name his sophomore album My Way. Prince would inspire [...] "Nice & Slow" [...] while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher {{said in an interview with}} Sway Calloway; [...] "the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> his records it motivated methere'd been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his".|$|E
500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond", while <b>saying</b> <b>on</b> another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
