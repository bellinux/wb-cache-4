5|$|Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra {{were cast}} in the lead roles. Aishwarya Rai was {{originally}} offered the lead role, but she refused it because <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to end up with}} another man in her first film with her husband (Bachchan) after their marriage. After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to reconcile the}} two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off {{during the process of}} elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to teach traditional home economics principles if {{they could not be}} supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to be like}} either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, {{as much as she}} fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want,</b> to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets {{in the hands of a}} trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|Oddr Snorrason has an {{elaborate}} {{account of the}} problems arising from Thyri's marriages. He tells us that she was betrothed and married to the Wendish king Burislav, who received a large dowry for her; but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be his wife and starved herself after their wedding, so Burislav sent her back to Denmark. She then arranged to have herself married to Olaf Tryggvason, to the displeasure of her brother Svein. Svein's queen, Sigrid the Haughty, a staunch opponent of Olaf, egged Svein to make war on him. Svein then conspired with Jarl Sigvaldi and King Olaf of Sweden to lure Olaf Tryggvason into a trap. Olaf Tryggvason travelled to Wendland to collect Thyri's dowry from King Burislav and while there heard rumours of a planned ambush; but Sigvaldi arrived to tell him these rumours were false. Believing Sigvaldi, Olaf sent most of his fleet home, as his men were impatient. He therefore had only a small fleet left when he was ambushed near Svolder.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert {{is in love with}} him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E
50|$|Henrietta is an {{independent}} woman that is getting around mostly on her own, despite {{growing up in a}} sheltered life where <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have much to worry about. She is able to observe everything around her, and infer what a woman's role in society is and what is expected of her. Henrietta is concerned about the idea of having to 'marry a man' and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be forced into something <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do.</b> This should <b>not</b> be confused with <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> to be married at all, throughout the book she is never insinuating <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to marry period, but that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be forced into something she has not chosen. This is an important distinction since almost all women of status were 'forced' into a marriage, whether they were happy about it or not. It was not their choice based on love, it was a usually a choice made by a father or older brother in order to further advance their family, or business.|$|R

5000|$|... "Break Down Here" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad centralizing on the narrator, who {{is driving}} by {{herself on the}} freeway, {{escaping}} a failed relationship with all of her belongings {{in the back of}} the vehicle. Realizing that her vehicle is beginning to make a noise and that she is far from an exit, she states that she would [...] "sure hate to break down here". The phrase has a double meaning, in that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the vehicle to break down, and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to break down and cry ("I've made it this far without crying a single tear").|$|R
5|$|Chad Harris-Crane first {{appears in}} the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after {{discovering}} he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married Latoya Harris while he {{was working as a}} music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people with information on his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with Crane Industries CEO Julian Crane and claims to have evidence proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite Sheridan Crane, before she can deliver it to him.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted {{to spend more time with}} her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E
