40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the use of the definite and indefinite articles in the <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> spoken in Friuli and in colloquial Slovene. As regards the definite article one encounters a highly homogeneous situation: the process of grammaticalization seems to have been completed everywhere and the form expresses, with a certain degree of variation, all functions that are usually present in languages that posses such an article. Another picture emerges for the indefinite article: whereas in the <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> spoken in Friuli grammaticalization is almost total (expressing specific, non specific and generic functions), in <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> that are geographically distant from the contact zone with Romance only and exclusively the specific function is expressed...|$|R

50|$|In {{view of this}} extreme {{development}} on both sides, the atmosphere between the two national groups was extremely tense {{after the war and}} the Slovene language continued to retreat steadily despite {{the fact that in the}} mixed-language areas every schoolchild now had to undergo bilingual instruction.

50|$|The {{following}} {{grouping of}} dialects and subdialects {{is based on}} the 1983 map of <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> by Fran Ramovš, Tine Logar, and Jakob Rigler (sl) (from which the first Slovene term listed in parentheses is taken) and other sources.|$|R
5000|$|Valentin [...] "Tine" [...] Logar (11 February 1916 [...] - [...] December 25, 2002) was a Slovenian {{historical}} linguist, dialectologist, {{and university}} professor.

50|$|<b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> (slovenska narečja) are the {{regional}} spoken varieties of Slovene, a South Slavic language. Spoken Slovene is often {{considered to have}} at least 48 dialects (narečja) and subdialects (govori). The exact number of dialects is open to debate, ranging from as many as 50 to merely 7. The various dialects are so different from each other that a speaker of one dialect may have a very difficult time understanding a speaker of another, particularly if they belong to different regional groups. Speakers of dialects that strongly differ accommodate each other by gravitating toward standard <b>Slovene.</b> <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects</b> are part of the South Slavic dialect continuum, transitioning into Serbo-Croatian to the south and bordering Friulian and Italian to the west, German to the north, and Hungarian to the east.|$|R

50|$|In addition, Resian has {{maintained}} a number of archaisms (including the aorist) that have disappeared both in standard Slovene and most other <b>Slovene</b> <b>dialects.</b> Atypical for a Slavic language, Resian has a definite article: masculine te, feminine ta (the only standard Slavic languages to contain definite articles are Bulgarian and Macedonian).|$|R
50|$|The dialects of Serbo-Croatian {{include the}} {{regional}} varieties of Serbo-Croatian {{as a whole}} {{or as part of}} its standard varieties: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian.
