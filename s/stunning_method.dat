40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify whether non-focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with an adapted coil for broilers {{has the potential for}} use as a non-invasive <b>stunning</b> <b>method</b> for broilers. Application of the TMS probe resulted in dominance of theta and delta waves and appearance of spikes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) after stimulation. Correlation dimension (CD) analyses of the EEG signals recorded prior to and following the application of TMS suggested that the birds might be unconscious for approximately 15 to 20 s assuming that a reduction in CD to 60 % of the baseline value indicates unconsciousness. Other observations included loss of behavioural arousal or muscle tone (muscle flaccidity), and irregular heart rate after TMS. It can be suggested that TMS {{has the potential to be}} developed as a <b>stunning</b> <b>method</b> in the future. The technique, evaluated using small number of broilers in this study, requires further improvement and the use of a power supply optimised in future research.

Broilers (n = 72) were stunned using an electrical saline stunner (35 mA, 7 s) or a shackle-line carbon dioxide gas stunning tunnel (15 to 40 % CO 2 gradient for 90 s). After bleeding for 90 s, the broilers were scalded with a soft scald (53 C for 120 s) or a softer scald (53 C for 90 s). Within 2 min after scalding, feathers from the right femoral feather tract were removed perpendicularly using a force gauge to evaluate FRF.

40|$|The general <b>method</b> for <b>stunning</b> poultry before {{slaughter}} is by immersion of a chicken's {{head into}} an electrified waterbath. This method results in carcass and meat quality deficiencies. The major problems are hemorrhages and {{a delay in}} onset of rigor mortis, which {{increases the risk of}} cold shortening with early deboning. In two experiments, this study examines the early postmortem metabolism in the breast muscle and its effect on ultimate meat quality. The first experiment describes the effects of 5 h feed deprivation on the availability of glycogen from the liver and the breast muscle, of waterbath and head-only electrical stunning on pH and metabolite levels up to 6 h in unprocessed muscle, and the consequences on meat quality. The second experiment compares the same measurements after waterbath and head-only electrical stunning, CO(2) /O(2) /N(2) and Ar/CO(2) gases, and captive needle stunning. Metabolic degradation halted after 6 h without processing or after 4 h under conventional conditions after waterbath and CO(2) /O(2) /N(2) stunning.

40|$|Electrical {{stunning}} of farmed Atlantic cod is {{a method}} used to render the fish unconscious before further processing. However, evaluations of the <b>stunning</b> <b>method</b> at plants {{have shown that the}} electrical parameters need to be optimized to achieve instant stunning and prolonged duration of unconsciousness. One aim {{of the present study was}} to establish suitable stunning conditions for cod to comply with future fish welfare regulations. AQUI-S™ is an anaesthetic capable of producing rested fish at slaughter. In the current study, we wanted to assess some welfare aspects of using this agent. In addition, the two stunning methods were compared in terms of the magnitude of the stress response, and the resulting effect on product quality. The data show it was possible to stun cod instantly (0. 5 s) at 107 Vrms, 0. 5 + 0. 2 Arms. However, it was necessary to expose the fish for a longer period (e. g. 15 s) to the same voltage to prolong the period of unconsciousness to facilitate killing without recovery. AQUI-S™ (68 mg L- 1) rendered the fish unconscious without recovery. No noticeable avoidance behaviour or distress was observed during stunning. Blood pH, lactate levels, and blood drainage, as determined after recovery, were similar for both stunning methods. The ability of the white muscle to twitch was not affected by treatment although electrical stunning caused a drop in initial white muscle pH. Hence, a tendency for a more rapid onset of rigor mortis was observed. No detrimental effects on product quality (Quality Index scores, tendency for gaping, ultimate pH, and fillet texture) were observed for either <b>stunning</b> <b>method.</b> Moreover, no blood spots and discolourations of fillets, or spinal fractures were observed. To comply with both good fish welfare protocols, and at the same time ensuring good product quality, we have fundamentally shown that this is indeed possible when cod are stunned with either of the methods described here...|$|E

40|$|Stunning {{efficiency}} {{of male and}} female broiler chickens was analysed in response to the two-phase Simmons step-up stunner. In Phase I, a pulsed DC of 550 Hz is applied in a shallow waterbath. This is immediately followed by Phase II, consisting of a metal plate with sine wave AC of 50 Hz. 120 male and female broiler chickens were randomly allocated to six stunning groups with 10 males and 10 females per group. In Phase I a voltage of 12 or 15 V was applied followed by 40, 50 or 60 V in Phase II. Stunning time was 10 and 5 s in Phase I and II respectively. The rms current per bird was recorded. To assess stunning efficiency the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for 120 s post-stun. Simultaneously the occurrence of spontaneous eye lid blinking, breathing and wing flapping was assessed. The corneal reflex was tested every 20 s. The reduction of brain power in two frequency bands (2 - 30 Hz and 13 - 30 Hz) to less than 10 % of the pre-stun level was analysed as indicator for adequate stunning. Female broilers showed a significantly lower rms stunning current as a result of higher electrical resistance. Phase II showed the biggest impact on stunning efficiency. Increasing voltage improved the stunning effect, but none of the analysed treatments induced unconsciousness in at least 90 % of the animals. Voltage settings of more than 60 V AC in Phase II must therefore be applied. The majority of animals recovered from stunning in all groups. The occurrence of physical reflexes was suppressed in animals that were considered sensitive in the EEG analysis. Assessment of these reflexes for the evaluation of stunning efficiency can therefore not be recommended for this <b>stunning</b> <b>method.</b> No animal showed tonic-clonic convulsions following stunning and the level of severe wing flapping was very low in all groups. Meat quality advantages of this <b>stunning</b> <b>method</b> can therefore be expected, but this must be assessed in a separate study.

40|$|The {{practice}} of electrically stunning poultry, which is standard in North American slaughterhouses (Boyd 1994), results in both welfare and carcass-quality problems.

On the other hand, the controlled-atmosphere killing of poultry—using a mixture of inert gases in air with no more than 2 percent residual oxygen by volume, preferably 80 percent nitrogen and 20 percent argon—helps to significantly alleviate many of these animal-welfare and carcass-quality issues and actually leads to increased revenue.

Before being stunned, the broilers were restrained either by shackling them by the feet, restraining their heads while they were standing, or placing them in a cone. Convulsions during and after stunning were subjectively scored. At 1 d post-mortem, the pH, color, and the intensity and number of hemorrhages, of breast and thigh muscles were measured.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two <b>stunning</b> <b>methods</b> on welfare and meat quality of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and to {{investigate}} the slaughter instrument influence {{on the length of}} cord section technique. The time for loss of spontaneous behaviors, reflexes, as well as the response to pain of 30 fish submitted to spinal cord section (SM) and termonarcosis (TN) were evaluated. Meat rigor-mortis and pH were also measured. Knifes with bilateral (LB) and unilateral (LU) cutting-edge were analyzed in 10 fish per treatment. Unconsciousness was observed after medians of 82 and 750 seconds for SM and TN, respectively (p 0. 05). The medians for SM application were of 21. 5 and 35. 0 seconds for LB and LU, respectively (p 0, 05). As medianas para aplicação da SM foram de 21, 5 e 35, 0 segundos para LB e LU, respectivamente (p< 0, 01). Conclui-se que a SM é uma alternativa superior à TN no que se refere ao tempo para atingir a insensibilização. A ferramenta interfere na duração da SM, sendo necessário o refinamento da técnica para promover a inconsciência imediata dos peixes...|$|R
