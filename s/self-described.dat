40|$|The Self Describing Data Sets (SDDS) file {{protocol}} is {{the basis}} for a powerful and expanding toolkit of generic programs. These programs are used for simulation postprocessing, graphics, data preparation, program interfacing, and experimental data analysis. This document describes Version 1. 30 of the SDDS commandline toolkit. Those wishing to write programs using SDDS should consult the Application Programmer’s Guide for SDDS Version 1. 5 [1]. The first section of the present document is shared with this reference. This document does not describe SDDS-compliant EPICS applications, of which they are many. Some of these will be covered in a separate manual. 1 Why Use <b>Self-Describing</b> Files? Before answering the question posed by the title of this section, it is necessary to define what a <b>self-describing</b> file is. As used here, data in <b>self-describing</b> files has the following attributes: • The data is accessed by name and by class. For example, one might ask for “the column of data called X”, or “the array of data called Y”. <b>Self-describing</b> data is not accessed by position in a file; e. g., one would not ask for “the third column of data”. • Various attributes of the data that may be necessary to using it are available. For example...|$|R
