5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} eight, {{she is the}} Faerie Queen and Oberon's wife. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} woman riding a donkey.|$|E
25|$|Faustine: One {{could say}} she is the most {{ambiguous}} character in the novel or that the fugitive misjudged her the most. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Gypsy, speaks French like a South American and likes to talk about Canada. She is inspired by silent film star Louise Brooks.|$|E
60|$|Maud {{faced her}} defiantly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> princess in captivity facing her gaolers.|$|R
60|$|She snorted emotionally. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aunt who {{has just}} bitten into a bad oyster.|$|R

25|$|When Gaston returns, he is {{surprised}} and discomfited when Gigi appears in her new, adult dress. Gaston stammers out that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giraffe {{and that he}} misses her old outfits. He storms out, realises his folly, and rushes back to apologize. He tells her that she looks lovely, and says that he will prove it to her by taking her to tea at the Reservoir. Gigi's grandmother refuses and tells Gaston that this may ruin her reputation to be seen unchaperoned with Gaston before her reputation has even begun. Gaston, angered, storms out once again.|$|E
500|$|Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "a breathless new biography" [...] by Herbert. In a review in the Herald Sun, Blanche Clark was critical and said, [...] "Herbert's loose timeline is irritating, as is some of her glib commentary, such as: 'When her parents took her out to restaurants, she would use the breadsticks as drum batons—music was clearly in the blood.'" [...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I can tell you lots of the photos are fun, although a few are a little scary, {{like the one in}} which <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match. They made quite a {{contrast}} as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as [...] "so small and doll-like <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown." [...] Crane's main discipline was straight pool, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 [...] On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50–43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. [...] "Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ribbon {{wanted to}} get Chance's {{attention}}, but she moved on to get Real's attention after Chance thought that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{had faded}} out of Noel's face, and, {{with her head}} thrown back and her eyelids half-closed, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scornful young ghost.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be {{considered}} [...] "hot". Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) leads the group voting she is not hot, claiming <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "monster". Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only for Kevin to switch back, saying the debate is whether she is hot, not whether he would have sex with her. Angela (Angela Kinsey) resists the debate, but eventually votes [...] "hot" [...] after getting offended by Kevin's crude remarks. Kelly (Mindy Kaling), who believes herself less attractive than Swank, gets emotional when Toby (Paul Lieberstein) defends his [...] "not hot" [...] vote. Pam (Jenna Fischer) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot, or decide anything at all. Oscar (Oscar Nuñez) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank's facial features, concluding she is [...] "attractive...not hot." [...] An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley (Leslie David Baker) votes hot, claiming pointing out flaws is no way to live life. At the end of the debate, the sides are still tied until Michael, oblivious of their debate, passes by the pictures on the wall and casually calls her hot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commercial}} {{opens with}} a dystopic, industrial setting in blue and grayish tones, showing a line of people (of ambiguous gender) marching in unison through a long tunnel monitored by a string of telescreens. This is {{in sharp contrast to}} the full-color shots of the nameless runner (Anya Major). <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> competitive track and field athlete, wearing an athletic [...] "uniform" [...] (red athletic shorts, running shoes, a white tank top with a cubist picture of Apple’s Macintosh computer, a white sweat band on her left wrist, and a red one on her right), and is carrying a large brass-headed hammer. Rows of marching minions evoke the opening scenes of Metropolis.|$|E

Often {{referred to as a}} [...] "she", Jupiter places her android-like Blondie [...] "children" [...] at the pinnacle of society, whom she only allows only speak to her, mainly Iason. Although Iason is said to be her favorite [...] "son", Jupiter disapproves of Iason's infatuation of Riki and is willing to have his mind wiped if Iason's obsession over Riki worsens. In the 1990s OVAs, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> silver-colored statue in hologram form. In the remake OVAs, she takes the appearance of a large violet hologram with razor-sharped nails, a long, pointed nose, silted eyes with light violet irises with one on her forehead, a broad grin, and mechanic designs on her arms.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{hospitals}} such as Hospital Juárez claim {{she appears}} {{there in her}} old 1930s/60s nurse uniform, which is perfectly ironed (hence the name [...] "La Planchada") and heals patients in the emergency sections. Just as there are claims about how she {{was turned into a}} ghost, there are many others in which eyewitnesses claim she appears. Some say she emits a sort of glow. Others say <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal nurse. Others say she floats, while others say she walks normally, but her steps are never heard. This happens at night and the next morning patients feel better and are taken to another room for further recovery. When asked why they feel better, patients say that [...] "a nurse came in and healed me", but no one in the hospital was either guarding the room or no nurse came at the time the incident happened.|$|E
