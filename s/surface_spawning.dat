40|$|National Monument. Mount St. Helens is {{an active}} dacitic volcano, which is {{currently}} in a semi-dormant state after a cata-strophic explosive eruption in May 1980. A dacite dome occupies the crater and plugs the volcanic vent. The crater area has been progressively covered by a layer of snow, firn, and glacier ice since as early as 1986. Heat, steam, and volcanic gases from the crater fumaroles melted over 2415 meters of cave pas-sage in the crater ice mass. The caves are in approximate balance with the present geothermal heat release. Future changes in the thermal activity will influence the dimensions, location, ceiling, wall, and wall ablation features of these caves. Cave passages are located above fumaroles and fractures in and adjacent to the crater lava dome. Cave passages gradually enlarge by ablation, caused by outside air circulation and by geothermal sources beneath the ice. The passages form a circumferential pattern around the dome, with entrance passages on the dome flanks. Passages grow laterally and vertically toward the <b>surface,</b> <b>spawning</b> ceiling collapse. The crater ice body has been expanding since 1986 and its mean density increases each year. It pos-sesses at least two active crevasses. Trends and changes in geothermal activity in the crater of Mount St. Helens have been noticeable through cave passage observation and re-mapping...|$|E

On {{the premise that}} there are little year-to-year differences, the composite data were arranged to the date of samplings of each year to yield seasonal developmental patterns of each copepod. Seasonal developmental pattern estimated by tracing the {{sequence of}} mean copepodid stages of the population at each sampling date revealed that the recruitment season {{of the population was}} January for N. cristatus, March for N. flemingeri and May for N. plumchrus and E. bungii. In contrast to these copepods with single recruitment seasons in the year, M. pacifica exhibited two recruitment seasons (mid-May and August) in a year. Phenology in reproduction and development of these copepods reflects their species-specific differences in energy utilization pattern; M. pacifica and E. bungii spawn in phytoplankton-rich surface layer in spring (females need to feed for spawning) while Neocalanus spp. spawn in deep layer in winter (females do not feed). Development from C 1 to C 5 of N. cristatus, N. flemingeri and N. plumchrus was in January to June, March to June and May to August, respectively, thus the three sympatric Neocalanus spp. showed a clear temporal separation in the developmental timing in the western subarctic Pacific. This temporal separation in utilizing the surface layer {{is considered to be a}} mechanism to reduce inter-specific food competition.

Postspawning, oocytes of the curimatãs Prochilodus affinis, Prochilodus marggravii and dourado Salminus brasiliensis were surrounded by a thick, three-layered zona pellucida with radial striae. The <b>surface</b> of <b>spawned</b> oocytes of the surubim, Pseudoplatystoma coruscans, was comprised of mucous coat located externally to a thin, two-layered and striated zona pellucida. Oocyte activation during fertilization, lead to cortical reaction, formation of a perivitelline space, reduction of the thickness of the zona pellucida and increase in the oocyte diameter in the four species. Following fertilization, many spermatozoa were embedded in the mucous coat of the surubim oocytes. During embryogenesis, this later coating became thicker, diffuse and less viscous while the zona pellucida (chorion) was thinner in all studied species. Cytochemical analyses indicated species-specific differences in the oocyte <b>surface</b> after <b>spawning.</b> It was suggested that the mucous coat of surubim oocytes play a functional role during fertilization.

While both types have value on their own, we believe much more potent interactions are achievable by unifying interaction techniques across this space. That is, the underlying system should treat this space as a continuum, where a person can naturally move from gestures over the surface to touches directly on it and back again.

40|$|Abstract. The rising {{popularity}} of digital table <b>surfaces</b> has <b>spawned</b> considerable interest in new interaction techniques. Most interactions fall {{into one of}} two modalities: 1) direct touch and multi-touch (by hand and by tangibles) directly on the surface, and 2) hand gestures above the surface. The limitation is that these two modalities ignore the rich interaction space between them. To move beyond this limitation, we first contribute a unification of these discrete interaction modalities called the continuous interaction space. The idea is that many interaction techniques can be developed that go beyond these two modalities, where they can leverage the space between them. That is, we believe that the underlying system should treat the space on and above the surface as a continuum, where a person can use touch, gestures, and tangibles anywhere in the space and naturally move between them. Our second contribution illustrates this, where we introduce a variety of interaction categories that exploit the space between these modalities. For example, wit...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{parental care}} in fish is {{paternal}} care, where the male primarily gives {{care to the}} eggs, and redlip blennies are not exception. [...] A male redlip blenny exhibits typical paternal care behaviors, such as protecting the eggs from predators and blowing fresh air to the eggs. The male also performs a non-typical paternal care: rubbing its anal-urogenital region over the nest's internal <b>surface</b> during <b>spawning.</b> The male redlip blenny has an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. This organ only exists in males due to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, by rubbing the anal-urogenital region over the nest's internal surface, the male protects its eggs from microbial infections, {{one of the most}} common causes for mortality in young fish. Larger males have larger organs at their anal-urogenital regions and thus can provide better antimicrobial protection for the eggs than smaller males. Consequently, female redlip blennies choose their mates based on their size.|$|R
50|$|Flag acaras will pair up at a {{very young}} age, as small as one and a half inches. The fish will flare at each other when pairing up and will later swim {{together}} and breed. They usually stay with their mate {{for the rest of their}} lives. It does not take much to trigger the breeding of these fish. Simple good treatment is more than often enough, although warm and clean water and lots of live food will help. They will almost always lay their eggs on a flat <b>surface,</b> but may <b>spawn</b> directly on gravel.|$|R

After five to seven days of being wigglers, the fish have almost completely consumed their yolk sacs and become free swimming. They are very small, but can normally eat newborn brine shrimp as a first food. They can also be fed liquid fry food, which is available at most fish or pet stores.|$|R
50|$|Adequate {{stream flow}} is {{important}} to Steelhead, for both returning fish as well as young fish migrating to the sea. Lowered stream flows can impede passage for fish in both directions, as fish are unable to breach sand bars that form at the mouths of rivers and streams during the summer months. Natural flows flush fine sediment and silt and provide for better <b>spawning</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the Southern California Steelhead. Higher flows also bring water to riparian areas, which rejuvenate vegetation that provides shade and habitat for spawning fish. This riparian habitat will also better regulate water temperatures.

A related species, sand or marbled goby, {{is the highest}} priced freshwater fish in Asia, and a market for a similar fish exists in expatriate Chinese communities. Sleepy cod breed when minimum temperatures reach 24 °C for more than 3 days. During the breeding season the genital papilla is broad and flattened in females compared to the triangular papilla of males and juveniles. Spawning pairs were usually of approximately equal size. Females could spawn up to 10 times during one breeding season. Wet weather increased the frequency of spawning. Eggs were usually laid hanging from the underside of a <b>surface.</b> Most <b>spawning</b> occurred between 05 : 00 and 10 : 00 h. Females attended egg masses immediately after spawning, after which males cared for eggs until hatching, 3 – 5 days later. Agitation of the egg mass was essential for development. The mean number of eggs per spawning was 43 130. Larvae commenced feeding 2 – 5 days after hatching, on plankton from 100 to 250 m in size. A spawning trap used to collect egg masses is described.

Fifteen isolates shortened the times required from watering to 2 nd and 3 rd flushing and increased yield of the basidiocarps by 1. 1 - 34. 3 % over 30 days.

40|$|Planets with sizes {{between those}} of Earth and Neptune divide into two populations: purely rocky bodies whose atmospheres {{contribute}} negligibly to their sizes, and larger gas-enveloped planets possessing voluminous and optically thick atmospheres. We show that whether a planet forms rocky or gas-enveloped {{depends on the}} solid surface density of its parent disk. Assembly times for rocky cores are sensitive to disk solid surface density. Lower <b>surface</b> densities <b>spawn</b> smaller planetary embryos; to assemble a core of given mass, smaller embryos require more mergers between bodies farther apart and therefore exponentially longer formation times. Gas accretion simulations yield {{a rule of thumb}} that a rocky core must be at least 2 M_⊕ before it can acquire a volumetrically significant atmosphere from its parent nebula. In disks of low solid surface density, cores of such mass appear only after the gas disk has dissipated, and so remain purely rocky. Higher surface density disks breed massive cores more quickly, within the gas disk lifetime, and so produce gas-enveloped planets. We test model predictions against observations, using planet radius as an observational proxy for gas-to-rock content and host star metallicity as a proxy for disk solid surface density.

40|$|Past work on {{fertilization}} in echinoids {{and other}} egg-broadcasting, free-spawning invertebrates {{suggests that these}} organisms might be extremely sperm limited in the field unless individuals spawn in close proximity and under nearly ideal flow conditions. However, virtually all previous experiments have used one or more techniques (surrogates for males and females, and short sampling duration) that bypassed two potentially important aspects of echinoid reproductive biology: the release of gametes in viscous fluids that cling to tests and spines, and extended longevity of eggs and undiluted sperm. We hypothesized that these attributes might interact with some flow regimes to facilitate time-integrated fertilization. Consequently, we explored fertilization processes in sea urchins induced to spawn in a benthic boundary layer in a flow-through flume, with a male 0. 5 m upstream of a female. Our observations and data suggest that at free–stream flow velocities of 2. 5 and 8. 5 cm s� 1, gametes were slowly and continually advected from the aboral <b>surfaces</b> of <b>spawning</b> animals. Eggs {{on the surface of}} the aboral mass were often fertilized before they ablated from the surface; many advected eggs were fertilized after being trapped in the vortex downstream of the female.

These results suggest that fertilization in echinoderms and other free-spawners with viscous, long-lived gamete...|$|R

Most interactions fall {{into one of}} two modalities: 1) direct touch and multi-touch (by hand and by tangibles) directly on the surface, and 2) hand gestures above the surface. The limitation is that these two modalities ignore the rich interaction space between them. To move beyond this limitation, we first contribute a unification of these discrete interaction modalities called the continuous interaction space. The idea is that many interaction techniques can be developed that go beyond these two modalities, where they can leverage the space between them. That is, we believe that the underlying system should treat the space on and above the surface as a continuum, where a person can use touch, gestures, and tangibles anywhere in the space and naturally move between them. Our second contribution illustrates this, where we introduce a variety of interaction categories that exploit the space between these modalities. For example, with our Extended Continuous Gestures category, a person can start an interaction with a direct touch and drag, then naturally lift off the surface and continue their drag with a hand gesture over the surface. For each interaction category, we implement an example (or use prior work) that illustrates how that technique can be applied. In summary, our primary contribution is to broaden the design space of interaction techniques for digital surfaces, where we populate the continuous interaction space both with concepts and examples that emerge from considering this space as a continuum...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of light intensity just prior to and during spawning of Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) merguiensis de Man in the laboratory. Neither the presence of light nor light intensity (0, 10 and 1100 lux) {{had a significant effect}} on the spawning process or hatching rate in P. merguiensis. Difference in the percentage of spawners, percentage of incomplete spawning, fecundity and hatching rate were all insignificant (P > 0. 05) among the three light treatments. However, spawning was delayed (up to 21 min on average) under 1100 lux with a high percentage of incomplete spawning, compared with the Control (0 lux). For the first time, spawning behaviour of P. merguiensis was observed and fully described. The spawning process can be divided into four phases: dormant, pre-spawning, spawning and post-spawning by distinct behaviour of prawn broodstock. The dormant phase was characterized by a quiescent and non-feeding period, whereas movement of prawn broodstock was active during the pre-spawning and post-spawning phases. Depending on the individual, spawning was completed within 3 - 5 min. Prawns often stayed still on the water <b>surface</b> during <b>spawning</b> with occasional manoeuvres to change the position. After a short rest at the termination of the spawning phase, prawn broodstock re-exhibited active movement as in the pre-spawning phase, but showing conspicuous care to the deposited eggs. The role of light in controlling ovarian development and spawning, and the behaviour of prawn broodstock in relation to maximizing fertilization rate are discussed. No Full Tex...|$|R
