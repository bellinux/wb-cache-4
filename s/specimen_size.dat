500|$|The American {{alligator}} is {{a relatively}} large species of crocodilian. On average {{it is the second}} largest species in the Alligatoridae family, behind only the black caiman. As with all crocodilians, and as opposed to many mammals where size eventually diminishes with old age, healthy American alligators may continue to expand throughout their lives and the oldest specimens are the largest. Very old, large male American alligators reach an expected maximum size of up to [...] in length, weighing up to , while females reach a maximum of [...] On rare occasions, a large, old male may grow to an even greater length. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching [...] have been reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at [...] in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the American alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate. If the size of this animal were correct, it would have weighed approximately [...] Large adult American alligators tend to be relatively robust and bulky compared to other similarly length crocodilians, for example captive males measuring [...] were found to weigh [...] (although captive specimens may outweigh wild specimens due to lack of hunting behavior and other stressors).

40|$|Cor-Tuf, broadly {{characterize}} as a reactive powder concrete {{is a type}} of cementitious material. Cementitious {{materials have}} been observed to exhibit a strain-rate dependent mechanical behavior. The mechanical behavior of cementitious materials can also depend significantly on <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes.</b> Therefore it is crucial to determine the behavior of Cor-Tuf with different <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> for high-rate applications. For this purpose, split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), also known as Kolsky bar was utilized to determine the dynamic behavior of Cor-Tuf for different <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> under uniaxial dynamic compression loading at different strain rates. It was observed that as strain rate increases the compressive strength decreases for the small specimen. However for specimens at larger diameter, the compressive strength was observed to be rate independent. The Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus decreases as strain rate increases for all <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes.</b> However the critical strain and energy absorption per unit volume was observed to increase as the strain rate increases. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} program was initiated {{to study and}} isolate the factors responsible for scale effects in the tensile strength of graphite/epoxy composite laminates. Four layups were chosen with appropriate stacking sequences so as to highlight individual and interacting failure modes. Four scale sizes were selected for investigation including full scale size, 3 / 4, 2 / 4, and 1 / 4, with n = to 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The full scale <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> was 32 piles thick as compared to 24, 16, and 8 piles for the 3 / 4, 2 / 4, and 1 / 4 <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> respectively. Results were obtained {{in the form of}} tensile strength, stress-strain curves and damage development. Problems associated with strength degradation with increasing <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> are isolated and discussed. Inconsistencies associated with strain measurements were also identified. Enchanced X-ray radiography was employed for damage evaluation, following step loading. It was shown that fiber dominated layups were less sensitive to scaling effects compared to the matrix dominated layups...|$|R

40|$|Fracture {{properties}} of five different steel fibre-reinforced concretes have been determined, using the wedge splitting test method (WST) and three-point bending tests (3 PBT). Furthermore, for the WST method, two different <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes</b> have been investigated.

The major factor contributing to the differences in the determined stress-crack opening relationships is believed {{to be related to the}} variation in the number of fibres across the fracture plane. However, taking this into consideration, the inverse analyses indicate no systematic differences in the determined parameters between two WST <b>specimen</b> <b>sizes,</b> while the 3 PBT seems to give slightly higher post-cracking stresses...|$|R

40|$|The effect {{loading rate}} on {{fracture}} toughness of ice {{has been investigated}} using sharply edge-notched specimens by bending at - 10 ℃. The loading rate K_ 1 ranged from 1 to about 10 ^ 3 k Pam^ /s. The notch was made by molding a razor blade in the specimen in the ice growing process and removing it before the bending test. Two sizes of specimens,section size 25 × 25 mm (small <b>size</b> <b>specimen)</b> and 50 × 50 mm (medium <b>size</b> <b>specimen)</b> respectively,were used. About thirty small <b>size</b> <b>specimens</b> or about ten medium <b>size</b> <b>specimens</b> were tested at each loading rate. The experimental results were as follows. (1) The values of K_ were lower in the higher K_I range, {{and there was a}} transition in the range of K_I= 10 - 100 kPam^ /s. (2) The effect of K_I was found to be very small in the range of K_I larger than 100 kPam^ /s.
