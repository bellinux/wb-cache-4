40|$|European citizenship, {{identity}} and immigration are constitutive {{issues facing the}} European polity and have important consequences for domestic political systems. There {{has been a great}} deal published about citizenship within the setting of the nation-state and comparative immigration policies, but relatively little has been written on their theorisation in a post-national, post-statist context, such as the EU, and on alternative European institutional designs. Now available in paperback, this volume blends normative political theory with European integration, and develops an original theoretical framework for European Union citizenship, {{identity and}} immigration as well as a set of policy proposals for institutional reform. Challenging the conventionally held views in these areas, the author argues that a constructive model of European citizenship and identity is vital to the construction of a democratic, heterogeneous and inclusive European polity.

40|$|Never before {{have so many}} {{moved so}} {{frequently}} as now. Mobility lies at the centre for the concern ofstates, business and technological development. Some even claim that we are witnessing a mobility turn inthe social sciences. However, as the capacity to move has increased so too has the control and surveillanceof mobility become more extensive. Since September 11, 2001 security has been the defining paradigm fora variety for actors. The mobility security regime implies among other things that passengers are in somesense always suspect. The securitization of mobility, however, is not a post 9 / 11 phenomenon. TheSchengen Convention has lead to a dismantling of the inner borders of the member states of theEuropean Union. The Constitution of the European Union guarantees the four freedoms of circulation –of goods, services, people and capital. At the same time <b>Schengenland</b> implies also that the mobility ofnon-Europeans is highly monitored and controlled. The paradox of “free” mobility and heightened control of movement is the major theme of this senioressay. Airports have emerged as a key channel and space for securing and sorting out mobilities. Thus, thesecuritization of mobility has made airports key spaces that enact differential mobility rights. How doesthe securitization of airports affect the mobility rights of individuals and what consequences do thebiometric and digital controls have for individual travellers? These are the questions that are examined inthis essay. Theories of mobility, security and images of threat provide the analytical context of this study. The empirical material draws on interviews made with individuals that have experienced “ethnic profiling”and have {{been the target of}} extra security checks. In order to provide a more nuanced picture of oursubject, we have also interviewed passengers who experienced “positive discrimination”. The material athand also includes on interviews with security staff as well as security training personnel. One of our conclusions is that people of foreign origin or with a non-Scandinavian look are morelikely to be the object of additional security checks. All of the informants substantiate that security checksat airports are not random and are convinced that the reason for the additional security check is fear ofcertain kind of people. Predictably, those responsible for the security maintain {{that this is not the}} case andclaim that the possibility of making subjective judgements and control people even if the metal detectordoes not give off an alarm signal, is a part of the security routine. Passengers are thus unaware of whetherthe extra controls are based on spot-checks or the subjective assessments of security staff. The subjectiveelement combined with media images and threat discourses increase the likelihood for “ethnic profiling”of passengers.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} this dissertation is to conceptualise the spatiality of citizenship through an exposure to its various others – especially to mobile subjectivity. In particular, it examines the changing patterns of territorialising space, distributing rights and regulating mobility in the intertwined politics of citizenship and that of migration in the EU. Building on the approach of critical citizenship studies, it assumes that the practices and discourses of othering have been constituent of the very foundation of modern citizenship, and understands citizenship at the interface between the governing structure and the acts of the governed that rupture, resist or appropriate it. In this framework, the thesis first of all looks at the spatial configurations of national citizenship by analysing the trajectories in which the interrelated concepts of territory, rights and mobility participate, and are reshaped, in the project of making the citizen and her various others. The {{main part of the}} thesis investigates {{the ways in which the}} interrelations between these spatial dimensions of citizenship are reconfigured in a multiplied citizenship-migration nexus under the process of Europeanisation. It first looks at two different notions of territory – a statist one and a networked one – that are visible in the official discourses, yet it highlights the fact that the technologies that are supposed to produce each type of territoriality often converge. Thus I read the politics of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel project as one that involves competing patterns of territoriality and manifests the dynamics between facilitated and obstructed mobilities at a moving border. However, the permeability of this border is partly enabled by the uneven and ambiguous configurations of <b>Schengenland</b> itself, and draws attention to the excessive forms of mobility that challenge and break with the official formulation of free movement rights. Thus we turn to the intricate relationship between mobility and citizenship in Europe following our dialogical approach: focusing on the rationalities implied in the government of free movement on one hand, and the paths through which to redefine the right to mobility on the other. In the light of Rancière’s reconceptualisation of rights and democracy, I present two examples each employing different strategies to politicise and mobilise mobility: one is through appealing to the universal, the other legitimating the particular. The politics of mobility is also seen as an endeavour of producing alternative spaces against the territorialised state-centric space to which the imagination of citizenship is usually limited. In discussing a possible global ethics, however, I argue that the dynamics between rights and citizenship are not bound to an emancipatory end. While the juridical system of differentiated rights is constantly challenged by those who claim that they have the rights they are denied to, once the ‘achievements’ of rights-claims are re-appropriated in the juridico-political form of citizenship, this form continues to reproduce boundaries and differential inclusions which shall again be contested. A self-critical global ethics therefore should be conscious about the imperfectability of citizenship and the impossibility of community.
