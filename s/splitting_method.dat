40|$|<b>Splitting</b> <b>methods</b> {{constitute}} a class (numerical) schemes for solving initial value problems. Roughly speaking, they decompose the vector field into several parts and integrate these parts separately. <b>Splitting</b> <b>methods</b> are frequently {{used for the}} time discretisation of partial differential equations. The {{reason for this is}} that the splitting procedure yields highly competitive time stepping schemes which can dramatically reduce the required computational effort, compared to schemes based on the full vector field. Recent surveys on <b>splitting</b> <b>methods</b> are given in the monographs [1, 6] and in the article [8]. The first part of the mini-course will be devoted to <b>splitting</b> <b>methods</b> for ODEs. Following [1], we shall derive the (non-stiff) order conditions via the well-known Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. In the second part, emphasis will be laid on a sound convergence theory for <b>splitting</b> <b>methods</b> applied to time dependent partial differential equations. In particular, we will cover the following topics: evolution equations with unbounded operators; <b>splitting</b> <b>methods</b> for Schrödinger equations; dimension splitting for parabolic problems; boundary conditions; high-order <b>splitting</b> <b>methods</b> for analytic semigroups; nonlinear problems.

5000|$|Circa 1803, {{according}} to William Pattee's History of Old Braintree and Quincy (1878) Josiah Bemis, George Stearns, and Michael Wild developed a <b>splitting</b> <b>method</b> similar in concept to the plug and feather method. This technique for splitting stone (referred to by modern researchers as the [...] "Flat Wedge Method") entailed cutting slots {{in a shallow}} line into the stone using a cape chisel struck with a large hammer. Small, flat metal wedges were then driven between shims made of sheet iron. The method of feathers and plugs began to be employed around this time, and spread rapidly throughout the region. Evidence of stone split with both methods indicate the evolution of this technique. The method using the cape chisel created long rectangular slots, whereas the newer method, using a plug drill, left round holes.|$|E
5000|$|AUSM {{stands for}} Advection Upstream <b>Splitting</b> <b>Method.</b> It is {{developed}} as a numerical inviscid flux function for solving a general system of conservation equations. It {{is based on the}} upwind concept and was motivated to provide an alternative approach to other upwind methods, such as the Godunov method, flux difference splitting methods by Roe, and Solomon and Osher, flux vector splitting methods by Van Leer, and Steger and Warming. The AUSM first recognizes that the inviscid flux consist of two physically distinct parts, i.e., convective and pressure fluxes. The former is associated with the flow (advection) speed, while the latter with the acoustic speed; or respectively classified as the linear and nonlinear fields. Currently, the convective and pressure fluxes are formulated using the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian matrices. The method was originally proposed by Liou and Steffen [...] for the typical compressible aerodynamic flows, and later substantially improved in [...] to yield a more accurate and robust version. To extend its capabilities, it has been further developed in [...] for all speed-regimes and multiphase flow. Its variants have also been proposed.|$|E
