The desired collision triangle that considers both gravity and the vehicle’s axial acceleration is analytically derived based on geometric conditions. The concept of instantaneous zero-effort-miss is introduced {{to allow for}} analytical guidance command derivation. By formulating a finite time instantaneous zero-effort-miss regulation problem, the proposed optimal guidance law is derived through <b>Schwarz’s</b> <b>inequality</b> approach. The relationships of the proposed formulation with conventional proportional navigation guidance and guidance-to-collision are analyzed, and {{the results show that}} the proposed guidance law encompasses previously suggested approaches. The significant contribution of the proposed guidance law lies in that it ensures zero final guidance command and enables energy saving with the aid of using gravity turn. Nonlinear numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|A {{tomography}} {{method is}} proposed to image magnetic anomaly sources buried below a non-flat ground surface, by developing {{the expression of}} the total power associated with a measured magnetic field. By discretising the integral relating a static magnetic field to its source terms, the total power can be written as a sum of crosscorrelation products between the magnetic field data set and the theoretical expression of the magnetic field generated by a source element of unitary strength. Then, applying <b>Schwarz's</b> <b>inequality,</b> an occurrence probability function is derived for imaging any distribution of magnetic anomaly sources in the subsurface. The tomographic procedure consists in scanning the half-space below the survey area by the unitary source and in computing the occurrence probability function at the nodes of a regular grid within the half-space. The grid values are finally contoured in order to single out the zones with high probability of occurrence of buried magnetic anomaly sources. Synthetic and field examples are discussed to test the resolution power of the proposed tomography. Comment: 15 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the stability analysis of current-carrying plasmas, i. e., plasma systems that are forced by external mchanisms to carry a nonrelaxing electrical current. Under restriction to translationally invariant configurations, the thermodynamic stability criterion for a multicomponent plasma is rederived within the framework of nonideal MHD. The chosen dynamics neglects scalar resistivity, but allows for other types of dissipation effects both in Ohm's law and in the equation of motion. In the second section of the paper, the thermodynamic stability criterion is compared with the ideal MHD based energy principle of Bernstein et al. With the help of <b>Schwarz's</b> <b>inequality,</b> it is shown that the former criterion is always more 'pessimistic' than the latter, i. e., that thermodynamic stability implies stability according to the MHD principle, but not vice versa. This reuslt confirms the physical plausible idea that dissipational effects tend to weaken the stability properties of current-carrying plasma equilibria by breaking the constraints of ideal MHD and allowing for possibly destabilizing effects such as magnetic field line reconfiguration...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} free {{holomorphic}} functions on regular polyballs and provide analogues of several classical results from complex analysis such as: Abel theorem, Hadamard formula, Cauchy <b>inequality,</b> <b>Schwarz</b> lemma, and maximum principle. These results are used {{together with a}} class of noncommutative Berezin transforms to obtain a complete description of the group Aut(B_n) of all free holomorphic automorphisms of the polyball. The abstract polyball B_n has a universal model S consisting of left creation operators acting on tensor products of full Fock spaces. We determine: the group of automorphisms of the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra C*(S) which leaves invariant the noncommutative polyball algebra A_n; the group of unitarily implemented automorphisms of the polyball algebra A_n and the noncommutative Hardy algebra F_n^∞, respectively. We prove that the free holomorphic automorphism group Aut(B_n) is a sigma-compact, locally compact topological group {{with respect to the}} topology induced by an appropriate metric. Finally, we obtain a concrete unitary projective representation of the topological group Aut(B_n) in terms of noncommutative Berezin kernels associated with regular polyballs. Comment: 46 page...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{prove the}} {{convergence}} of some multiplicative and additive <b>Schwarz</b> methods for <b>inequalities</b> which contain contraction operators. The problem is stated in a reflexive Banach space and it generalizes the well-known fixed-point problem in the Hilbert spaces. Error estimation theorems are given for three multiplicative algorithms and two additive algorithms. We show that these algorithms are in fact Schwarz methods if the subspaces {{are associated with a}} decomposition of the domain. Also, for the one- and two-level methods in the finite element spaces, we write the convergence rates as functions of the overlapping and mesh parameters. They are similar with the convergence rates of these methods for linear problems. Besides the direct use of the five algorithms for the inequalities with contraction operators, we can use the above results to obtain the convergence rate of the Schwarz method for other types of inequalities or nonlinear equations. In this way, we prove the convergence and estimate the error of the one- and two-level Schwarz methods for some inequalities in Hilbert spaces which are not of the variational type, and also, for the Navier–Stokes problem. Finally, we give conditions of existence and uniqueness of the solution for all problems we consider. We point out that these conditions and the convergence conditions of the proposed algorithms are of the same type...|$|R
