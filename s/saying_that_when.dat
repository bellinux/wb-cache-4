25|$|Joshua {{secretly}} dispatched two spies from Shittim, instructing them to {{view the}} land and Jericho, {{and they went to}} the house of a harlot named Rahab. That night, the king of Jericho received word that Israelite men had come to search out the land, and the king sent a demand to Rahab to deliver the men who had come to her house. But Rahab hid the men among stalks of flax on her roof, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it was dark the men had left, and she did not know where they went. The king's men left the city in pursuit of the spies {{on the road to the}} Jordan River, and the people of the city shut the city gate after them.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{his initial}} {{confession}}, Riley, {{who was an}} adult over 18 (aged 20) {{at the time of}} the crime, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing Jim and Naomi Olive and faced the death penalty. Under hypnosis, Riley later recanted the part of his initial confession about beating Naomi Olive with the hammer, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he entered the house, he found Naomi Olive lying in bed, bleeding from head wounds and near death, with the hammer embedded in her head. Riley thus implied that Marlene Olive (who had been using the hammer that morning to repair a platform shoe) had fatally beaten her mother with the hammer before leaving the house. Riley contended that he had stabbed and suffocated Naomi Olive because she was suffering and near death from the hammer attack, and he was trying to end her misery. He said that he initially confessed to killing Naomi Olive in order to protect Marlene Olive by taking the blame for her actions. Riley admitted shooting Jim Olive, but said he acted out of fear and self-defense as Jim had threatened to kill him.|$|E
500|$|In his 1191 Itinerarium Cambriae ("Journey through Wales"), [...] Gerald of Wales {{mentioned}} the church, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Normans were ransacking Anglesey during a Welsh revolt led by Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1098, Hugh of Montgomery, {{one of the}} Norman lords, had kept his dogs in Llandyfydog church. [...] He added that the dogs had gone mad by the morning, and the earl had been killed within a week.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Burnside Burn" [...] was {{organized}} by Portland NORML, the {{local chapter of the}} National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in celebration of the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Oregon and to circumnavigate a temporary limit on recreational sales. According to Russ Belville, the chapter's executive director, the event began with the idea of taking a photograph in front of the White Stag sign. He recalled: [...] "It evolved from me <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> legalization happens, I want to take a photo under the Portland, Oregon sign. Other people said, 'Can we give marijuana away?' [...] I said, 'I can't stop you!'" ...|$|E

500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, 2007, West {{suggested}} that his race {{had something to}} do with his being overlooked for opening the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in favor of Britney Spears; he claimed, [...] "Maybe my skin's not right." [...] West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all five awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he made the song [...] "Stronger" [...] that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it. He has also stated that Spears has not had a hit in a long period of time and that MTV exploited her for ratings.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>When</b> We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

500|$|McCartney asked Klein to {{dissolve}} the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took {{the case to the}} High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Malcolm Jack {{was less}} impressed; {{he stated that}} when Lewis tried to diversify the show by dancing or {{switching}} the arrangements, she risked becoming the British diva that pop music forgot. Jack said that during a [...] "sassy dance routine" [...] for [...] "Forgive Me" [...] Lewis came off as a [...] "budget Beyoncé", whilst on the [...] "cringey windin' and grindin' reggae take on 'Better in Time' song" [...] she comes across like a [...] "reasonably priced Rihanna". Jack concluded by saying the show {{was in need of}} a shot of [...] "adrenaline". In writing for the Nottingham Post, Paul Hindle agreed, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the tempo increased and choreography was introduced [...] "Lewis looked endearingly uncomfortable"; however, Hindle was positive about Lewis' vocals, calling her vocal performance [...] "virtuoso". He concluded that Lewis' [...] "spellbinding rendition" [...] of [...] "Run" [...] was a highlight of the concert, and that fans should not have left disappointed.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{also sought}} to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film, The X-Files, explaining, [...] "I think {{if there was any}} trouble with the movie, it was that we promised so much that we didn't deliver all of it. I think we wanted to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E

500|$|Casting {{of the new}} {{characters}} for series 1 {{was announced}} on 25 November 2009. Open auditions were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East, followed by recalls until the possible actors were reduced to eight and then four. Yorke {{described it as a}} [...] "painful process" [...] and they had difficulty finding someone to play Zsa Zsa Carter. Emer Kenny was cast in the role whilst writing the second episode. Yorke said [...] "She was so good that we suddenly went, 'It's her! Kenny said, [...] "I'm really thrilled to have been given the opportunity to both write for and act in a show connected with such an iconic drama as EastEnders. Kids these days use their laptops more than their televisions, so it's really exciting {{to be a part of}} a project that's taking drama online and connecting with these viewers." [...] To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her [...] "posh" [...] accent, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the director asked her what she would do about her voice, she travelled around the East End to listen to the way people spoke.|$|E
500|$|Having {{admired her}} {{performance}} in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page {{in the lead}} role, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he read the screenplay {{for the first time}} he pictured her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he would have been happy to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had [...] "in mind right from the start" [...] were Olivia Thirlbywho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Junoand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: [...] "This is a movie that’s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn’t make sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The crew {{issued a}} casting {{call for the}} main roles in the series, with both Keating and Billingsley making {{immediate}} impressions on the casting director and staff. Braga said that {{they knew they were}} right for those roles [...] "right off the bat". Keating had previously auditioned for a role on Voyager two years prior, but Berman wanted to keep him for a future main role, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he auditioned for Reed that the actor [...] "nailed it", although there were discussions about the accent he should be using with Keating suggesting one from the North of England but the producers mistook it for Scottish. In the end, they chose to go with Keating's natural voice. He also praised the casting processes involving Trinneer, Park and Billingsley, calling the latter [...] "perfect" [...] in his role as Doctor Phlox. Park wasn't required to audition, but instead was hired on the basis of her performance in a scene she appeared in The WB series Popular alongside Anthony Montgomery – despite that the character was intended to be older until Park was cast. Montgomery had previously auditioned to play Tuvok's son in Voyager, and after being chosen for the part of Travis Mayweather, he elected to take the part instead of a role in a low budget movie he had been offered.|$|E

500|$|Wayne MacLaurin of SF Site {{describes}} the module as [...] "a classic" [...] and a [...] "must have" [...] for gamers, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he played the}} game in high school, most of his group's characters quickly died. MacLaurin explains that Tomb of Horrors is a classic not because of its difficulty, {{but because it was}} the first module that did not involve killing large amounts of monsters; it was a [...] "collection of puzzles and maps." [...] Its focus on traps rather than monsters was a surprise to gamers at the time. [...] One technique that some players used to get past the deathtraps was to drive cattle ahead of them, which Lore Sjöberg of Wired described as [...] "a bit less than heroic", noting that in Lord of the Rings Gandalf did not send [...] "50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait." [...] David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, discussed the adventure's reputation as [...] "the deadliest game ever written", noting that it [...] "unloads a series of complicated puzzles and nightmarish traps" [...] on characters, concluding that [...] "Few survive long enough to collect any treasure, and even fewer manage to find their way back through the deadly maze and escape with their spoils." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Wall Street Journal {{magazine}} quoted Sharon Osberg, Buffett's bridge partner, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{she first}} visited his office 20 years earlier, he tricked her into {{playing a game}} with nontransitive dice {{that could not be}} won and [...] "thought it was hilarious".|$|E
2500|$|Father Jacquet also preached, <b>saying</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> visiting Borges {{before his}} death, {{he had found}} [...] "a man full of love, who {{received}} from the Church the forgiveness of his sins".
