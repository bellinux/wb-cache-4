50|$|Gagea pratensis, {{called the}} Yellow <b>Star-of-Bethlehem,</b> is a European and Mediterranean plant {{species in the}} lily family. It is {{widespread}} across much of Europe as well as Turkey and Morocco. It was first described to science by Persoon in 1794.|$|E
5000|$|Ornithogalum thyrsoides is a {{bulbous plant}} species that is endemic to the Cape Province in South Africa. It {{is also known}} by the common names of chinkerinchee or chincherinchee, <b>star-of-Bethlehem</b> or wonder-flower. [...] It {{produces}} long-lasting flowers prized as cut flowers.|$|E
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, the Early <b>Star-of-Bethlehem</b> blooms earlier {{than most other}} species of Gagea, and is usually found in flower from January to March or April. Its flowers {{are very similar to}} those of the Yellow <b>Star-of-Bethlehem.</b> This belongs to the same genus but it is a less {{vigorous}} plant, growing to a height of 2-6 cm and normally having just a single pair of twisting, thread-like basal leaves, with one or two pairs of laneolate leaves, perhaps 1 cm wide, just below the flowers. The flowers, of which there are usually no more than four on each plant, are yellow and have six petals; they are about 1½ cm in diameter. It grows mainly on dry grassland.|$|E
50|$|The genus {{is named}} after the English naturalist Sir Thomas Gage (1791-1820). They were {{originally}} described as species of Ornithogalum, which, together with the usual yellow colour of the flowers, explains the English name yellow <b>star-of-Bethlehem</b> for the common European species, Gagea lutea.|$|E
50|$|Ornithogalum umbellatum, {{the garden}} <b>star-of-Bethlehem,</b> grass lily, nap-at-noon, or eleven-o'clock lady, is a {{perennial}} bulbous flowering plant, native {{throughout most of}} southern and central Europe, north-western Africa and south-western Asia.

There are also areas of grassland which is lightly grazed by rabbits and is a mosaic of close grazed and rough swards, and wetter areas.|$|E
50|$|Ash is {{the most}} {{widespread}} tree in the wood, but {{a large number of}} mature oaks also occur. Present in the wood's ground flora are the nationally scarce Spiked <b>Star-of-Bethlehem</b> (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum), and other species include Herb-paris (Paris quadrifolia), Broad-leaved Helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), Woodruff (Galium odoratum), Wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), Sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and Moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina).|$|E

The wood is also the only known location in Norfolk where the yellow <b>star-of-Bethlehem</b> grows.|$|E
50|$|The Geneva Bible {{posits that}} the dung {{was used as}} a fuel for fire. Jewish {{historian}} Josephus suggested that dove's dung could have been used as a salt substitute. An alternative view is that 'dove's dung' was a popular name for some other food, such as <b>Star-of-Bethlehem</b> or falafel. A third position, based on amending the Hebrew text, is that the passage actually refers to locust-beans, the fruit of the carob tree.|$|E
5000|$|Ornithogalum nutans, {{known as}} {{drooping}} <b>star-of-Bethlehem,</b> is {{a species of}} flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Europe and South West Asia. It is a bulbous perennial growing to 20 - 60 cm tall by 5 cm wide, with strap-shaped leaves and green striped, pendent grey-white flowers in spring. It is cultivated, and has naturalized, outside its native range, for example in North America. [...] It has become extremely invasive along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Maryland. At least in North America, {{it is not as}} common as Ornithogalum umbellatum.|$|E
50|$|Ornithogalum is a genus of {{perennial}} plants mostly native to southern Europe and southern Africa {{belonging to the}} family Asparagaceae. Some species are native to other {{areas such as the}} Caucasus. Growing from a bulb, species have linear basal leaves and a slender stalk, up to 30 cm tall, bearing clusters of typically white star-shaped flowers, often striped with green. The common name of the genus, <b>Star-of-Bethlehem,</b> is based on its star-shaped flowers, after the Star of Bethlehem that appeared in the biblical account of the birth of Jesus. The number of species has varied considerably, depending on authority, from 50 to 300.|$|E
5000|$|Ashridge Wood (...) is a 15.6ha {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest between Beedon and Compton in West Berkshire District, Berkshire, UK (near RG20 8AB). It {{is within}} the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wood is a surviving section of a once larger ancient coppiced woodland, although part was planted with conifers during the 20th century. Notified as an SSSI in 1954, it is particularly notable for its flowering woodland plants, including an abundance of Spiked <b>Star-of-Bethlehem</b> Ornithogalum pyrenaicum. Ash predominates, with Cherry, Oak, Sallow and Whitebeam scattered throughout. Most of the conifers had been removed by 2009.|$|E
50|$|Damaraland mole-rats are herbivorous, feeding {{solely on}} tubers, corms, and bulbs. Favoured foods include such plants as Acanthosicyos, <b>Star-of-Bethlehem,</b> Ledebouria, and Talinum. Their natural predators include mole snakes, and {{occasionally}} other local snakes, such as cobras. They do not drink, obtaining all their water from their food, {{which is also}} an important source of minerals. Unlike most other mammals, they can effectively metabolise these minerals without access to vitamin D, which they lack because they are normally never exposed to sunlight. The basal metabolic rate of Damaraland mole rats is also unusually low for mammals of their size, at just 0.66 cm3 O2 / g · h.|$|E
50|$|Like other mole-rats, Cape mole-rats rarely travel above ground, {{and spend}} most of their lives within {{excavated}} burrow systems. Their burrows typically range from 50 to 130 m in length, with tunnels about 10 cm wide. They are herbivorous, feeding on the bulbs, corms and tubers of plants such as <b>Star-of-Bethlehem,</b> Cape tulips, and wood-sorrels, among others. They obtain this food by digging foraging tunnels to reach plant roots; these tunnels are narrower than their main tunnels and may be as little as 0.5 to 2.5 cm below the surface. Food may also be taken to deeper storage chambers to store up for hard times, or when a female is raising young. They have no need to drink, being able to obtain all the water they need from their diet.|$|E
50|$|Cleaves Wood is an ancient, {{semi-natural}} deciduous woodland on oolitic limestone. It {{has a high}} {{diversity of}} tree and shrub species and a large population of the nationally scarce plant spiked <b>star-of-Bethlehem</b> (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum) also known as Bath asparagus. There are also areas of grassland which is lightly grazed by rabbits and is a mosaic of close grazed and rough swards, and wetter areas. The scarce plants found here include the fly orchid and wild daffodil. The habitat diversity of the site {{has resulted in a}} rich invertebrate fauna, including two nationally rare insects: the beetle Osphya bipunctata and the hoverfly Cheilosia nigripes. Twenty-seven butterflies have been recorded from the including the nationally scarce species, the Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina). The nationally scarce moth, Blomer's rivulet (Discoloxia blomeri) has also been recorded on the site. Other nationally scarce species include the snail Ena montana, the hoverfly Xanthogramma citrofasciatum, and a number of beetle species.|$|E
40|$|<b>Star-of-Bethlehem</b> is an {{herbaceous}} {{plant in the}} lily family (Liliaceae) that grows from bulbs with annual renewal. The bulbs are ovoid in shape and measure 0. 5 - 1. 5 inches in length. The coat of the bulb is membranous. Shiny, dark green leaves are narrow and linear with distinct white midrib. Leaves are approximately 4 - 12 inches long and 0. 1 - 0. 2 inch wide and are hollow in cross section. Flowers consist of 6 white petals, 0. 5 - 0. 75 inches in diameter, which collectively resemble a star. Flowers occur {{at the ends of}} leafless flowering stems (scapes) and can grow up to can grow up to 1 foot in height but are usually shorter. The umbel-like raceme contains 3 - 10 flowers that appear from May to June. The fruit is a 3 -lobed capsule that contains several oval black seed. Emerging <b>star-of-Bethlehem</b> shoots resemble wild garlic or wild onion but lack the characteristic odor of these species. Habitat: This plant prefers moist to wet habitats. It can be found along the banks of rivers and streams, in disturbed situations, in early succession forest, forest edge, floodplain forest, wet meadows, yards and gardens.
