50|$|Two large rolls {{typically}} {{form the}} ends of the drainage section, which is called the drainage table. The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the <b>suction</b> (<b>couch)</b> roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after <b>suction</b> boxes and <b>couch</b> rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the forming fabric and the web in a laboratory suction box during a suction pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web. In some trials the reached dry content did not decrease at all after the suction pulse. Second the idea was verified in pilot scale. The rewetting was unfortunately not reduced in the same extent in the pilot trials as in the laboratory trials. But with the proposed justifications of the method it could be proved to work in also pilot scale. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
