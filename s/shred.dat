5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin.

5|$|The <b>shred</b> {{music of}} the 1980s was a major {{influence}} on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of the vinyl LP.|$|E

5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, <b>shred,</b> and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E

5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later <b>shred</b> several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help <b>shred</b> their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E

5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a fount of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his shape into an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then on through the supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, but he managed to change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been <b>shred</b> down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to the ravages of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E

5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and <b>shred</b> larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

The most recent {{survey conducted by the}} Scrap Tire Management Council reported that 850 million tires are stockpiled in the United States, with an additional 250 million tires still generated each year (1995). The research described herein was undertaken to develop design guidelines for <b>shredded</b> tire stream crossings. The shear strength properties have been investigated for tire <b>shreds</b> as well as tire <b>shreds</b> in contact with glacial till. The <b>shredded</b> tires range from 40 mm to 1. 4 m in length. There are several documented cases where <b>shredded</b> tires have been used successfully as drainage structures. Most of these projects make use of tire chips or <b>shreds</b> ranging from 13 to 152 mm in size. Since production costs for larger-size <b>shreds</b> are significantly less, they offer a distinct advantage over the smaller shreds.;This study uses large scale direct shear tests to investigate the shear strength of large-size tire <b>shreds.</b> Like other studies conducted on tire <b>shreds,</b> Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to interpret laboratory results. This study concludes that for pure tire <b>shreds,</b> no correlation appears to exist between the size of tire <b>shreds</b> and Mohr-Coulomb failure parameters.

Referring to the comparison drawn to shredded books in the introduction: while for mapping assemblies one would have a very similar book as template (perhaps with the names of the main characters and a few locations changed), the de-novo assemblies are more hardcore in a sense as one would not know beforehand whether this would become a science book, a novel, a catalogue, or even several books.

He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. <b>Shredder</b> then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. <b>Shredder</b> then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach <b>Shredder,</b> Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. <b>Shredder</b> forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own.

During the battle, <b>Shredder</b> tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at <b>Shredder.</b> However, before <b>Shredder</b> can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance.
