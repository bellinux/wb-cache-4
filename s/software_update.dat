5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a <b>software</b> <b>update,</b> one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|Life with PlayStation was a Folding@home {{application}} {{available for}} PlayStation 3 which connected to Stanford University’s Folding@home distributed computer network {{and allowed the}} user to donate their console's spare processing cycles to the project. Folding@home is supported by Stanford University and volunteers {{make a contribution to}} society by donating computing power to this project. Research made by the project may eventually contribute to the creation of vital cures. The Folding@home client was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment in collaboration with Stanford University. Life with PlayStation also consisted of a 3D virtual view of the Earth and contained current weather and news information of various cities and countries from around the world, as well as a World Heritage channel which offered information about historical sites, and the United Village channel which is a project designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide. As of PlayStation 3 system <b>software</b> <b>update</b> version 4.30 on October 24, 2012, the Life With PlayStation project has ended.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory <b>software</b> <b>update</b> upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E
