5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and complimented the choreography saying Spears had not danced with so much conviction since the In the Zone era. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse likened the video's choreography and dancer's wardrobe to Janet Jackson's [...] "Feedback" [...] video. Jocelyn Vena of MTV gave the video a positive review, stating that it's a [...] "sexy, fast-paced clip" [...] and that [...] "there are a few moments in the video where Britney's personality shines" [...] adding that [...] "she <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> the song's [...] lyrics, particularly when she finishes the song's bridge." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly complimented the video's choice of wardrobe, but said that the video was [...] "sparse", adding [...] "there's not much to the single besides trite, ridiculous advocation for a ménage à trois anyway, so why would the video go any deeper?". The Daily Mail said the video [...] "features Britney writhing around in scantily-clad outfits with male dancers {{in the best way}} she knows how".|$|E
500|$|As {{the seasons}} progressed, and the {{character}} began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> key moments, or [...] "self-deprecating humor". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode [...] "Justice", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off. To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because {{it is well known}} that Lex always wanted hair. This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's [...] "Lockdown", Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer Steven S. DeKnight describes it, the audience gets to see a moment where Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this [...] "perfect person". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.|$|E
