2500|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} to the standard m/z notation that appear in the literature; however, these are not currently accepted by standards organizations and most journals. [...] m/e appears in older historical literature. A label more consistent with the IUPAC green book and ISO 31 conventions [...] is m/Q or m/q where m is the symbol for mass and Q or q the symbol for charge with the units u/e or Da/e. This notation is not uncommon in the physics of mass spectrometry but is rarely used as the abscissa of a mass spectrum. It was also suggested to introduce a new unit thomson (Th) as a unit of m/z, where 1 Th = 1 u/e. According to this convention, mass spectra x axis could be labeled m/z (Th) and negative ions would have negative values. This notation is rare and not accepted by IUPAC or any other <b>standards</b> <b>organisation.</b>|$|E

40|$|The IT (information technology) {{standardisation}} {{landscape is}} characterised by the increasing importance of private standard setting consortia, a greater convergence between the structural features of formal and private <b>standard</b> <b>organisations,</b> and greater diversity in <b>standard</b> <b>organisations.</b> Institutional {{theory has been}} applied to explain the convergence of standard setting bodies. This paper applies institutional theory to four studies of <b>standards</b> <b>organisations,</b> showing that there are indeed homogenising mimetic, coercive and normative forces in standard setting that lead to the convergence of emergent organisations with the institutional features, but that there are also forces promoting heterogeneity, in particular the multiplicity of institutional fields within which standards consortia operate, leading to a complex, and often conflicting, matrix of institutional norms to be accommodated...|$|R
