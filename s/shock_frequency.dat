5000|$|A.D.O.R. formed his {{own record}} company in 1996: Tru Reign Records. For his fledgling label he {{immediately}} recorded and released {{as a single}} another Pete Rock track, [...] "Enter the Center". It was a successful venture. Stanton reports that it sold [...] "remarkably well" [...] given its independent, small scale distribution, and received heavy radio play. He considers it the equal of its predecessor [...] "Let It All Hang Out", but Juon goes further, offering that both Rock and Castellanos had improved their respective techniques in the six years between the two tracks. He draws attention to a new-found depth in the lyrical content of A.D.O.R.'s rap, putting this advancement down to maturity and experience in the later record. HipHopDX's reviewer found in [...] "Enter the Center" [...] "more of Pete Rock's understated brilliance". A.D.O.R.'s singles to date were collected on his debut album for Tru Reign, <b>Shock</b> <b>Frequency</b> (1998). Rock and Marley Marl were joined there by Diamond D and Clark Kent, making an impressive roster.

The effects of response-dependent and response-independent shock were compared in Experiment III by using a yoked-control procedure in which each pigeon received each type of shock delivery at different times.

40|$|Is a {{conditioned}} aversive stimulus {{necessary in}} avoidance conditioning? Or is {{a reduction in}} the rate of aversive stimulation alone sufficient to generate and maintain an avoidance response? Rats were subjected to an avoidance procedure in which shocks occurred randomly in time, but a response could reduce the overall rate of shock. Fifteen acquisition curves, obtained from 16 animals, showed both immediate and delayed, rapid and gradual increases in response rate; there was no representative acquisition curve. Response rates were directly related to the amount by which the response reduced <b>shock</b> <b>frequency.</b> In extinction, when shock rates were not affected by responding, the response total was inversely related to the amount by which the response had reduced <b>shock</b> <b>frequency</b> during prior conditioning, with as many as 20, 000 extinction responses when the <b>shock</b> <b>frequency</b> reduction had been relatively small. Responding on this procedure shows that avoidance conditioning can occur without benefit of either classical exteroceptive stimuli or covert stimuli inferred from the temporal constancies of a procedure. It also shows that reduction in shock rate is alone sufficient to maintain avoidance...|$|E
40|$|Key {{pressing}} {{was maintained}} under a fixed-ratio schedule in which electric shock {{was scheduled for}} delivery at a fixed time (t seconds) after each stimulus onset, and every nth response terminated the stimulus and initiated a timeout from shock. Under this procedure, the higher the rate of responding, the briefer {{the duration of the}} stimulus presentation and the lower the frequency of shock delivery. The effects of several schedule parameters were studied to determine whether the maintenance of responding was dependent on an inverse relation between response rate and <b>shock</b> <b>frequency.</b> Shock rate and <b>shock</b> <b>frequency</b> were made independent of response rate by decreasing the value of t to 0. 5 second and delivering shock only during the first presentation of the stimulus after a fixed time, including stimulus and timeout durations, had elapsed since the previous shock. The experiments showed that <b>shock</b> <b>frequency</b> and response rate are inversely related when t is of relatively long duration compared to the value of the fixed-ratio parameter, but that a decrease in shock rate or frequency due to a high rate of responding is not necessary for the maintenance of responding under a fixed-ratio schedule of stimulus termination...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} simulating {{coal seam}} under forced vibration conditions was conducted. Acceleration response and microseism signal {{during the experiment}} were collected and analyzed. It is found that, with an increasing amount of vibration, the natural frequency of the specimen decreases, and this phenomenon reflects fractures appearing in the specimen. Acceleration response signals show that peaks in <b>shock</b> excitation <b>frequency</b> and <b>shock</b> excitation acceleration affect the acceleration response, which reflects damage to the specimen. When <b>shock</b> excitation <b>frequency</b> nears natural frequency, the acceleration response first decreases and then increases. When resonance occurs, it reaches its maximum value. As shock excitation acceleration peaks increase, the acceleration response peak of the specimen also increases. We conclude that destruction is mainly concentrated in the coal seam evidenced by specimen destruction situation.

40|$|Background: Predischarge {{defibrillation}} threshold {{testing is}} often performed {{a few days}} after ICD implantation in order to validate defibrillation thresholds obtained at the time of implant. Ventricular fibrillation is induced with such testing and causes an increase in serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels. BNP is an indicator for cardiac stress. We wanted to examine the feasibility to alter the trend of BNP after predischarge testing in VVI, DDD and CRT ICD´s. Methods: We measured BNP before predischarge testing and 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes after predischarge testing in 13 groups with each 20 patients. We evaluated patients without post shock pacing and patients with a post <b>shock</b> pacing <b>frequency</b> of 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 bpm and a duration of 30 and 60 sec as well as a post <b>shock</b> pacing <b>frequency</b> of 80 and 90 bpm and a duration of 120 sec post shock pacing. Results: Patients without post shock pacing showed the highest BNP during the follow-up. The percentage values of BNP increased consistent significantly after 5 minutes compared with BNP before predischarge testing. The percentage values of BNP trend was significantly lower with a post shock pacing of 90 bpm and duration of 60 sec. In addition, we excluded a cardiac necrosis by predischarge testing because of similar values of myoglobin, cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase during the follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggested that post shock pacing with 90 bpm and duration of 60 sec as the best optimized post <b>shock</b> pacing <b>frequency</b> and duration for VVI, DDD and CRT ICD´s. A reduction of cardiac stress is going to be achieved with the optimization of the post <b>shock</b> pacing <b>frequency</b> and duration...|$|R

In Experiment 1, response suppression was compared across components of a multiple fixed-ratio, random-ratio, fixed-interval, random-interval schedule, at relative conditioned-stimulus/intertrial-interval durations of 1 / 1, 1 / 4, and 1 / 9. In Experiment 2, relative conditioned-stimulus/intertrial-interval duration (1 / 5, 3 / 3, or 5 / 1) was manipulated across groups, while <b>shock</b> <b>frequency</b> (2, 6, or 10 shocks/hr) was manipulated within groups. In both experiments, suppression during the signal was virtually complete at all relative durations. Responding was also suppressed during the intertrial interval, but that suppression varied as a function of experimental manipulations. In Experiment 1, intertrial-interval response rates were higher when relative signal duration was 1 / 9 than when it was 1 / 1, although both relative signal duration and <b>shock</b> <b>frequency,</b> which covaried, could have contributed to the difference. In Experiment 2, the patterning of response rates between successive shocks was affected by relative duration, absolute rates during the intertrial interval varied as a function of <b>shock</b> <b>frequency,</b> and differences between suppression during the signal and suppression during the intertrial interval were affected by both relative duration and <b>shock</b> <b>frequency.</b> The data support an analysis based upon relationships between shock-correlated and intertrial-interval stimuli and, as assessed by the relative-delay-to-reinforcement metric, are comparable to results that have been reported from experiments using similar manipulations under the autoshaping paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Three {{negative}} reinforcement experiments employing a key-peck response are described. In Experiment I, pigeons shocked {{on the average}} of twice per minute (imposed condition) could produce, by pecking a key, an alternate condition with correlated stimuli.

Two of three pigeons continued to peck despite a 100 % increase in <b>shock</b> <b>frequency.</b> In Experiment II, pigeons were shocked in the imposed condition four times per minute. The postresponse delay to shock was held constant by delivering, in the alternate condition, the next shock, or the next two, three, or four shocks from the imposed-condition shock schedule.

Two {{aspects of the}} schedule of response-produced shock were varied: the frequency of punishment over time (punishment density) and the temporal interval between the punished response and the punishment (punishment delay). The general finding was that response-produced shock suppressed avoidance responding under most of the density-delay combinations studied, and suppression increased {{as a function of}} increases in density and decreases in delay. Rate increases of small magnitude also were observed, usually as an initial reaction to the lesser densities and longer delays. Response suppression, while decreasing the number of punishment shocks received, also increased the number of avoidance shocks, so that the total number of shocks received usually was greater than the minimal number possible.
