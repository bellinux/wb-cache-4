25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007 the band went on the Bad Boys of Rock tour, {{supporting}} Hinder. During the tour frontman Jacoby Shaddix and Hinder lead singer Austin John created a very tight friendship, causing the band to tour with Hinder on multiple tours in later years. It was revealed in 2015 that Shaddix and Austin wrote and recorded a song together for a part of Austin John's solo project, although the two {{said they were not}} for sure if the song would ever <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day.|$|E
25|$|One {{version that}} did <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> {{day was the}} Metro 25, which {{featured}} an increased passenger capacity of 25 {{at the expense of}} the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a passenger door on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod for baggage. A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989. Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another jet-powered aircraft with TFE731s in over-wing pods.|$|E

25|$|An earlier cut of {{the film}} seems to have {{included}} a large subplot regarding aliens in the extraterrestrial sense, whose presence was made gradually more and more known throughout, and who were planning to siphon off the planet's resources gradually, placing the humans in the same light as the penguins. At the end, through {{the plight of the}} main character, their hand is stayed and, instead, first contact is made.

25|$|In 1992, McDonnell Douglas {{unveiled}} {{a study of}} a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the double deck concept would not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|As {{the head}} of a family, Hazlitt was now more than ever in need of money. Through William Godwin, with whom he was {{frequently}} in touch, he obtained a commission to write an English grammar, published on 11 November 1809 as A New and Improved Grammar of the English Tongue. Another project that came his way was the work that was published as Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft, a compilation of autobiographical writing by the recently deceased playwright, novelist, and radical political activist, together with additional material by Hazlitt himself. Though completed in 1810, this work did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day until 1816, and so provided no financial gain to satisfy the needs of a young husband and father. Hazlitt in the meantime had not forsaken his painterly ambitions. His environs at Winterslow afforded him opportunities for landscape painting, and he spent considerable time in London procuring commissions for portraits.|$|E

25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and “never... <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

500|$|Given that Gibraltar was a {{small town}} {{with only a few}} defences {{protecting}} it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar. This [...] "town" [...] inside the Rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital. Some soldiers posted here would not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day for months on end. Two Canadian engineer companies, the only soldiers with diamond-tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies, added some [...] of such tunnels, a feat thought impossible at the time. That was enough to hold all 30,000 troops on the rock. Today, the rock has more underground tunnels than roads.|$|E
500|$|The {{gatefold}} {{cover of}} the vinyl LP features the band posing nude in a brook. The shot was original manager Phil Walden's idea, and the brook was on his brother Alan's property. Alan later recalled, [...] "The [...] photo was taken in Round Oak, Georgia, down behind my log cabin there, {{which is also the}} back of Otis Redding's Big O Ranch". Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner was present with Boz Scaggs, whom he was producing at the time. They brought bubbles to cover themselves up, but the bubbles were washed away by the stream. Trucks had sliced his leg open earlier that day, requiring thirteen stitches, and was unable to get in the water; he is standing behind Oakley in the shot. Walden suggested the band take a few shots standing full-frontal; the band was reluctant but he assured them they would never <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day. At their first performance at the Fillmore East that December, Trucks discovered the full-frontal shots were printed in a broadsheet alternative newspaper.|$|E

500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits.

500|$|A planned film {{adaption}} of Year Zero {{became a}} television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched {{the idea to}} television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is [...] "still churning along", {{and that he had}} begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender.

Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated [...] "Basically, it's Goonies." [...] "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage {{in search of the}} deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at US$2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One 1UP.com reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the [...] "complete" [...] Oblivion. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, [...] "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." [...] Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming PS3 release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: [...] "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business." [...] Joystiq continued to comment on the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] add-on in their notice of the quest's release. [...] "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" [...] On July 13, [...] "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called [...] "Deepscorn Hollow" [...] for players bitten with Oblivions vampirism bug, was released. Like the [...] "Orrery" [...] and the [...] "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set [...] "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88.
