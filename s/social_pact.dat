40|$|This paper {{provides}} the scientific {{framework for the}} NEWGOV project Distributive Politics, Learning and Reform. In Part I, we establish our own definition and conceptualization of <b>social</b> <b>pacts.</b> We distinguish four types of pacts with different scope and depth: shadow pacts, headline pacts, coordinated wage setting, and embedded pacts akin to neocorporatist concertation. Part II is concerned with institutional formation, i. e. how such <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> come into existence. We outline some standard functionalist accounts of institutional emergence, and critically examine them before proposing an alternative bargaining model. Part III is concerned with institutional development, i. e. what determines the continuation and institutionalization of <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> or their de-institutionalization and demise. Based on the taxonomy of <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> presented in Part I, we define two alternative evolutionary paths for <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> (institutionalization and de-institutionalization), and identify three types of trajectory along which <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> develop (repetition vs. abandonment; integration vs. disintegration; and expansion vs. reduction). We then outline four alternative mechanisms that may potentially drive the institutionalization or de-institutionalization of pacts. Grounded in the four major approaches for analysing institutions, i. e. the functionalist, utilitarian, normative, and power-distributional perspectives, this section proposes four groups of hypotheses to be evaluated in our empirical research. comparative public policy; political economy; sociological institutionalism; corporatism; policy learning; policy networks; organization theory; interest intermediation...|$|R
25|$|In 1981, the Parti Québécois {{government}} redefined Hydro-Québec's mission by {{modifying the}} terms of the <b>social</b> <b>pact</b> of 1944. The government issued itself 43,741,090 shares worth C$100 each, and the amended statute stated that Hydro-Québec would now pay up to 75% of its net earnings in dividends. This amendment to the Hydro-Québec Act started an episodic debate on whether Hydro-Québec should be fully or partially privatized. In recent years, economist Marcel Boyer and businessman Claude Garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank The Montreal Economic Institute—have often raised the issue, claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt.|$|E

Latin was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule. Saint Augustine observed that Romans preferred for Latin to be adopted per pacem societatis, through a <b>social</b> <b>pact.</b> This language policy contrasts with that of Alexander, who aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language.

60|$|The unflinching {{application}} of principles is seldom {{achieved by the}} men who first launch them. The labour of the preliminary task seems to exhaust one man's stock of mental force. Rousseau never thought of the subversion of society or its reorganisation on a communistic basis.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>pacts</b> {{have long}} been a {{centerpiece}} of European politics. They are characterized by negotiations among government, employers, workers, and other interest groups over wages and other economic issues.

Particular focus is placed on the role of trade unions, and the positive role they can play for economic and social stability by agreeing to set wages {{on the basis of a}} target rate of inflation.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>pacts</b> – policy {{agreements}} between governments, {{labor unions and}} sometimes employer organizations – began to emerge in many countries in the 1980 s. The most common explanations for <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> {{tend to focus on}} economic factors, influenced by industrial relations institutions such as highly coordinated collective bargaining. This book presents, and tests, an alternative and complementary explanation highlighting the electoral calculations made by political parties in choosing pacts. Using a dataset covering 16 European countries for the years 1980 - 2006, as well as eight in-depth country case studies, the authors argue that governments’ choice of <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> or legislation is less influenced by economic problems, but is strongly influenced by electoral competition. <b>Social</b> <b>pacts</b> will be attractive when party leaders perceive them to be helpful in reducing the potential electoral costs of economic adjustment and wage restraint policies. Alternatively, parties may forgo negotiations with social partners and seek to impose such policies unilaterally if they believe that approach will yield electoral gain or minimize electoral costs. By combining the separate literatures on political economy and party politics, the book sheds new light on the dynamics of <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> in Western Europe.

6000|$|So again let us {{consider}} the statement that the instant the government usurps the sovereignty, then the <b>social</b> <b>pact</b> is broken, and all the citizens, restored by right to their natural liberty, are forced but not morally obliged to obey.[267] He began by telling his readers that man, though born free, is now everywhere in chains; and therefore {{it would appear that}} in all existing cases the <b>social</b> <b>pact</b> has been broken, and the citizens living under the reign of force, are free to resume their natural liberty, if they are only strong enough to do so. This declaration of the general duty of rebellion no doubt had its share in generating that fervid eagerness that all other peoples should rise and throw off the yoke, {{which was one of the}} most astonishing anxieties of the French during their revolution. That was not the worst quality of such a doctrine. It made government impossible, by basing the right or duty of resistance on a question that could not be reached by positive evidence, but must always be decided by an arbitrary interpretation of an arbitrarily imagined document. The moderate proposition that resistance is lawful if a government is a bad one, and if the people are strong enough to overthrow it, and if their leaders have reason to suppose they can provide a less bad one in its place, supplies tests that are capable of application. Our own writers in favour of the doctrine of resistance partly based their arguments upon the historic instances of the Old Testament, and it is one of the most striking contributions of Protestantism to the cause of freedom, that it sent people in an admiring spirit to the history of the most rebellious nation that ever existed, and so provided them in Hebrew insurgency with a corrective for the too submissive political teaching of the Gospel. But these writers have throughout a tacit appeal to expediency, as writers might always be expected to have, who were really meditating on the possibility of their principles being brought to the test of practice. There can be no evidence possible, with a test so vague as the fact of the rupture of a compact whose terms are authentically known to nobody concerned. Speak of bad laws and good, wise administration or unwise, just government or unjust, extravagant or economical, civically elevating or demoralising; all these are questions which men may apply themselves to settle with knowledge, and with a more or less definite degree of assurance. But who can tell how he is to find out whether sovereignty has been usurped, and the social compact broken? Was there a usurpation of sovereignty in France not many years ago, when the assumption of power by the prince was ratified by many millions of votes? ...|$|E
6000|$|Apart {{from these}} arithmetical conceptions, {{and the deep}} charm which their {{assurance}} of expression had for the narrow and fervid minds of which England and Germany seem to have got finally rid in Anabaptists and Fifth Monarchy men, but which still haunted France, there were maxims in the Social Contract of remarkable convenience {{for the members of}} a Committee of Public Safety. [...] "How can a blind multitude," [...] the writer asks in one place, [...] "which so often does not know its own will, because it seldom knows what is good for it, execute of itself an undertaking so vast and so difficult as a system of legislation?"[206] Again, [...] "as nature gives to each man an absolute power over all his members, so the <b>social</b> <b>pact</b> gives to the body politic an absolute power over all its members; and it is this same power which, when directed by the general will, bears, as I have said, the name of sovereignty."[207] Above all, the little chapter on a dictatorship is the very foundation of the position of the Robespierrists in the few months immediately preceding their fall. [...] "It is evidently the first intention of the people that the state should not perish," [...] and so on, with much criticism of the system of occasional dictatorships, as they were resorted to in old Rome.[208] Yet this does not in itself go much beyond the old monarchic doctrine of Prerogative, as a corrective for the slowness and want of immediate applicability of mere legal processes in cases of state emergency; and it is worth noticing again and again that in spite of the shriekings of reaction, the few atrocities of the Terror are an almost invisible speck compared with the atrocities of Christian churchmen and lawful kings, perpetrated in accordance with their notion of what constituted public safety. So far as Rousseau's intention goes, we find in his writings one of the strongest denunciations of the doctrine of public safety that {{is to be found in}} any of the writings of the century. [...] "Is the safety of a citizen," [...] he cries, [...] "less the common cause than the safety of the state? They may tell us that it is well that one should perish on behalf of all. I will admire such a sentence in the mouth of a virtuous patriot, who voluntarily and for duty's sake devotes himself to death for the salvation of his country. But if we are to understand that it is allowed to the government to sacrifice an innocent person for the safety of the multitude, I hold this maxim for one of the most execrable that tyranny has ever invented, and the most dangerous that can be admitted."[209] It may be said that the Terrorists did not sacrifice innocent life, but the plea is frivolous on the lips of men who proscribed whole classes. You cannot justly draw a capital indictment against a class. Rousseau, however, cannot fairly be said to have had a share in the responsibility for the more criminal part of the policy of 1793, any more than the founder of Christianity is responsible for the atrocities that have been committed by the more ardent worshippers of his name, and justified by stray texts caught up from the gospels. Helvétius had said, [...] "All becomes legitimate and even virtuous on behalf of the public safety." [...] Rousseau wrote in the margin, [...] "The public safety is nothing unless individuals enjoy security."[210] The author of a theory is not answerable for the applications which may be read into it by the passions of men and the exigencies of a violent crisis. Such applications show this much and no more, that the theory was constructed with an imperfect consideration of the qualities of human nature, with too narrow a view of the conditions of society, and therefore with an inadequate appreciation of the consequences which the theory might be drawn to support.|$|E

40|$|From the introduction]. <b>Social</b> <b>pacts</b> – national-level {{agreements}} between governments, {{labor unions and}} sometimes employer organizations – began to emerge in many Western European countries in the 1980 s. Although on the surface, these agreements seemed to bear some resemblance to the neo-corporatist arrangements of the 1970 s, several features made them notable and distinct. First, they were signed in countries that did not conform to the characteristics usually identified with neo-corporatism, such {{as the presence of}} leftist governments, and strong and centralized social partners. Second, the pacts varied significantly in their contents, including issues as diverse as wage levels, work time, labor market or industrial relations reform, welfare reform, and training. In this paper, we aim to explain the emergence of <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> in West European countries. We are particularly interested in explaining the variation of the existence of pacts both across and within countries. That is, why do some countries feature a long list of <b>social</b> <b>pacts,</b> while others have few or none? And second, why do some governments pursue <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> as their preferred way to change policies during certain time periods, but choose the legislative route at other times? In exploring these questions, we diverge from the prevalent explanation centered on economic pressures and instead highlight electoral dynamics. We argue that <b>social</b> <b>pacts</b> will be attractive when party leaders perceive them to be helpful in reducing the potential electoral costs of economic adjustment and wage restraint policies. Alternatively, parties may forgo negotiations with social partners and seek to impose such policies unilaterally if they believe that approach will yield electoral gain or minimize electoral costs. The paper proceeds as follows: The first section will present a brief overview of the dominant explanations of <b>social</b> <b>pacts,</b> focusing on economic pressures and institutions. The second part will ground our argument in existing theoretical and empirical work on parties, governments, and voting behavior. The third section discusses some initial results based on a 16 -country comparison of <b>social</b> <b>pacts.</b> Although these results are preliminary and tentative, they indicate the directions our future research will take.

Rather, governments can threaten trade unions with tight monetary policy and trade unions can either engage in negotiated adjustment or suffer restrictions. <b>Social</b> <b>pacts</b> are therefore an instrument of adjustment by governments to a new economic environment, and not a tool of economic policy.
