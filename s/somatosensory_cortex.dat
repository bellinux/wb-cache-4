5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>cortex</b> in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E

In humans, one symptom of FXS is hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, including touch. We used a mouse model of FXS (Fmr 1 KO) to study sensory processing of tactile information conveyed via the whisker system. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in <b>somatosensory</b> barrel <b>cortex</b> showed layer-specific broadening of the receptive fields {{at the level of}} layer 2 / 3 but not layer 4, in response to whisker stimulation. Furthermore, the encoding of tactile stimuli at different frequencies was severely affected in layer 2 / 3.

In this task the Fmr 1 KO mice showed differences in the number of whisker contacts with platforms, decrease in the whisker sampling duration and reduction in the whisker touch-time while performing the task.

The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping (premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, primary <b>somatosensory</b> <b>cortex,</b> parietal cortex, {{and back to}} the premotor cortex).

25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping is {{used for}} somatotopy to determine {{the areas of the}} cerebral cortex that connect through nerve fibers with different body parts. Cortical stimulation identifies which regions of the brain are vital for certain functions, thereby allowing a 'map' to be made which can be used to decide if brain areas are safe to remove.

An example is the cortical homunculus of the primary motor cortex and the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>cortex,</b> which are separated by the central sulcus.

25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>cortex</b> for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons.

The recovery of the independent function at the ipsilateral side, however, depends on neural circuitry reorganization in the central nervous system (CNS). This study tried to locate the CNS neuronal elements involved in the innervation of C 7 spinal nerve. Method: Pseudorabies virus (PRV, TK/gG-, 2 祃), which expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP), was injected into the left C 7 spinal nerve in 20 adult Sprague Dawley rats. After rats survived for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h, the C 1 -C 7 segments of the spinal cord and brain were processed using a polyclonal immunohistochemical antibody against PRV. Results: PRV-labeled neurons were found mainly in gray matter of the C 1 -C 7 segments of the spinal cord and at the following structures of the brain: lateral vestibular nucleus, lateral paragigantocellular nucleus, A 5 cells, red nucleus, primary and secondary motor cortexes, primary and secondary <b>somatosensory</b> <b>cortexes.</b> Although located bilaterally, the PRV-labeled neurons existed predominantly in the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord and the contralateral side of the brain at 6 - 12 h after injection (p. i.). The number of PRV-labeled neurons in the CNS was increasing with rat抯 survival time and the distribution of these neurons turned bilateral with no obvious dominance to either side at 24 h and 36 h (p. i.).
