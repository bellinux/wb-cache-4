The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for laser <b>scabbling.</b> This was achieved in three stages. The first stage was a test series used to establish an experimental procedure for assessing the effects of various parameters that may be critical for the effectiveness of the process, such as material composition and initial moisture content.

40|$|Laser {{concrete}} <b>scabbling</b> is {{the process}} by which the surface layer of concrete may be removed {{through the use of a}} low power density laser beam. The main aim of this investigation was to establish relationships between laser interaction time and volume removal for a wide range of material compositions, including different w/b ratios, binder compositions (OPC/PFA), aggregate/binder ratios and coarse aggregate sizes. The results show that 25 % replacement of ordinary Portland cement with pulverised fuel ash and/or a reduced water/binder ratio improves the efficiency of <b>scabbling</b> of cement pastes. Mortars and cement pastes were seen to scabble at a constant rate, whereas concretes experienced a peak rate, after which volume removal reduced dramatically. Basalt aggregate concrete was less susceptible to laser <b>scabbling</b> than limestone aggregate concrete. The effects of composition on the mechanisms which drive laser <b>scabbling</b> are discussed.

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) has {{numerous}} {{buildings and}} facilities {{that have become}} contaminated through operation of nuclear reactors, fuel fabrication processes, and research laboratory operations. These buildings and facilities, often constructed of concrete, need to be decontaminated {{before they can be}} safely decommissioned or demolished. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory`s concrete spaller is a hand-held tool {{that can be used for}} decontaminating flat or slightly curved concrete surfaces, obtaining concrete samples, and in-depth removal from cracks in concrete. The concrete spaller includes a 9 -ton hydraulic cylinder and spalling bit. It runs from a hydraulic pump that expands the spaller in pre-drilled holes in the concrete. The result is removal of concrete chunks that fall into the attached metal shroud. The concrete spaller is more efficient than traditional tools such as hand-held pneumatic scabblers and scalers. For example, the spaller is capable of spalling 1. 3 m{sup 3 }/hr (0. 23 ft{sup 2 }/min), compared to 1. 1 m{sup 2 }/hr (0. 20 ft{sup 2 }/min), for the baseline <b>scabbler</b> and scaler demonstrated at 3 -mm (1 / 8 -in.) depth.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} on a reinforced concrete (RC) strengthening technique {{carried out by}} the authors, using surface bonding steel plates (SBSP). To accomplish this investigation, the tension face of one-way spanning RC slabs was <b>scabbled</b> and bonded with one or two sandblasted steel plate(s) of different thicknesses, using epoxy glue. The steel plate thicknesses were varied in order to deter-mine the width-to-thickness ratios that can promote yielding (and not premature debonding) of the RC slabs before failure. A low flexural reinforcement percentage (â‰ˆ 0. 314 % bh) was used in order to prevent over-reinforcement and to ensure that failure of the slabs under static loading was due to flexure. Static two-point line loading was adopted to simulate the worse loading condition. Based on the deformation response of the slabs, the most appropriate parameters of the steel plates, for strengthening distressing reinforced concrete slabs were determined. The SBSP strengthening technique was found to possess effective composite proper-ties as all the strengthened RC slabs failed essentially by flexural yielding before steel plate separation, with enhanced load carrying capacity of at least 89 % above that of control slabs...|$|R

Corrective Action Unit 117 comprises Corrective Action Site (CAS) 26 - 41 - 01, Pluto Disassembly Facility, located in Area 26 of the Nevada Test Site. The purpose of this CR is to provide documentation supporting the completed corrective actions and provide data confirming that the closure objectives for CAU 117 were met. To achieve this, the following actions were performed: â€¢ Review the current site conditions, including the concentration and extent of contamination. â€¢ Implement any corrective actions necessary to protect human health and the environment. â€¢ Properly dispose of corrective action and investigation wastes. â€¢ Document Notice of Completion and closure of CAU 117 issued by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. From May 2008 through February 2009, closure activities were performed as set forth in the Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration Plan for Corrective Action Unit 117, Area 26 Pluto Disassembly Facility, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. The purpose of the activities as defined during the data quality objectives process were: â€¢ Determine whether contaminants of concern (COCs) are present. â€¢ If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent, implement appropriate corrective actions, and properly dispose of wastes. Analytes detected during the closure activities were evaluated against final action levels to determine COCs for CAU 117. Assessment of the data generated from closure activities indicated that the final action levels were exceeded for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reported as total Aroclor and radium- 226. A corrective action was implemented to remove approximately 50 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil, approximately 1 cubic foot of radium- 226 contaminated soil (and <b>scabbled</b> asphalt), and a high-efficiency particulate air filter that was determined to meet the criteria of a potential source material (PSM). Electrical and lighting components (i. e., PCB-containing ballasts and capacitors) and other materials (e. g., mercury-containing thermostats and switches, lead plugs and bricks) assumed to be PSM were also removed from Building 2201, as practical, without the need for sampling. Because the COC contamination and PSMs have been removed, clean closure of CAS 26 - 41 - 01 is recommended, and no use restrictions are required to be placed on this CAU. No further action is necessary because no other contaminants of potential concern were found above preliminary action levels. The physical end state for Building 2201 is expected to be eventual demolition to slab. The DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office provides the following recommendations: â€¢ Clean closure is the recommended corrective action for CAS 26 - 41 - 01 in CAU 117. â€¢ A Notice of Completion to the DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 117. â€¢ Corrective Action Unit 117 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: External bonding {{of steel}} plates to {{structural}} concrete members has widely gained popularity in recent years, particularly for repairing and strengthening reinforced concrete beams. The {{success of this}} bonding technique depends {{on the effectiveness of}} the surface preparation of the steel and concrete beams. Studies have shown that most of the beams strengthened using this technique usually fail prematurely by debonding. In this study, concrete beams with different types of surface preparations were investigated, such as no surface preparation (NSP), wire brushing (WB), <b>scabbling</b> (SC) and hand chipping (HC). The quality of the surface preparation established was measured based on the flexural performance of the externally strengthened steel-concrete beams. Eight (8), 250 x 450 x 3600 mm reinforced concrete beams were prepared and strengthened with glued steel plates on their soffits. All the specimens were tested under two-point static loading and failure modes were observed. The results showed that beams with rougher surface preparation have a high bond strength as compared to smoother surface preparations. The increase in the average capacity of strengthened beams with the surface prepared by hand-chipping, <b>scabbling,</b> wire brushing was found to be 75. 3 %, 67. 5 % and 46. 9 % respectively, compared to the capacity of the beam strengthened without surface preparation...|$|E

Grinder consumables (i. e., replacement diamond grinding wheel) are {{more expensive than the}} replacement carbide parts for the scaler and scabbler. However, operating costs are outweighed by the lower purchase price of the grinder (50 % of the price of the baseline scaler and 8 % of the price of the baseline scabbler). Overall, the concrete grinder is an attractive alternative to traditional <b>scabbling</b> and scaling pneumatic tools. To this end, in July 1998, the outer rod room exposed walls of the Safe Storage Enclosure (SSE), an area measuring approximately 150 m{sup 2 }, may be decontaminated with the hand-held grinder. This concrete grinder technology was demonstrated {{for the first time at}} the DOE`s Hanford Site. Decontamination of a sample room walls was performed at the C Reactor to free release the walls prior to demolition. The demonstration was conducted by onsite D and D workers, who were instructed by the vendor prior to and during the demonstration...|$|E
