It's a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity {{every couple of}} years. PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station. The predominant PV technology is crystalline silicon, while thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>technology</b> accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment. In recent years, PV technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency, reduced the installation cost per watt {{as well as its}} energy payback time, and has reached grid parity in at least 30 different markets by 2014.

He applied the results of his study of thermoelectricity to the construction of an electric thermometer, and measured the temperatures of the interior of animals, of the soil at different depths, and of the atmosphere at different heights.

[...] When the cost of extending power grids, running rural electricity and using diesel generators is compared with the cost of solar cells, many times the solar cells win. [...] If the efficiency and cost of the current <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>technology</b> is decreased even further, then many rural communities and villages around the world could obtain electricity when current methods are out of the question.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a strong {{commercial}} push towards thinner silicon in the solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to the significant cost reduction associated with it. However, in current products made from crystalline <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>technologies,</b> normal in-plane tensile stress resulting in fracture of silicon cells are observed. To further understand this phenomenon, the synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction tool was used to perform stress measurements and mapping of the <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the most typically observed crack initiation location, the solder joint. This technique is unique as it has the capabilities to quantitatively determine the stresses and map these stresses with a micron resolution, all while the silicon cells are in encapsulation. A fundamental understanding of the stress magnitudes as well as microstructural characteristics that could lead to crack initiation and propagation could be obtained with this technique. This also confirms that the control of mechanical stress is the key to enable thin silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>technologies</b> in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|Many recent {{advances}} in novel <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> <b>technologies</b> are based on charge separation in disordered semiconductor heterojunctions. In this work we use the Random Walk Numerical Simulation (RWNS) method to model the dynamics of electrons and holes in two disordered semiconductors in contact. Miller–Abrahams hopping rates and a tunnelling distance-dependent electron–hole annihilation mechanism are used to model transport and recombination, respectively. To test {{the validity of the}} model, three numerical ‘‘experiments’’ have been devised: (1) in the absence of constant illumination, charge separation has been quantified by computing surface photovoltage (SPV) transients. (2) By applying a continuous generation of electron–hole pairs, the model can be used to simulate a <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> under steady-state conditions. This has been exploited to calculate open-circuit voltages and recombination currents for an archetypical bulk heterojunction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> (BHJ). (3) The calculations have been extended to nanostructured <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> with inorganic sensitizers to study, specifically, non-ideality in the recombination rate. The RWNS model in combination with exponential disorder and an activated tunnelling mechanism for transport and recombination is shown to reproduce correctly charge separation parameters in these three ‘‘experiments’’.
