25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as <b>spinach,</b> <b>beet,</b> tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiacloprid in spinach and similar leaves crop group. In order to accommodate the intended indoor and outdoor uses of thiacloprid in Belgium, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiacloprid in spinach and similar leaves group or only in <b>spinach</b> and <b>beet</b> leaves to 0. 15 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue trials data on lettuce are not sufficient to support the residue data extrapolation to the whole group of spinach and similar leaves. Alternatively, the EMS proposed to extrapolate four outdoor residue trials data on open leaf lettuce to <b>spinach</b> and <b>beet</b> leaves only. Although this extrapolation is not explicitly mentioned in the European guidance document, EFSA is of the opinion that the proposal is acceptable, considering the morphological similarities between spinach/beet leaves and open leave varieties of lettuce and taking into account that <b>spinach</b> and <b>beet</b> leaves are minor crops. Thus, a MRL proposal of 0. 15 mg/kg is derived. Based on the risk assessment results EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiacloprid on <b>spinach</b> and <b>beet</b> leaves will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|R

50|$|Chard {{was first}} {{described}} in 1753 by Carl von Linné as Beta vulgaris var. cicla. Its taxonomic rank has changed many times, {{so it was}} treated as a subspecies, convariety or variety of Beta vulgaris. (Some of the numerous synonyms are Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch (Cicla Group), B. vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch var. cicla L., B. vulgaris var. cycla (L.) Ulrich, B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (Leaf Beet Group), B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (<b>Spinach</b> <b>Beet</b> Group), B. vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch (Flavescens Group), B. vulgaris subsp. cicla (L.) W.D.J. Koch var. flavescens (Lam.) DC., B. vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris (Leaf Beet Group), B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris (Swiss Chard Group)). The accepted name for all beet cultivars, like chard, sugar beet and beetroot, is Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris. They are cultivated descendants of the sea beet, Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima. Chard belongs to the chenopods, which are now mostly included in the family Amaranthaceae (sensu lato).|$|E

40|$|This is a {{guide to}} the growing, {{harvesting}} and use of spinach and swiss chard. Spinach Spinach is a cool season crop and belongs to the goosefoot family (Chenopodiaceae), along with Swiss chard and <b>beets.</b> <b>Spinach</b> is low in calories. It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals, especially iron. After washing the leaves, cook them in a covered pan using only the water clinging to the leaves. After cooking, add salt and butter, vinegar, or mustard for added flavor. Spinach may be prepared in a souffle, creamed soup, or used raw in salads. Swiss Chard Swiss chard is a type of beet that is grown for its large leaf stalks and leaves. It produces no enlarged fleshy roots. It is low in calories and minerals and a good source of vitamins A and C. Chard leaves are best prepared like <b>spinach</b> or <b>beet</b> greens - cooking with only the water that clings to them following washing. A bit of garlic or nutmeg and butter enhances the flavor of chard leaves. Chard stems have a delicate flavor much like asparagus and are prepared in a similar way. Stems should be stripped of leaves, cut into conveniently sized pieces, and gently steamed in salted water until tender. Cooked and chilled stems are very good with salad dressing or mayonnaise. Leaves and stems may also be cooked together...|$|R
