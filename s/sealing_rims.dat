40|$|Unsteady flow {{dynamics}} in turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> {{are known to}} be complex and attempts accurately to predict the interaction of the mainstream flow with the secondary air system cooling flows using CFD with RANS turbulence models have proved difficult. In particular, published results from RANS models have overpredicted the sealing effectiveness of the <b>rim</b> <b>seal,</b> although their use in this context continues to be common. Previous authors have ascribed this discrepancy to the failure to model flow structures with a scale greater than can be captured in the small sector models typically used. This paper presents results from a series of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of a turbine stage including a <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> and <b>rim</b> cavity for, it is believed by the authors, the first time.

Comparison is made with previously published experimental data and with unsteady RANS simulations. The LES models are shown to be in closer agreement with the experimental sealing effectiveness than the unsteady RANS simulations.

The post-operation inspection revealed severe steel corrosion along the <b>seal</b> <b>rims.</b> Under SOFC stack conditions rapidly growing oxide nodules were observed bridging the 200 mu m seal gal) between the metallic components after a few hundred hours of operation. These oxide nodules, rich in iron, gave rise to local short-circuiting effects eventually resulting in stack failure. The present study, combined with recent model investigations triggered by the stack results, indicates that severe degradation only occurs in the case of glass-ceramic sealants which contain minor amounts of PbO. Furthermore, the rate of corrosion attack of the metallic components strongly depends on the silicon (Si) content of the ferritic steel. The stack tests suggest that increasing the Si content increases the corrosion rate, and thus detrimentally influences the stack performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper describes experimental measurements which quantify the effect of ingress on both the stator and rotor disks in a wheel-space pressurized by sealing flow. Infrared (IR) sensors were developed and calibrated to accurately measure the temperature history of the rotating disk surface during a transient experiment, leading to an adiabatic effectiveness. The performance of four generic (though engine-representative) single-and double-clearance seals was assessed in terms of the variation of adiabatic effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The measurements identify a so-called thermal buffering effect, where the boundary layer on the rotor protects the disk from the effects of ingress.

Although the ingress through the <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field, and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the time-averaged experimental data are shown to be successfully predicted by relatively simple semi-empirical models, which are described in a separate paper.

A superposed sealant flow, bled from the compressor, is used to purge the wheel-space or at least dilute the ingress to an acceptable level. The ingress is caused by the circumferential variation of pressure in the turbine annulus radially outward of the seal.

The concept behind the finned seal is that the radial fins increase the swirl in the outer wheel-space; measurements of swirl show the captive fluid between the fins rotate with near solid body rotation.

Single-clearance arrangements were considered {{in the form of}} axial- and radial-seal gap configurations. With the radial-seal clearance configuration, CFD steady state solutions were able to predict the system sealing effectiveness over a wide range of coolant mass flow rates reasonably well. The greater insight of flow field provided by the computations illustrates the thermal buffering effect when ingress occurs: for a given sealing flow rate, the effectiveness on the rotor was significantly higher than that on the stator due to the axial flow of hot gases from stator to rotor caused by pumping effects. The predicted effectiveness on the rotor was compared with a theoretical model for the thermal buffering effect showing good agreement. When the axial-seal clearance arrangement is considered, the agreement between CFD and experiments worsens; the variation of sealing effectiveness with coolant flow rate calculated by means of the simulations display a distinct kink. It was found that the ”kink phenomenon” can be ascribed to an over-estimation of the egress spoiling effects due to turbulence modelling limitations.

Egress of sealing flow from the first-stage can be re-ingested in downstream stages. This paper presents experimental results using a 1. 5 -stage test facility designed to investigate ingress into the wheel-spaces upstream and downstream of a rotor disc. Re-ingestion was quantified using measurements of CO 2 concentration, with seeding injected into the upstream and downstream sealing flows. Here a theoretical mixing model has been developed from first principles and validated by the experimental measurements. For the first time, a method to quantify the mass fraction of the fluid carried over from upstream egress into downstream ingress has been presented and measured; it was shown that this fraction increased as the downstream sealing flow rate increased. The upstream purge was shown to not significantly disturb the fluid dynamics but only partially mixes with the annulus flow near the downstream seal, with the ingested fluid emanating from the boundary layer on the blade platform. From the analogy between heat and mass transfer, the measured mass-concentration flux is equivalent to an enthalpy flux and this re-ingestion could significantly reduce the adverse effect of ingress in the downstream wheel-space.

The applicability of LES to flow regimes within a rotor-stator cavity were investigated with reference to two experimental studies, those of Daily & Nece [1] and of Itoh et al. [2]. LES simulations were run using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT and the Rolls-Royce CFD code HYDRA.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} research {{concerned with}} the ingress of hot mainstream gas through the <b>rim</b> <b>seals</b> of gas turbines. It includes experimental, theoretical, and computational studies conducted by many institutions, and the ingress is classified as externally induced (EI), rotationally induced (RI), and combined ingress (CI). Although EI ingress (which {{is caused by the}} circumferential distribution of pressure created by the vanes and blades in the turbine annulus) occurs in all turbines, RI and CI ingress can be important at off-design conditions and for the inner seal of a double-seal geometry. For all three types of ingress, the equations from a simple orifice model are shown to be useful for relating the sealing effectiveness (and therefore the amount of hot gas ingested into the wheel-space of a turbine) to the sealing flow rate. In this paper, experimental data obtained from different research groups have been transformed into a consistent format and reviewed using the orifice model equations. Most of the published results for sealing effectiveness have been made using concentration measurements of a tracer gas (usually CO 2) {{on the surface of the}} stator, and—for a large number of tests with single and double seals—the measured distributions of effectiveness with sealing flow rate are shown to be consistent with those predicted by the model. Although the flow through the <b>rim</b> <b>seal</b> can be treated as inviscid, the flow inside the wheel-space is controlled by the boundary layers on the rotor and stator.

Sealing air, which is supplied to the wheel-space, flows through the seal clearance and joins the mainstream flow. Too much sealing air is inefficient; too little can lead to disastrous consequences. The nozzle guide vanes create three-dimensional (3 D) variations {{in the distribution of}} pressure in the mainstream annulus and the turbine blades create unsteady effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and expensive for these 3 D unsteady flows, and engine designers tend to use correlations or simple models to predict ingress. This paper describes the application of simple ‘orifice models’, the analytical solutions of which can be used to calculate the sealing effectiveness of turbine <b>rim</b> <b>seals.</b> The solutions agree well with available data for externally-induced ingress, where the effects of rotation are negligible, for rotationally-induced ingress, where the effects of the external flow are small, and for combined ingress, where the effects of both external flow and rotation are significant...|$|R
