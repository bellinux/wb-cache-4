30|$|Ceramic brackets, {{whether they}} are single crystal sapphire, {{polycrystalline}} alumina, or zirconia, relative to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> (SS) <b>brackets,</b> have poor frictional properties [13, 20, 21]. To combat this, aesthetic ceramic brackets with metallic slot have been developed [22, 23]. Compared to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets,</b> titanium brackets have more surface roughness [24, 25]. Self-ligating brackets [26 – 28] with low-friction and full bracket engagement of the archwire, which is easy to use, assist good oral hygiene and is comfortable for the patient. But because of its partially reduced torquing capacity and high cost, conventional brackets are widely being used [29]. The above studies reveal that conventional metallic brackets are widely used than ceramic, zirconia, titanium, and self-ligating brackets either due to their properties or cost factor. Hence, the present study evaluated the conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> are {{composed}} of various metal that may corrode in oral cavity. Corrosion {{is caused by the}} release of metal ions such as chromium, nickel, and iron. The release of metal ions can cause adverse effects such as toxicity, allergic, and mutagenicity. To evaluate the biocompatibility of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets,</b> micronucleus assay as one of genotoxicity assay is used in this study. To determine the differences and the correlation of metal ions release and genotoxic activity among three brand <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets.</b> METHODS: Three brands of brackets were immersed in artificial saliva for 672 hours and the release of ion chromium, nikel and iron were examined. The cytokynesis block micronucleus assay (CBMN) using lymphocytes was performed as well. RESULTS: The highest metal releasing were nickel, cromium, iron, respectively (30. 5, 27. 2, 23. 4 ppb). There was a significant differences between total nickel and iron ion release among three brand brackets (p= 0. 04, p= 0. 02). Genotoxicity of metal ion released was correlated with durration of immersion brackets (p= 0. 01). Genotoxicity was significant correlated with the release of chromium (p= 0. 03) and nickel (p= 0. 01).

40|$|Comparison of the {{frictional}} {{characteristics of}} aesthetic orthodontic brackets measured using a modified in vitro technique Objective: The coefficients of friction (COFs) of aesthetic ceramic and stain-less steel brackets {{used in conjunction}} with stainless steel archwires were investigated using a modified linear tribometer and special computer software, and the effects of the bracket slot size (0. 018 inches [in] or 0. 022 in) and materials (ceramic or metal) on the COF were determined. Methods: Four types of ceramic (one with a stainless steel slot) and one conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> were tested with two types of archwire sizes: a 0. 017 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 018 -in slots and a 0. 019 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 022 -in slot brackets. For pairwise comparisons between the 0. 018 -in and 0. 022 -in slot sizes in the same bracket, an independent sample t-test was used. One-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post-hoc test at the 95 % confidence level (α = 0. 05) were also used for statistical analyses. Results: There were significant differences between the 0. 022 -in and 0. 018 -in slot sizes for the same brand of bracket. ANOVA also showed that both slot size and bracket slot material had significant effects on COF values (p < 0. 001). The ceramic bracket with a 0. 022 -in stainless steel slot showed the lowest mean COF (m = 0. 18), followed by the conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> with a 0. 022 -in slot (m = 0. 21). The monocrystalline alumina ceramic bracket with a 0. 018 -in slot had the highest COF (m = 0. 85). Conclusions: Brackets with stainless steel slots exhibit lower COFs than ceramic slot brackets. All brackets show lower COFs as the slot size increases. [Korean J Orthod 2015; 45 (1) : 29 - 37...|$|E
30|$|The bond {{strength}} between an orthodontic bracket and a laminate veneer should {{be sufficient to}} withstand the forces generated by mastication, last the duration of orthodontic treatment but allow straightforward removal {{at the end of}} treatment without damage to the underlying restoration. The minimum {{bond strength}} for orthodontic purposes falls within the range of 6 to 8 MPa [19]. It has also been reported that the minimum bond strength needed by a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> to be clinically acceptable is 2.86 MPa [32]. In the present study, bond strengths for brackets bonded to composite laminate surfaces pre-treated with both diamond bur and microetcher lie approximately within this acceptable range, being higher than the former. However, significantly high bond strength between the adhesive resin and a restoration has disadvantages. Fracture or loss of the underlying restoration during debonding can occur. Additionally, sandblasting with aluminum oxide particles (microetcher) may be safer than utilizing burs or stones, since the procedure is more uniform and less aggressive [33].|$|E
30|$|Many {{previous}} studies [1, 2, 6, 17, 19, 20, 24, 31 – 37] {{have been done}} on surface roughness.

But the present study evaluated the surface roughness of stainless steel brackets itself with the help of the 3 D non-contact optical surface profilometer machine and SEM. There was no comparison of friction of the stainless steel brackets with the other materials like wires or ligation technique. So the study was focussed on evaluating the surface roughness in three dimensions of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> slot which can help to determine the clinical performance of the bracket, the accuracy of bracket slot dimension and bracket slot roughness.

30|$|ARI {{scores are}} {{influenced}} by the type of bracket, debonding technique, adhesive type, and the bonding technique used [24, 29]. Metallic brackets have a tendency to fail mainly at the bracket-adhesive interface, which leaves the remaining adhesive to be removed from the enamel surface [24, 30]. The ARI scores in the present study are in agreement with the findings previously reported for metallic brackets [24, 30] as most of the adhesive remained on the enamel for titanium bracket followed by <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket.</b> For ceramic bracket, less adhesive remained on the enamel which could probably cause enamel damage; however, in the present study, the ceramic brackets showed the lowest maximum principal stresses on enamel in all testing modes. Consequently, negligible enamel damage could occur, and this finding is in agreement with previous studies [23, 25, 26]. The use of shear forces to remove orthodontic brackets would result in a reduced risk of enamel fracture when compared to tensile forces (Figures  3, 4, 5). This finding is in agreement with Rossouw and Terblanche [31].|$|E

Methods: Three types of stainless steel and nickel titanium alloy (niti) esthetic orthodontic archwires (epoxy, poly, plastic) in four sizes (. 016,. 018,. 017 x. 025,. 019 x. 025 inches) were ligated to both a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> system and a ceramic (esthetic) bracket system and pulled by a Universal testing machine for 90 seconds. Two types of control wires were also tested (stainless steel, niti). Each of these wires was tested 10 times. The mean frictional values were recorded for each wire in pounds. An ANOVA analysis was done to compare frictional differences between the different esthetic fixed bracket systems and a T-test was done to compare the frictional differences between wires tested in stainless steel brackets and those tested in ceramic brackets. Thickness of each of the esthetic archwires was measured with digital calipers and the means recorded. Results: Of the 14 groups tested using the ANOVA, only 1 was not significant. Of the 13 statistically significant groups, all but 4 of those groups showed that the non-coated archwires systems had increased frictional values. Of the 28 t-tests done to compare frictional differences between archwires tested with stainless steel brackets and those tested with ceramic brackets, 22 were statistically significant. In the 22 significant groups, all but three showed a statistically significant increase in friction in wires tested using ceramic brackets.

To excite the device, high frequency voltage (between 5 and 10  KHz) was applied through the piezo-transducers, which affects the tooth by means of the vibration of the wire. High frequency mechanical vibrations allowed the appraisal of the mechanical response from the supporting substances. Mechanical responses associated with the stiffness of the support were quantified with the electrical impedance of the piezo-transducers. The device was coupled to the crown of a canine tooth simulating a condition of fixing as in the bone, the tooth was fastened by the root portion inside the supporting substance. Four supporting substances were characterized for the tests. After establishing base values of the stiffness of each supporting substance, the stiffness variations were assessed in two stages (two drillings); these were made perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the tooth, Results show that it is possible to assess stiffness variations with the proposed methodology as well as to quantify the stiffness differences, by means of variation indexes...|$|E

Slot Deformation in Various <b>Stainless</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Bracket</b> Products due to The Torqueing Force of Beta Titanium Wire. <b>Stainless</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>bracket</b> slot {{deformation}} affects force {{applied to}} teeth. The research aims to determine slot deformation of five different bracket brands namely, 3 M, Biom, Versadent, Ormco and Shinye due to torque of Beta Titanium wire 0. 021 x 0. 025 inch with torsional angle of 45 ° {{and the amount}} of torque with torsional angle of 30 ° and 45 °. The research also attempts to compare the deformation and amount of torque among all five bracket brands. Fifity Stainless Steel Edgewise brackets from five bracket group brands (n= 10) were attached on acrylic. Bracket slot measurement was carried out in two stages: firstly, deformation measurement by calculating average bracket slot height with stereoscopy microscope before and after application of torque; and secondly, measurement of torque with a torque measurement apparatus. Statistical analysis showed that there are slot deformations on the five bracket brands with clinical permanent deformation on Biom (2, 79 µm) and Shinye (2, 29 µm). The amount of torque on the five bracket brands from the highest is 3 M, Ormco, Versadent, Shinye and Biom. From correlation assessment between bracket slot deformation and amount of torque in the five brands, a difference is found in the deformation in five brands except 3 M, Ormco, Biom and Shinye. There is a difference in the amount of torque between the five brands with torsional angle of 30 ° (except 3 M and Ormco) and 45 °. It is concluded that metal compositions and manufacturing process are the factors that influence the occurrence of deformation bracket slot {{and the amount of}} torque. Manufacturing process using MIM and metal compositions of AISI 303 and 17 - 4 PH reduce the risk of deformation...|$|E
40|$|I {{appreciate}} the authors for this informative and well-written article. The article presents a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} data, but I have some queries which are listed below. Q 1. Four types of ceramic brackets and a conven tional stainless steel brackets were tested in this study. However, the authors did not present a pre scription for each bracket. The sliding friction can be affected by torque at wirebracket interface. I wonder if a prescription of each bracket was identical in this study. Q 2. To measure coefficient of friction (COF), the authors used 0. 017 × 0. 025 inch (in) archwire for the 0. 018 in slot brackets and 0. 019 × 0. 025 in arch wire for the 0. 022 in slot brackets. Despite what was mentioned by the authors, plays due to lateral clearances between bracket slot walls and archwires were different in the 0. 018 in (about 4. 1 o) and 0. 022 in groups (about 9. 6 o) in this study. Why did not the authors choose 0. 016 × 0. 025 in archwire for the 0. 018 in slot brackets (about 4. 1 o) ? If {{there were no differences}} in the amount of play between two groups, significant differences of the COFs in two groups would not present. Q 3. The authors reported that the ceramic bracket with a 0. 022 in stainless steel slot showed the lowest mean COF, followed by the conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> with a 0. 022 in slot. I would like to know why the frictional resistance of a 0. 022 in ceramic bracket with a metal slot was lower than conventional metal bracket, even though it was not statistically significant. Is there a difference in the physical properties of the metal used in the two bracket slots...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the results}} {{obtained}} from the present in vitro study, a 1.5 -h immersion in the 0.2 % chlorhexidine mouthrinse {{did not have a}} significant influence on archwires’ surface roughness or the frictional resistance between <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> and the two types of orthodontic wires made of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and nickel-titanium alloys. Therefore, chlorhexidine-containing mouthrinses may be prescribed as non-destructive prophylactic agents on materials evaluated in this study for orthodontic patients.|$|R

[...] School of Dentistry. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 This {{study examined the}} effect of bracket manipulation in combination with delayed polymerization times on orthodontic bracket shear bond strength and degree of resin composite conversion. Orthodontics brackets were bonded to extracted third molars in a simulated oral environment after a set period of delayed polymerization time and bracket manipulation. After curing the bracket adhesive, each bracket underwent shear bond strength testing followed by micro-Raman spectroscopy analysis to measure the degree of conversion of the resin composite. Results demonstrated the shear bond strength {{and the degree of}} conversion of ceramic brackets did not vary over time. However, with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> there was a significant effect (p ≤ 0. 05) of delay time on shear bond strength between the 0. 5 min and 10 min bracket groups. In addition, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> showed significant differences related to degree of conversion over time between the 0. 5 min and 5 min groups, in addition to the 0. 5 min and 10 min groups. This investigation suggests that delaying bracket adhesive polymerization up to a period of 10 min then adjusting the orthodontic bracket may increase both shear bond strength and degree of conversion of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> while having no effect on ceramic brackets.

40|$|Friction is an {{integral}} part of fixed orthodontic treatment. Several innovations have been made to reduce friction and thereby get predictable and faster tooth movements. Self ligating brackets are one such innovation which is said to offer the possibility of a significant reduction in average treatment times and also in anchorage requirements. Ceramic Self ligating brackets introduce recently have the added advantage of aesthetics. This study was conducted to compare the frictional resistance of conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> metal insert ceramic, Self ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and Self ligating ceramic brackets against a common <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire. Fifteen premolar in each group (0. 022 Roth prescription) were tested against 0. 019 x 0. 025 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire using Lloyd universal testing machine. The conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> showed a frictional resistance of 66. 47 ± 7. 86 g metal insert ceramic brackets showed a frictional resistance of 77. 52 ± 8. 59 g. the Self ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> had a frictional resistance of 40. 21 ± 7. 76 g Self ligating ceramic brackets had a frictional resistance of 72. 67 ± 5. 76 g Self ligating ceramic brackets do have slightly lesser friction than metal insert ceramic brackets but significantly more than metal brackets...|$|R
