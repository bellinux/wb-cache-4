A Basic Law was established <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on 20 May. However, England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson wanted a four-week break {{before the start of}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> any England players were involved (Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch all later made his squad) would get a decent rest before the tournament. The final was scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium, however the stadium had fallen behind in its rebuild and would not be completed in time for the final. The final would instead be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where it had been held since 2001. Mike Dean was originally appointed to referee the final, but questions about his impartiality were raised as he resided close to Liverpool. He was replaced by Alan Wiley.|$|E
5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{the axis of}} the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that Angel {{has been}} cursed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he ever {{experiences}} pure happiness, he {{will once again}} lose his soul, Darla later returns and sleeps with him, but her plot fails; being with her only brings Angel despair, {{as well as providing}} him with a new understanding of his role as a champion. Their one-night stand leads to an unexpected development for the both of them: Darla reappears in season three, pregnant with Angel's child, despite the fact that vampires cannot normally conceive. Her pregnancy allows Darla to experience emotions that had previously been lost to her {{in the presence of the}} human soul of her unborn child. Admitting that creating life with Angel was the only good thing they ever did together, Darla makes sure Angel will relay that to their child before she stakes herself through the heart, sacrificing her life so their son, Connor, can be born. Darla turns to dust, but the baby remains. Darla later appears as a spirit, trying to persuade her son in an effort to save him from the renegade deity Jasmine's manipulations, as the latter's actions are bringing Connor into the same dark path both Darla and Angel had taken.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E
