40|$|Abstract. Although several generic process ontologies {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the past, the design of process ontologies for specific domains remains a challenge. Earlier work by Aameri that provided a methodology for specifying a domain pro-cess ontology requires a characterization of the partial automorphisms of the mod-els of an underlying <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> ontology. In this paper, we exploit the modular-ization of domain ontologies {{as a means for}} reusing the existing domain process ontologies through ontology combination and merging. The metatheoretic relation-ships among ontologies within a repository {{play a key role in}} the characterization of how a domain process ontology for a given <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> is related to the domain process ontologies based on the different modules of the <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> ontology...|$|E

However, different models are done by different people, which may use different terminology, which prevents relating the models. Therefore, we propose a framework consisting of process flow and value aspects and in addition a <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> model with structural and relational components. Further, we outline the usage of the <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> model to enable relating the different aspects...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} framework for generating thick domain wall {{solutions to the}} coupled Einstein-scalar field equations which are (locally) plane symmetric. This approach leads naturally to two broad classes of wall-like solutions. The two classes include all previously known thick domain walls. Although one of these classes is static and the other dynamic, the corresponding Einstein-scalar equations share the same mathematical structure independent of the assumption of any reflection symmetry. We also exhibit a class of thick <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> wall spacetimes with different asymptotic vacua. Our analyses of particle motion in such spacetimes raises the interesting possibility that <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> walls will possess a unique experimental signature.

40|$|Finding {{features}} that disentangle the different causes {{of variation in}} real data is a difficult task, that has nonetheless received considerable attention in <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> like natural images. Interactive environments, in which an agent can deliberately take actions, offer an opportunity to tackle this task better, because the agent can experiment with different actions and observe their effects. We introduce the idea that in interactive environments, latent factors that control the variation in observed data can be identified by figuring out what the agent can control. We propose a naive method to find factors that explain or measure {{the effect of the}} actions of a learner, and test it in illustrative experiments. Comment: RLDM submissio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic Bayesian {{networks}} (DBNs) extend Bayesian networks from <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> to dynamic domains. The {{only known}} generic method for exact inference in DBNs {{is based on}} dynamic expansion and reduction of active slices. It is effective when the domain evolves relatively slowly, but {{is reported to be}} “too expensive ” for fast evolving domain where inference is under time pressure. This study explores the stationary feature of problem domains to improve the efficiency of exact inference in DBNs. We propose the construction of a temporally invariant template of a DBN directly supporting exact inference and discuss issues in the construction. This method eliminates the need for the computation associated with dynamic expansion and reduction of the existing method. The method is demonstrated by experimental result...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a domain wall solution in $F(R) $ gravity. We re{{construct a}} <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> wall solution in a scalar field theory. We also reconstruct an explicit $F(R) $ gravity {{model in which}} a <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> wall solution can be realized. Moreover, we show that there could exist an effective (gravitational) domain wall {{in the framework of}} $F(R) $ gravity. In addition, it is demonstrated that a logarithmic non-minimal gravitational coupling of the electromagnetic theory in $F(R) $ gravity may produce time-variation of the fine structure constant which may increase with decrease of the curvature, and that this model would be ruled out by the constraints on the time variation of the fine structure constant from quasar absorption lines. We also present cosmological consequences of the coupling of the electromagnetic field to a scalar field as well as the scalar curvature and discuss the relation between variation of the fine structure constant and the breaking of the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field.

The division into sub domains depends mainly on the type of application. We classify the domains of speech recognition into four groups, dynamic <b>domains</b> and <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> depending on the vocabulary and the structure of that domain. The speech recognition problems for the sub-domains that fall into these 4 categories are solved independently to solve the problem of speech recognition for the whole domain. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Among precise {{abstract}} interpretation methods {{developed during the}} last decade, policy iterations {{is one of the}} most promising.

This prevents an easy integration in existing <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> through reduced product. This paper aims at providing a classic abstract domain interface to policy iterations. Usage of semidefinite programming to infer quadratic invariants on linear systems {{is one of the most}} appealing use of policy iteration. Combination with a template generation heuristic, inspired from existing methods from control theory, gives a fully automatic abstract domain to infer quadratic invariants on linear systems with guards. Those systems often constitute the core of embedded control systems and are hard, when not impossible, to analyze with linear abstract domains. The method has been implemented and applied to some benchmark systems, giving good results...|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic {{reasoning}} with multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) {{has been}} successfully applied in <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> under the cooperative multiagent paradigm. Probabilistic reasoning in dynamic domains under the same paradigm involves several issues. This paper proposes an approach to address these issues. Intuitively, observation on current state plays a more {{important role in the}} reasoning of the current state than remote historic information. Based on the intuition, we model the entire domain {{for a period of time}} into an MSBN and then reason about the state of the dynamic domain period by period exactly. In reasoning the state of a suspected entity, we compute and observe an observable Markov boundary of the entity. This makes observation more efficient and relevant. In MSBNs, an observable Markov boundary of a node may span across all Bayesian subnets. We present an algorithm for cooperative computation of an observable Markov boundary of a set of nodes in MSBNs without revealing subnet structures. Preliminary experiments show the approach works well on our simulated multiagent dynamic domains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Business Process Modeling is {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} digitalization of both IT and non-IT business processes, {{as well as for}} their deployment on service-oriented architectures. A number of methodologies, languages, and software tools have been proposed to support digital business process design; nonetheless, a lot remains to be done for assessing a business process model validity with respect to an existing organizational structure or external constraints like the ones imposed by security compliance regulations. In particular, web-based business coalitions and other inter-organizational transactions pose a number of research problems. The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) provides a framework for representing processes at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, a MDA-driven notion of business process model is introduced, composed of a <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> model including the domain entities and actors, plus a platform-independent workflow model providing a specification of process activities. The paper focuses on semantics-aware representation techniques, introducing logics-based <b>static</b> <b>domain</b> models and their relationship with Description Logics and current Semantic Web metadata formats. Then, the paper discusses some issues emerging from the literature on business processes representation and presents some research directions on the evaluation of the compatibility of business and IT processes with existing organizational environments and practices. The problem of implicit knowledge and of its capture in a manner which allows it to be included in business process design is also discussed, presenting some open research issues. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} lateral {{organization of}} lipid domains in vesicles versus supported membranes and monolayers. The lipid mixtures used are predominantly DOPC/DPPC/Chol and DOPC/BSM/Chol, {{which have been}} previously shown to produce coexisting liquid phases in vesicles and monolayers. In a monolayer at an air-water interface, these lipids have miscibility transition pressures of ∼ 12 – 15 mN/m, which can rise to 32 mN/m if the monolayer is exposed to air. Lipid monolayers can be transferred by Langmuir-Schäfer deposition onto either silanized glass or existing Langmuir-Blodgett supported monolayers. Micron-scale domains {{are present in the}} transferred lipids only if they were present in the original monolayer before deposition. This result is valid for transfers at 32 mN/m and also at lower pressures. Domains transferred to glass supports differ from liquid domains in vesicles because they are static, do not align in registration across leaflets, and do not reappear after temperature is cycled. Similar <b>static</b> <b>domains</b> are found for vesicles ruptured onto glass surfaces. Although supported membranes on glass capture some aspects of vesicles in equilibrium (e. g., gel-liquid transition temperatures and diffusion rates of individual lipids), the collective behavior of lipids in large liquid domains is poorly reproduced...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bisociations {{represent}} interesting {{relationships between}} seemingly unconnected concepts from {{two or more}} contexts. Most of the existing approaches that permit the discovery of bisociations from data rely {{on the assumption that}} contexts are static or considered as unchangeable domains. Actually, several real-world domains are intrin-sically dynamic and can change over time. The same domain can change and can become completely different from what/how it was before: a dynamic domain observed at different time-points can present different representations and can be reasonably assimilated to a series of distinct <b>static</b> <b>domains.</b> In this work, we investigate the task of linking concepts from a dynamic domain through the discovery of bisociations which link concepts over time. This provides us with a means to unearth linkages which have not been discovered when observing the <b>domain</b> as <b>static,</b> but which may have developed over time, when considering the dynamic nature. We propose a computational solution which, assuming a time interval-based discretization of the domain, explores the spaces of asso-ciation rules mined in the intervals and chains the rules {{on the basis of the}} concept generalization and information theory criteria. The application to the literature-based discovery shows how the method can re-discover known connections in biomedical terminology. Experiments and compar-isons using alternative techniques highlight the additional peculiarities of this work. ...|$|R
