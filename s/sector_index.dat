By utilizing cointegration analyses, this paper investigates the long-term relationships of İstanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) with the stock exchanges of developed USA, Germany, UK, Japan and developing India and Malaysia over the period of January 1986 -July 2006. The integration of ISE with main <b>sector</b> <b>indices</b> of countries are examined by dividing the 1986 - 2006 period into three sub-periods as well. The effects of financial liberalization in Turkey and global crises of 1998 - 1999 on the likely integation of ISE are investigated by examining the subperiods. In addition to the main indices of countries; industrial, financial and utılıty <b>sector</b> <b>indices</b> are included in the analyses in order to determine whether the integration differs among main <b>sector</b> <b>indices.</b> Italy, France and Spain are also included in the analyses based on main <b>sector</b> <b>indices.</b> The findings suggest that ISE has long term relationships with UK, USA, Germany and India main <b>sector</b> <b>indices</b> over the period of 1986 - 2006.

40|$|The paper {{examined}} the hedging effectiveness of optimal hedge ratios derived from four different models: ordinary least square model, a vector auto-regression, a vector error-correction model and a dynamic conditional correlation generalized {{autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity}} (DCC-GARCH) model. The hedged portfolio consisted of finance sector sub-index and finance <b>sector</b> <b>index</b> futures and electronics sector sub-index and electronics <b>sector</b> <b>index</b> futures. Daily observations covered the period 21 July 1999 - 31 December 2007. In both sectors for Taiwan <b>sector</b> <b>index</b> futures, hedge ratio derived from ordinary least square model provided greater risk reduction, whereas hedge ratio derived from DCC-GARCH model yielded higher utility.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} impact of Industrial Production Index to sector performance of Beverage, Food and Tobacco in Colombo Stock Exchange Sri Lanka. Secondary data {{were used for the}} analysis. <b>Sector</b> <b>index</b> was taken from the Data Library of Colombo Stock Exchange and Industrial Production Index was taken from Annual Reports of Central Bank Sri Lanka. Monthly data were gathered from January 2002 to December 2014. For the time series data set, first, the stationary was checked using Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips Perron Tests of E-views software. The results of stationary check show that the <b>sector</b> <b>index</b> is stationary at 1 st difference in both ADF and PP tests. Industrial Production Index is stationary at 2 nd difference in ADF test but 1 st difference is stationary in PP test. Because of the seasonal trend in IPI 12 th difference also considered and it is stationary in both ADF and PP tests. Granger Causality test was used to find out the causal relationship between variables. Results show the one way causality that the changes occurring in IPI will have an effect on changes in <b>sector</b> <b>index.</b> But changes in <b>sector</b> <b>index</b> will not have any effect on changes in IPI. Finally a regression was used to find out the relationship between variables. A Pearson Correlation coefficient was checked to find the correlation among variables before moving to the regression. Result of correlation test shows 84 % higher correlation between variables and regression result shows a significant positive relationship amongvariables. The study concludes that Industrial Production Index will positively impact on Beverage, Food and Tobacco <b>sector</b> <b>Index</b> in Sri Lanka. It can be recommended that the changes occurring in the IPI be considered by Investors when they buy and sell stocks in BFT sector...|$|E

Lagging period is varied from 1 day to 5 days to investigate if any selected sector has lagged influence over any other sectoral index movement. If any upward/downward movement of a sectoral index (sector A) is correlated with similar upward/downward movement of another sectoral index (Sector B) with a time lag of ‘d’ days, then with association rule mining support and confidence is calculated for the combination. If d is the lag for which support and confidence is maximum then depending on the higher correlation as well as higher support and confidence value {{it is possible to}} forecast future (d days ahead of current day) movement of sector B based on present day movement of sector A. This model first uses correlational analysis to identify the level of dependence among two different sectors, then considers only those sectors having higher value of correlation for association rule mining. Those sector are not considered for which combination correlation is very low or 0. This model has been tested with Indian share market data (NSE sectoral index data of 6 sectors) of 2015.
