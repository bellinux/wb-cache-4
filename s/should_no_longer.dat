5|$|Pascual Ruiz Huidobro stated that, {{since the}} {{authority}} that appointed Cisneros had expired, Cisneros <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{have a place}} in the government. Huidobro felt that the Cabildo should be in government, as it was the representative of the people. Melchor Fernández, Juan León Ferragut and Joaquín Grigera supported his vote, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{barbed wire}} which fenced us in {{did not cause}} us any real fear.... We {{appointed}} a Jewish Council, a Jewish police, an office for social assistance, a labor committee, a hygiene department–a whole government machinery. Everyone marveled at it. We <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. Our fear and anguish were at an end. We were living among Jews, among brothers...|$|E

In the episode, Mulder is shown {{evidence}} of alien life which may actually {{be part of a}} huge government hoax designed to deflect attention from secret military programs. Meanwhile, Scully struggles with her cancer in the face of hostility from her brother, who believes she <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be working.|$|E
5|$|For {{legal system}} reform, the Commission {{suggested}} {{the creation of}} county courts led by the Westminster judges with jurisdiction over civil actions, and small claims courts for amounts under £4 to be manned by commissioners, approved by Justices of the Peace. They also supported {{the creation of a}} Court of Appeal consisting of laymen chosen by Parliament, the formation of a land registry and a permanent law commission. Against Hale's wishes, the Commission called for the abolition of benefit of clergy, and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide. The Commission also suggested that debtors <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be imprisoned, and attorneys should be educated at an Inn of Court and not allowed to practise until they were admitted as members.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Blois {{had lost}} his legateship before Celestine became pope, {{but it was not}} until about 1150 that Theobald was {{appointed}} legate by Eugene III, perhaps owing to the exhortations of Bernard of Clairvaux. Theobald held the legatine powers in England until his death in 1161. In 1151 Theobald held a legatine council in London. The council was attended by the king and Eustace, the king's eldest son, as well as other members of the nobility. The council decreed eight canons, or ecclesiastical statutes, including ones condemning the pillaging of church properties and the imposition of financial levies on the clergy. Another canon of the council stated that bishops <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> pursue violators of church property in the royal courts, but should use ecclesiastical courts instead. The other canons dealt with procedural matters arising from excommunications for abusing church property.|$|E

5|$|Many {{improvements}} to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. In 1985, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act led {{to a reduction in}} capacity from 18,000 to 8,000. The Kop End was closed, and the Main Stand capacity was reduced by 3,000, because there were insufficient access points. £50,000 was spent on safety work to maintain a capacity of 8,000, and the club were unable to afford any further refurbishment. But the biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created– the Borough Road Stand, the Cowshed and the new Kop. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,587 of today.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they <b>should</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
