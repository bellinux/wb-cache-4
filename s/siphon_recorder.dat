5000|$|The syphon or <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder</b> is an {{obsolete}} {{electromechanical device}} {{used as a}} receiver for submarine telegraph cables invented by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in 1867. [...] It automatically records an incoming telegraph message as a wiggling ink line on a roll of paper tape. Later a trained telegrapher would read the tape, translating the pulses representing the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code to characters of the text message.|$|E
5000|$|... "Jenkin's {{position}} at Edinburgh {{led to a}} partnership in cable work with Varley and Thomson, whom he always admired. Jenkin's practical and businesslike abilities were of assistance to Thomson, relieving him of routine and sparing his time for other work. In 1870 the <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder</b> for tracing a cablegram in ink instead of merely flashing it by the moving ray of the mirror galvanometer, was introduced on long cables and became a source of profit to Jenkin and Varley {{as well as to}} Thomson, its inventor." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{indicating}} device {{such as an}} earphone, which converted the pulses of current into sound waves. The first receivers used an electric bell instead. Later receivers in commercial wireless systems used a Morse <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder,</b> which consisted of an ink pen mounted on a needle swung by an electromagnet (a galvanometer) which drew a line on a moving paper tape. Each string of damped waves constituting a Morse [...] "dot" [...] or [...] "dash" [...] caused the needle to swing over, creating a displacement of the line, which could be read off the tape. With such an automated receiver a radio operator didn't have to continuously monitor the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder</b> of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E
5000|$|His {{paper on}} his experiments: [...] "On the {{relation}} of metallic powders to electrical oscillations", was published 15 December 1895. He did not apply for a patent for his invention. [...] In July, 1895 he installed his receiver and a <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder</b> {{on the roof of}} the Institute of Forestry building in St. Petersburg. and was able to detect thunderstorms at a range of 50 km, however he was also aware of its communication potential. His paper, read at the 7 May 1895 meeting, concludedI can express my hope that my apparatus will be applied for signaling at great distances by electric vibrations of high frequency, as soon as there will be invented a more powerful generator of such vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder</b> {{works on}} the {{principle}} of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. [...] The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1841, Bain in {{conjunction}} with Lieutenant Thomas Wright RN, patented a method for using electricity to control railway engines by turning off steam, marking time, giving signals, and printing information at different locations. The most significant idea incorporated in the patent was his plan for inverting the needle telegraph earlier developed by Ampere, Wheatstone and others: instead of making signals by a pivoted magnetic needle {{under the influence of}} an electromagnet, he made them by suspending a movable coil between the poles of a fixed magnet. A similar concept appears in Sir William Thomson's <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder.</b> Bain also proposed to make the coil record messages by printing them, an idea he developed further in a subsequent patent. His telegraph was also successful abroad: [...] "The initial Austrian Bain instruments were made by Johann Michael Ekling in Vienna, and later by the k.k. Telegraphenwerkst√§tte Wein, the Imperial Royal Telegraph Workshops Vienna." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1853, Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{predicted}} as a resultof mathematical calculations {{the oscillatory}} {{nature of the}} electric discharge of a condenser circuit. To Henry, however, belongs the credit of discerning {{as a result of}} his experiments in 1842 the oscillatory nature of the Leyden jar discharge. He wrote: The phenomena require us to admit the existence of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several reflex actions backward and forward, each more feeble than the preceding, until the equilibrium is obtained. These oscillations were subsequently observed by B. W. Feddersen (1857) who using a rotating concave mirror projected an image of the electric spark upon a sensitive plate, thereby obtaining a photograph of the spark which plainly indicated the alternating nature of the discharge. Sir William Thomson was also the discoverer of the electric convection of heat (the [...] "Thomson" [...] effect). He designed for electrical measurements of precision his quadrant and absolute electrometers. The reflecting galvanometer and <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder,</b> as applied to submarine cable signaling, are also due to him.|$|E

5000|$|The first radio {{receivers}} invented by Marconi, Oliver Lodge and Alexander Popov in 1894-5 used a primitive radio wave detector called a coherer, invented in 1890 by Edouard Branly and improved by Lodge and Marconi. [...] The coherer was a glass tube with metal electrodes at each end, with loose metal powder between the electrodes. [...] It initially {{had a high}} resistance. When a radio frequency voltage {{was applied to the}} electrodes, its resistance dropped and it conducted electricity. In the receiver the coherer was connected directly between the antenna and ground. In addition to the antenna, the coherer was connected in a DC circuit with a battery and relay. When the incoming radio wave reduced the resistance of the coherer, the current from the battery flowed through it, turning on the relay to ring a bell or make a mark on a paper tape in a <b>siphon</b> <b>recorder.</b> In order to restore the coherer to its previous nonconducting state to receive the next pulse of radio waves, it had to be tapped mechanically to disturb the metal particles. [...] This was done by a [...] "decoherer", a clapper which struck the tube, operated by an electromagnet powered by the relay.|$|E
