500|$|I am {{ashamed to}} relate what Gallienus used often to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid {{the ills of}} mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, {{he is said to}} have exclaimed [...] "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" [...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E
500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the premiere was leaked onto the {{internet}} {{three weeks before the}} scheduled series premiere. This attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans, and caused interest in the show to skyrocket. The BBC released a statement that the source of the leak appears to be connected to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which responded by stating that they [...] "are looking into it. That's all I can <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point because we don't know exactly what happened. It certainly wasn't done intentionally." [...] Asa Bailey, founder of the Viral Advertising Association, said that the BBC hired them for viral marketing strategies, and that he told them [...] "they should release things before their time", to create a [...] "cool factor". Both the BBC and CBC denied any involvement, but Bailey believes that to be disingenuous, saying that it is [...] "the best viral advert they could have done". The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company.|$|E
500|$|With the Peace of Amiens, Cooke briefly retired on half-pay {{before being}} {{recalled}} to the fleet at {{the outbreak of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral Sir William Young at Plymouth, but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of [...] on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve escaped from Toulon, beginning the Trafalgar Campaign, Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. The squadron arrived off Cadiz on 9 June and Collingwood detached Bellerophon and three other ships to blockade Cartagena under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time that [...] "To be in a general engagement with Nelson would crown all my military ambition". Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} hours of the event, [...] the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast (the host country of ECOWAS) Daniel Kablan Duncan said that the [...] "information {{indicates}} to us that there is a coup underway. ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d'etat," [...] he added that [...] "it's sad that after the example of Senegal, where the elections finished so well, that we have, after Mali, a new forceful intervention in Guinea-Bissau. What I can <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment is that...the situation won't be accepted by ECOWAS." [...] ECOWAS Commission President Kadré Désiré Ouedraogo issued a statement that read: [...] "The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act, which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea-Bissau as a failed state." [...] ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security. The delegation, which would also include civilians, would be led by Guinean President Alpha Condé. ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead. ECOWAS constitutes a contact group, chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and Togo, to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis. ECOWAS also had a stanby force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force, as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations.|$|E
