Circumduction {{is a combination of}} flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. Circumduction can be best performed at ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by {{other parts of the body}} such as fingers, hands, feet, and head. For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a Ellipsoid joint is the wrist; it {{functions}} similarly to the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> except is unable to move 360 degrees.|$|R

5000|$|... {{synovial}} joint (also {{known as a}} diarthrosis) - freely movable. Synovial joints can in turn be classified into six groups according {{to the type of}} movement they allow: plane <b>joint,</b> ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint and saddle joint.|$|R

30|$|Especially in {{the most}} severe knee {{deformity}} with aplasia of the cruciate ligament <b>and</b> ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> configuration, the frontal plane instability can lead to recurrence of axial malalignment after deformity correction [13].|$|R
50|$|Shoulder {{arthritis}} {{can be one}} {{of three}} types of arthritis in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder. The glenohumeral joint is a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> which relies on cartilage to move smoothly and to operate normally.|$|R
50|$|Spigot <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the <b>socket.</b> Normal spigot <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained spigot <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R

5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> (<b>joint</b> replacement) <b>and</b> dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|R
50|$|Early {{underwater}} lights were fixed electric flood lamps or portable lamps with dry batteries {{for use by}} divers in standard diving dress.

50|$|The pack has two levers, rigidly {{connected}} to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint)</b> to fly sideways.|$|R
50|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (or glenohumeral joint from Greek glene, eyeball, + -oid, 'form of', + Latin humerus, shoulder) is structurally {{classified as a}} synovial ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> functionally as a diarthrosis and multiaxial joint. It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) {{and the head of}} the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|R
50|$|Spines are {{ossicles}} {{that project}} {{from the body}} wall and articulate with other ossicles through ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> mounted on tubercles. They are formed from crystals of calcite and can be solid or hollow, long or short, thick or thin and sharp or blunt. The spines serve a protective function and are also used for locomotion.|$|R
50|$|The intake ports are narrow {{enough to}} ensure that piston rings {{do not need to}} be pegged. Instead of using a gudgeon pin, each piston is {{connected}} to its connecting rod via a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> to enable the piston to rotate. This feature has been abandoned for the Gen-2 version in favour of conventional gudgeon pins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} {{the ends of the}} bonesâ€”Some joints {{normally}} have a large range of movement, such as the shoulder and hip. Both are ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b> If a shallow rather than a deep socket is inherited, a relatively large range of movement will be possible. If the socket is particularly shallow, then the joint may dislocate easily.|$|R
40|$|Building {{automobile}} {{bodies from}} lightweight materials using space-frame construction techniques is increasingly popular because of exhaust emission legislation. One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the butt-jointed end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of neoprene O-ring seals for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint inlet (gate) was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|R

50|$|The ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> (or {{spheroidal}} joint) {{is a type}} of {{synovial joint}} in which the ball-shaped surface of one rounded bone fits into the cup-like depression of another bone. The distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes, which have one common center. It enables the bone to move in many places (nearly all directions).|$|R

50|$|By 28 February 1815 Stephenson {{had made}} enough {{improvements}} {{to file a}} patent with the overseer of the colliery, Ralph Dodds. This specified direct communication between cylinder and wheels using a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> The drive wheels were connected by chains, which were abandoned {{after a few years}} in favour of direct connections. A new locomotive constructed on these principles was put into operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{joints between}} bones allow movement, some {{allowing}} {{a wider range}} of movement than others, e.g. the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck. Movement is powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones, and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{components}} subjected to contact stress as local compressive stress {{is important in}} engineering application especially in ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> Joining. Two kinds of contact stress are introduced in the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> the first is from normal contact while the other is from sliding contact. Although joining two long links (drive shaft in steering cars) will cause the effect of flexural and tensional buckling stress in hollow columns through the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> ends on the failure condition of the joining mechanism. In this paper the consideration of the combined effect of buckling Load and contact stress on the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> have been taken, epically on the stress distribution in the contact area. Different parameters have been taken {{in the design of}} joint. This is done by changing the angles for applied loads with the principle axis, the angle of contact between ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>and</b> using different applied loads. The problem has been solved using analytical solution for computing the critical loads and using these loads for calculating the stress distribution with finite element method using ANSYS 10. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental method using photo elasticity pattern which shows good agreement between experimental and simulation results...|$|R
