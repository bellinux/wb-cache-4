5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
25|$|As an {{abrasive}} garnet can be broadly {{divided in}} two categories; blasting grade and water jet grade. The garnet, {{as it is}} mined and collected, is crushed to finer grains; all pieces which are larger than 60mesh (250micrometers) are normally used for <b>sand</b> <b>blasting.</b> The pieces between 60mesh (250micrometers) and 200mesh (74micrometers) are normally used for water jet cutting. The remaining garnet pieces that are finer than 200mesh (74micrometers) are used for glass polishing and lapping. Regardless of the application, the larger grain sizes are used for faster work and the smaller ones are used for finer finishes.|$|E
25|$|Already in his patent {{application}} of 1886 Pollak {{wrote that the}} capacitance of the capacitor increased if {{the surface of the}} anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for roughening the anode surface, mechanical methods like <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> or scratching, and chemical etching with acids and acid salts forced by high currents. Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Progress relating to the etching process is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.|$|E

The parameters of ingots obtained by two-temperature synthesis in <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> boats, BN coated boats and boats with surface crystallites have been compared. The results indicate that synthesis in boats with crystalline coating leads to residual impuri-ties reduction — for instance the concentration of Si at the front {{and at the end}} of such boats are respectively 3. 4 × 1015 cm− 3 and 2. 1 × 1015 cm− 3, while for <b>sand</b> <b>blasted</b> boat they are 8. 1 × 1015 cm− 3 and 2. 7 × 1015 cm− 3.
