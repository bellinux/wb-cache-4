40|$|In {{the past}} few decades global health has {{improved}} significantly and many countries have started to move away from high mortality rates due to infectious diseases. This trend has however been accompanied by an increase in chronic disease incidence, in particular Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). In countries that are making this epidemiological transition, such as India, chronic diseases are also a hindrance to economic health as a large portion of deaths occur when people are still active in the work force. There are various policies that may be implemented to curb the burden of CVDs. These include population based approaches and high risk management strategies. In this thesis, the design of a mobile CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> to aid the screening of high risk subjects by low-skilled health workers is described. Focusing on India, a fertile ground where a mobile tool-kit may be implemented was identified at the intersection of: 1. Strong health worker schemes in primary care, 2. The diffusion of mobile phone technology and 3. Well developed CVD risk management strategies. The tools that constitute this CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> were tested at Sengupta Hospital and Research Institute, Nagpur, India. These tests showed that there is potential to develop the CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> further into a commercial product. The main advantage of the CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> developed is that, differently from standard CVD risk factor analysis, it measures the root issue of many CVDs, i. e. arterial stiffness. Therefore, the CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> brings complex clinical analysis capabilities, that are generally only available in equipped hospitals, to the hands of low-skilled health workers working in primary care centers. Although the CVD <b>Screening</b> <b>Kit</b> is still at an early stage of development, how it may be implemented in current public and private health programs that tackle CVDs, is also analysed in this thesis. Furthermore, it is discussed that introducing mobile phones to healthworkers, who are mostly female, may have a slow but strong impact on the independence and leadership of women. by Niccoló Pasquale Luigi Maria Pignatelli.

Initial results showed an 82 % agreement between the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and cultural methods when using the criterion recommended by the manufacturer as a cut-off for all types of foods. By adjusting the cut-off for each type of food, the number of EIA positive, culture negative samples was reduced although the number of EIA negative, culture positive samples increased. The EIA may be more sensitive than the cultural methods as in many cases the EIA positive, culture negative results could be real positives which were not detected by the cultural methods.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} two enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for {{detection of}} antinuclear antibodies (ANA) which became recently available {{and which were}} designed for application on a fully automated system; (i) the EIA-ANA <b>screen</b> <b>kit</b> from Sigma Diagnostics (St. Louis, MO, USA) applied on APTUS, an automated EIA analyser from Sigma Diagnostics and (ii) the Cobas Core Hep- 2 EIA-ANA assay applied on the fully automated Cobas Core immunochemistry analyzer from Roche Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland). The evaluation was done by an analytic comparison of the automated systems to an established indirect immunofluorescence (IF) method performed on SSA transfected human epitheloid cell substrate slides. Three hundred and thirty six samples were tested with the Sigma EIA-ANA assay and 603 samples with the Cobas Core Hep- 2 EIA-ANA assay. For both EIA systems, there was a trend of generally increasing signal from the assay system with increasing IF-ANA titers. With an IF-ANA reference range of < 1 : 160, concordance between Sigma EIA-ANA and IF-ANA was 86 % and concordance between Roche EIA-ANA and IF-ANA was 85 %. When compared to IF-ANA with a reference range of < 1 : 160, sensitivity and specificity of the EIA-ANA screen was 0. 65 and 0. 92, respectively, for Sigma EIA-ANA and 0. 61 and 0. 91, respectively, for the Cobas Core assay. The low sensitivity observed with both methods is a major concern. Sigma EIA-ANA screen revealed the presence of autoantibodies in 23 of the 29 samples containing antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and/or double stranded DNA and the Cobas Core Hep- 2 EIA-ANA assay revealed the presence of autoantibodies in 40 of the 43 samples containing antibodies to ENA and/or double stranded DNA. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus snakes {{presents}} various substances, {{including a}} serine protease with thrombin-like activity, called gyroxin, that clots plasmatic fibrinogen {{and promote the}} fibrin formation. The {{aim of this study}} was to purify and structurally characterize the gyroxin enzyme from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom. For isolation and purification, the following methods were employed: gel filtration on Sephadex G 75 column and affinity chromatography on benzamidine Sepharose 6 B; 12 % SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions; N-terminal sequence analysis; cDNA cloning and expression through RT-PCR and crystallization tests. Theoretical molecular modeling was performed using bioinformatics tools based on comparative analysis of other serine proteases deposited in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database. Protein N-terminal sequencing produced a single chain with a molecular mass of similar to 30 kDa while its full-length cDNA had 714 bp which encoded a mature protein containing 238 amino acids. Crystals were obtained from the solutions 2 and 5 of the Crystal <b>Screen</b> <b>Kit</b> (R), two and one respectively, that reveal the protein constitution of the sample. For multiple sequence alignments of gyroxin-like B 2. 1 with six other serine proteases obtained from snake venoms (SVSPs), the preservation of cysteine residues and their main structural elements (alpha-helices, beta-barrel and loops) was indicated. The localization of the catalytic triad in His 57, Asp 102 and Ser 198 as well as S 1 and S 2 specific activity sites in Thr 193 and Gli 215 amino acids was pointed. The area of recognition and cleavage of fibrinogen in SVSPs for modeling gyroxin B 2. 1 sequence was located at Arg 60, Arg 72, Gln 75, Arg 81, Arg 82, Lis 85, Glu 86 and Lis 87 residues. Theoretical modeling of gyroxin fraction generated a classical structure consisting of two alpha-helices, two beta-barrel structures, five disulfide bridges and loops in positions 37, 60, 70, 99, 148, 174 and 218. These results provided information about the functional structure of gyroxin allowing its application in the design of new drugs...|$|E

40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the UK. Screening is key to early detection. The Scottish {{programme}} of colorectal cancer screening is running successfully, and involves all adults aged between 50 and 74 years being invited to post back a faecal sample for testing every 2 years. However, screening uptake is sub-optimal: for example rates for the period November 2009 to October 2011 ranged from just 39 % for males living in the most deprived areas to 67 % for least deprived females. Recent {{research has shown that}} asking people to consider the emotional consequences of not participating in screening (anticipated regret) can lead to a significant increase in screening uptake. Methods/Design: We will test a simple anticipated regret manipulation, in a large randomised controlled trial with 60, 000 members of the general public. They will be randomly allocated to one of 3 arms, no questionnaire, control questionnaire or anticipated regret questionnaire. The primary outcome will be <b>screening</b> test <b>kit</b> return. Results will also be examined by demographic variables (age, gender, deprivation) as these are currently related to <b>screening</b> <b>kit</b> return. Discussion: If this anticipated regret intervention leads to a significant increase in colorectal cancer <b>screening</b> <b>kit</b> returns, this would represent a rare example of a theoretically-driven, simple intervention that could result in earlier detection of colorectal cancer and many more lives saved.
