40|$|The general mindset of most vendors {{is that if}} {{they have}} a valid tax invoice, they can claim all their input VAT. They are, however, not aware of the {{requirements}} of section 17 (1) of the Value-Added Tax Act. Section 17 (1) explains that vendors cannot claim all their input tax if their expense relates to both taxable and non-taxable supplies and that, consequently, input tax need to be apportioned in some or other way. There are several methods <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> available to vendors of which the turnover-based method is the only approved method by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) for which no ruling is necessary. This study investigates the most common methods used by vendors, how these methods function and also under which circumstances these methods are recommended. The sectors that are influenced the most by this provision in the Value-Added Tax Act are banks, universities and municipalities. These sectors have large amounts of exempt supplies but also taxable supplies with expenses incurred that cannot be allocated specifically to a certain income. Therefore, a method <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> should be used to allocate the input VAT. Information was obtained through financial reports and questionnaires from 29 entities in South Africa. The information was used to calculate an average percentage <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> in each sector and also to establish which method <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> is the most commonly used method <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> in each sector. The conclusion was drawn that there might, under certain circumstances, be uncertainty on whether some income should be included or excluded in the apportionment calculation. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that a ruling should be obtained from SARS to avoid problems in the future. CopyrightDissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|In the {{comparative}} political economy literature, recent work {{has focused on}} the exogenous determinants of the initial institutions that nations or colonies adopted in order to test the effects of institutions on growth. In this literature, the US is usually used as one case, and one in which initial democratic institutions have been linked as a reason for the current high levels of per capita income enjoyed by Americans. Yet, using the US states as a comparative dataset allows for the examination of the effect of institutions on development more systematically while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity (e. g. cultural differences, colonial heritage, religion). I develop a simple model using two time-invariant exogenous factors that explain the initial basis <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> adopted by each state. Since the sources of each state’s particular rules <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> are exogenous, we have more confidence that the empirical effects captured are those of institutions and not an omitted variable.

5000|$|As {{construed}} by the Supreme Court in the Brushaber case, {{the power}} of Congress to tax income derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, of the original Constitution {{rather than from the}} Sixteenth Amendment; the latter simply eliminated the requirement that an income tax, {{to the extent that it}} is a direct tax, must be apportioned among the states. A corollary of this conclusion is that any direct tax that is not imposed on [...] "income" [...] remains subject to the rule <b>of</b> <b>apportionment.</b> Because the Sixteenth Amendment does not purport to define the term [...] "direct tax," [...] the scope of that constitutional phrase remains as debatable as it was before 1913; but the practical significance of the issue was greatly reduced once income taxes, even if direct, were relieved from the requirement <b>of</b> <b>apportionment.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} focusses on the {{value-added tax}} apportionment methodology {{applied in the}} higher education sector of South Africa. The current apportionment method applied by universities is the varied input-based method. The research question that is posed, is whether the varied input-based method is effective and appropriate in the higher education sector in a South African context {{and whether or not}} there are other solutions which could apply to alleviate the burden that apportionment has placed on the universities. In addressing the research question the dissertation specifically discusses the principles <b>of</b> <b>apportionment,</b> turnover-based method, input-based method and varied input-based method. Furthermore, the dynamics of the higher education sector is discussed in detail with specific focus on the income streams and expense types of universities and how this influences the application <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> methods. Lastly, other solutions are considered such as a reduced Value-Added Tax rate for the supply of educational services and the zero-rating of the supply of educational services. It is concluded that the varied input-based method is definitely not the long term solution as the difficulty in its application and the financial burden makes it impracticable to use. Also, it is concluded that a possible solution is to zero-rate the supply of educational services by universities in terms of section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991. This would not only alleviate the burden <b>of</b> <b>apportionment,</b> but also result in universities being allowed to claim all the VAT it incurs (except for input tax denied in terms of section 17 (2) of the Value- Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991) and result in a net gain for the universities. Whatever is decided, the current investigation <b>of</b> <b>apportionment</b> methodology applied in the higher education sector of South Africa needs to be concluded as soon as possible and a clear practical and sustainable approach needs to be agreed upon, {{as it is in the}} best interest of all of the parties involved as well as South Africa and the education of its people as a whole...|$|R
