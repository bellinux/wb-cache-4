The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydropneumatic recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> <b>draft,</b> and another with solid rubber tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles.|$|R

This is the prerequisite for understanding since when the bringing into action of <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> wheels and charts made sense. The archaeobiological investigations from the Neolithic lake shore settlements at the Lake Zürich (town of Zürich) gave sensible indications that this was the case at the transition from the early to the late Late Neolithic period (Jung- / Spätneolithikum), from the Pfyn to the Horgen culture. From the Horgen culture onwards, there is an augmentation of settlements and there are also signs for a sensible opening of the landscape. In addition, we can suppose a diversification of the economy. Therefore, from the Horgen culture onwards a use of <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and charts makes sense...|$|R

30|$|However, {{many cities}} are not well-suited to year-round bike transport. For those cities, walking {{or use of}} carts, and use of animals such as horses and donkeys will {{probably}} begin to replace vehicle transport in some areas. Animals such as horses and oxen will also increasingly be used for harvesting and transporting food, as in the hinterlands of most cities {{before the advent of}} fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Some small farms in the USA and elsewhere are already increasingly using <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> rather than tractors because of the costs of fuel [81] and there are ethno-religious populations such as the Amish in some rural areas in the USA which still rely primarily on horses and oxen. This of course raises the issue of the land needed to produce fodder <b>for</b> these <b>animals.</b> <b>For</b> the USA prior to the widespread use of tractors and harvesters, {{it has been estimated that}} in 1915, about 93 million acres of farmland in the USA was devoted to producing feed (mainly oats) for horses and mules [2].

40|$|More than 85 % of {{communal}} area farmers in Zimbabwe use <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power <b>for</b> tillage and transport.

Research and development efforts on <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power technology are negligible when compared with work on beef and dairy cattle. A lot of work has also been done on implements, but without much consideration of the <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> used on smallholder farms.

Other challenges facing <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power development in Zimbabwe include the non-existence of appropriate on-farm feeding strategies, poor health management (particularly for donkeys), assessing the impact of training programmes for rural artisans, and development of affordable harnesses for donkeys. Appropriate farmer participatory approaches (including gender analysis) {{should be used in}} all efforts aiming to meet these challenges. For there to be sustainable development of <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power in Zimbabwe, educational curricula should be revised and tailored to promote animal power instead of tractor power.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} three ex-ante studies, from Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia, that examined the potential for adoption of agroforestry technologies should they be extended to farmers. Ethnographic linear programme modelling of households in all three locations shows that the potential adoption of these technologies depends on household composition, farm size, and availability of draft power. Results show that {{both male and female}} headed households can adopt the technology. A seed selling incentive enhanced adoption through augmenting household income and benefited farmers by increasing funds available for discretionary use. In Zimbabwe there was a greater increase in discretionary cash <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> owners than non-owners. It is concluded that in Southern Africa, improved fallows are a viable alternative to chemical fertilizer use for small farmers...|$|R

He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area <b>for</b> horses, <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1978, {{as part of}} the Four Modernizations campaign, the Family Production Responsibility System was created, {{dismantling}} communes {{and giving}} agricultural production responsibility back to individual households. Households are now given crop quotas that they were required to provide to their collective unit in return <b>for</b> tools, <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> seeds, and other essentials. Households, which now lease land from their collectives, are free to use their farmland however they see fit as long as they meet these quotas. This freedom has given more power to individual families to meet their individual needs. In addition to these structural changes, the Chinese government also engages in irrigation projects (such as the Three Gorges Dam), runs large state farms, and encourages mechanization and fertilizer use.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} discuss the first steps in {{a case study of}} present-day use, {{processing}} and storage of cereals and pulses, as well as several other plants used <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> in NW Tunisia. Data has been recorded using images and video filming, interviews and plant collection. Cereals, pulses, and other fodder plants are part of domestic production that was processed with the animal-drawn threshing sledge. This case study was primarily undertaken to better understand how present-day human food and fodder use is related to this particular technology, and to examine the variability in plants and processing techniques today. We found that non-mechanised threshing, but also harvesting of wild and domestic kinds of green fodder, are still geared to producing specific products <b>for</b> feeding <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and cows kept by farmers, who attribute particular importance to the superior qualities of various plants as fodder, for taste and quality of milk.

Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.|$|R

Seven interrelated subthemes were selected to allow contributors and discussion groups to focus on particular research and development topics: - Improving the profitability of animal traction; - Improving <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> management; - Improving tillage and weeding technology; - Improving implement supply/distribution - Women and animal traction technology; and - Improving animal powered transport; The workshop highlighted the great importance of animal traction as a major element in the smallholder farming systems of the region The use of <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> is expanding in most countries and in some areas almost all smallholder farmers now use <b>animal</b> <b>draft</b> power. Cows are increasingly used for work and research and extension workers should give more attention to this farmer-led process, likewise {{to the role of}} donkeys for cultivation and transport. The lack of accessiblity of animal traction technology to women was another issue raised by the workshop. It was recommended that promotion schemes should ensure that women benefit directly.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a two-wheel driven hitch-cart designed <b>for</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> power has been assessed. The cart fits a three-point linkage system and a ground-driven power take-off (PTO). Conventional pneumatic tires and metallic wheels have been tested in dedicated draft trials with increasing torque applied to PTO (7. 0 to 70 Nm) at two ballast levels (100 and 200 kg). Draft force varies from a minimum of about 760 N (pneumatic tires and the lowest ballast), up to about 4480 N (metallic wheels and the highest ballast), with a linear increase {{as a function of}} the PTO applied torque. In term of global efficiency the better performances was achieved in different conditions. The metallic wheels deliver greater power to the PTO than pneumatic tires. Furthermore, they had global efficiencies higher than pneumatic for high power requirements, while the pneumatics perform better when the required power is low. Slippage rises as a function of increasing torque and decreasing ballast, with metallic wheels allowing delivery of greater PTO torque at the same slippage extent. The performances of the cart are consistent with the use of implements designed for small tractors...|$|R
