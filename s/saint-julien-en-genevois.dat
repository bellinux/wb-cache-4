5|$|The ship {{dropped the}} torch off in Bari at 12:30pm on 19 July. It was run north through several Italian cities before {{crossing}} the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From {{there it was}} run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois.</b> The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey. That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as {{the pressure of the}} crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, Marchand {{commanded}} the 39th Division. General-major Stockhorn's brigade consisted of {{troops from the}} Grand Duchy of Baden, 2 battalions each of the Stockhorn Infantry Regiment Nr. 1 and the Crown Prince Infantry Regiment Nr. 3, and a Baden foot artillery battery. General-major Prince Emil's brigade {{was made up of}} soldiers from the Grand Duchy of Hesse, 2 battalions each of the Foot Guard, Life Guard, and 2nd Infantry Regiments, and a Hessian foot artillery battery. Marchand was present with Ney's III Corps at the battles of Lützen and Bautzen. He led his troops in Marshal Jacques MacDonald's XI Corps at the Battle of Leipzig. After his Germans abandoned the French alliance, he was responsible for defending the Department of Isère in the 1814 campaign. While commanding 11,000 troops at <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois</b> on 1 March 1814, he was defeated by Johann Nepomuk Joseph von Klebelsberg and a 6,000-man Austrian division. His forces lost 1,000 killed and wounded plus five guns and 300 men captured, while his opponents suffered 650 casualties.|$|E

500|$|The fraternal {{organisation}} {{was founded}} {{in the town of}} Annemasse, Haute-Savoie in eastern France in 1956. The 1901 French law of Associations required that the Priory of Sion be registered with the government; although the statutes and the registration documents are dated 7 May 1956, the registration took place at the subprefecture of <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois</b> on 25 June 1956 and this was announced in the Journal Officiel de la République Française on 20 July 1956. The Headquarters of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were based in the apartment of Plantard, in a social housing block known as Sous-Cassan newly constructed in 1956. The founders and signatories inscribed with their real names and aliases were Pierre Plantard, also known as [...] "Chyren", and André Bonhomme, also known as [...] "Stanis Bellas". Bonhomme was the President while Plantard was the Secretary General. [...] The registration documents also included the names of Jean Deleaval as the Vice-President and Armand Defago as the Treasurer. The offices of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were located at Plantard's apartment. The choice of the name [...] "Sion" [...] was based on a popular local feature, a hill south of Annemasse in France, known as Mont Sion, where the founders intended to establish a retreat center. The accompanying title to the name was [...] "Chevalerie d'Institutions et Règles Catholiques d'Union Indépendante et Traditionaliste": this subtitle forms the acronym CIRCUIT and translates in English as Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of Independent and Traditionalist Union".|$|E

2500|$|Klebelsberg {{controlled}} 5,600 men in 10 battalions {{and eight}} squadrons, supported by 29 guns. Assured by Bubna {{that he would}} be sent reinforcements through Switzerland, Klebelsberg arranged his defenses. He deployed Zechmeister on his left at Archamps and Klopstein on his right at <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois</b> and Bardonnex. Marchand ordered Serrant to move in the shadow of Mont Salève to outflank Zechmeister. The French general sent Dessaix to attack Klopstein's right flank at the hamlets of Tairier (Thairy) and Turens (Thérens). Marchand would personally direct the center attack directly against Saint-Julien. On 1 March 1814 at 8:00 am, Serrant began pressing back the Warasdiner Kreuzer Grenz Infantry from Le Petit Châble into its main defense line at La Place near Archamps. Two hours later, Dessaix's brigade in three columns drove the Austrians from Viry, Présilly and Songy. A half-battalion of the Wenzel Colloredo Infantry Regiment held up the French advance until being outflanked by one of Dessaix's columns moving from Songy.|$|E

The group was devoted to the support of building low-cost housing in Annemasse, and criticising local government through its journal Circuit.

50|$|Charles Pont {{was born}} in <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois,</b> France, on 6 January 1898 to a Swiss mother and an unknown father.

50|$|Born in the 20 April 1776 in {{the town}} of <b>Saint-Julien-en-Genevois,</b> then a part of Piedmont, Pacthod joined the King's Life Guards but France soon {{occupied}} his country and the French-speaking Pacthod rallied to the ideas of the French Revolution. He was elected lieutenant-colonel by the volunteers of the Mont-Blanc department and then sent to serve in the Siege of Toulon, where he was wounded seven times. He was deputy to the Chief of Staff of the French expeditionary force destined to Corsica and then, in January 1795, appointed to the military command of Marseille. He was holding this command when the family of General Napoleon Bonaparte, which had fled their native Corsica during the British occupation of the island, took refuge in the city. The Bonapartes had fled Corsica in order to escape possible retaliation from the British occupants and arrived destitute in Marseille. It seems that Pacthod showed little generosity towards the Bonapartes, a behaviour which Napoleon would never forgive. His career did advance quickly during the following years, seeing promotion to Brigadier General in May 1795, and was noted for his actions at the Battle of Alkmaar and Battle of Castricum.|$|E
