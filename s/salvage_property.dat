In January 1840, it ordered that the Africans be returned to their homeland by the U.S. government, and that one-third of La Amistad and its cargo be given to Lieutenant Gedney as <b>salvage</b> <b>property.</b> (The federal government had outlawed the slave trade between the U.S. and other countries in 1808; an 1818 law, as amended in 1819, provided for the return of all illegally traded slaves.) The captain's personal slave Antonio was declared the rightful property of the captain's heirs and was ordered restored to Cuba (Sterne said that he willingly returned to Cuba.)

2500|$|Asked [...] "How {{will you}} help with the housing and {{foreclosure}} problems in the U.S.?", Romney responded {{that it would be}} best not to try and stop the foreclosure process, to let it run its course and hit the bottom, and that he might be open to some government action to encourage refinancing. He also referred to the Obama administration as having [...] "slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang", and that the credit that was given to first-time home buyers was inadequate to turn around the housing market. He nevertheless is open to some government intervention but demands that it make sense from a business standpoint. Should the foreclosure process run its course, Romney sees recovery for the market as investors are allowed to <b>salvage</b> <b>property</b> values and move people back into their homes as renters, with the possibility to buy when they are fiscally prepared.|$|E

5000|$|Salvage Corps {{came into}} {{existence}} in the 19th century. With the growth of cities, fires and insurance, underwriters in several cities established fire fighting services to reduce losses.

50|$|There were 45 {{survivors}} from {{a crew of}} 86. On {{the morning}} after the wreck, the winds receded, and at low tide the wreck was in just six feet of water. Both the survivors and the local people attempted to <b>salvage</b> <b>property</b> from the wreck. King John III of Portugal, demanded the return of the cargo, and King Henry VIII set up a Court of Star Chamber. Some of the evidence that was given at the court survives, but not the outcome. However manorial rights of the time would have included an assumed right to goods from wrecks on manorial lands and three prominent landowners were able to improve their status and their manors in the years that followed. William Godolphin was knighted and Godolphin house was considerably improved. St Aubyn of St Michael's Mount was a Justice of the Peace. John Milliton of Pengersick Castle became High Sheriff of Cornwall and Pengersick Castle was also improved around this time. There is some evidence that Henry VIII ordered that the salvaged cargo should be returned to Portugal, but much of it was missing.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, in pure salvage (also called [...] "merit salvage"), {{there is}} no {{contract}} between {{the owner of the}} goods and the salvor. The relationship is one which is implied by law. The salvor of <b>property</b> under pure <b>salvage</b> must bring his claim for salvage in a court which has jurisdiction, and this will award salvage based upon the [...] "merit" [...] of the service and the value of the <b>salvaged</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|In both {{high-order}} and low-order {{salvage the}} amount of the salvage award is based first upon the value of the property saved. If nothing is saved, or if additional damage is done, there will be no award. The other factors to be considered are the skills of the salvor, the peril to which the <b>salvaged</b> <b>property</b> was exposed, the value of the property which was risked in effecting the salvage, {{the amount of}} time and money expended in the salvage operation etc.|$|R
50|$|The WPA workers led {{the cleanup}} of the city. The Evansville Merchants Retail Bureau took out {{newspaper}} ads to praise their work:Before and during the flood these men of WPA were active in <b>salvaging</b> <b>property</b> and saving lives, and immediately afterward they handled the cleanup job with such efficiency that many visitors were amazed that there was practically no evidence of the flood left throughout our entire city. All honor and gratitude {{is due to the}} rank and file of the WPA for their often almost super-human efforts, always giving their best in the interest of humanity.|$|R
50|$|The Convention {{does not}} {{consider}} saving lives {{to be part of}} salvage, but the protection of the environment is part of salvage. Oil pollution can cause damage to the environment. If the salvor prevents oil pollution from happening, he indeed performs a valuable service to the community as mentioned by (1997) 1 Lloyd's Rep 323 (HL), pp 326-28. Therefore, the salvor will be rewarded with special compensation, i.e., liability <b>salvage</b> instead of <b>property</b> <b>salvage.</b>|$|R

Earning the creatures' friendship, Diane catches glimpses of Eldona destroying Chris's BMW 733i.|$|R
2500|$|Pure salvage {{claims are}} divided into [...] "{{high-order}}" [...] and [...] "low-order" [...] salvage. In high-order salvage, the salvor exposes himself and his crew {{to the risk of}} injury and loss or damage to his equipment in order to <b>salvage</b> the <b>property</b> that is in peril. Examples of high-order salvage are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship, plane, or other sunken property, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order salvage occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order salvage include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order salvage receive substantially greater salvage award than those performing low order salvage.|$|R
5000|$|After {{secularization}} of {{the missions}} in 1834, Juan Alvarado, the Mexican Governor of California, granted {{the lands of}} the 8926 acre Rancho San Pedro to Francisco Sanchez in 1839. Included were the all of the buildings of the Asistencia. Sanchez retained ownership of the property after California was ceded to the United States in 1848. In 1894, roof tiles were <b>salvaged</b> from the <b>property</b> and installed on the Southern Pacific Railroad depot located in Burlingame, California (the first permanent structure constructed in the Mission Revival Style). Today, little remains of the original installation.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{that would be}} {{considered}} by a court in establishing {{the amount of the}} salvorâs award. Some of these include the difficulty of the operation, the risk involved to the salvor, the value of the property saved, the degree of danger to which the property was exposed, and the potential environmental impacts. It would be a rare case in which the salvage award would be greater than 50 percent {{of the value of the}} <b>property</b> <b>salvaged.</b> More commonly, salvage awards amount to 10 percent to 25 percent of the value of the property.|$|R
50|$|For {{individuals}} who are relocating overseas international transport insurance is usually a valuable plan. These plans are extremely broad in their scope and if the items insured are being shipped to their destination then the policy will usually be subject to marine insurance and maritime law. This includes all principals of average, salvage (different from the <b>salvage</b> found in <b>property</b> and auto insurance), and sue and tort. International transport insurance can be complicated as {{there are many different}} areas of consideration, typically an insurance company that deals with this area of insurance will have dedicated international transport specialists.|$|R

5000|$|While the Eleutheran Adventurers were {{primarily}} farmers, seamen from Bermuda began settling on New Providence in the 1660s, attracted by ambergris, wrecks and salt. There were vessels dedicated to wrecking from this time, but wrecking was a secondary occupation for most men. These seamen, who called themselves [...] "wrackers" [...] or [...] "wreckers", pursued wrecking aggressively, regarding all <b>salvage</b> as their <b>property.</b> They were {{rumored to have}} killed people who had inconveniently survived a shipwreck. They drove Spanish salvors away from Spanish wrecks, and even took goods that the Spanish had already salvaged. Spain regarded the Bahamian wreckers as pirates, and retaliated by attacking the wreckers' ships, kidnapping farmers from New Providence, and burning the capital, Charles Town.|$|R
5000|$|Construction on {{the dock}} was {{completed}} in 1866 and the unit was utilized as a repair dock for large vessels until its closure in 2005, when the lease held by Stevens Technical Services expired. Prior to its closure, ownership of the dock had been transferred from the initial owners, the Todd Shipyards, to Vigor after the merger of several shipyard companies. Shortly {{around the time of}} the lease's expiration, IKEA expressed their intent to purchase the property and turn it into a parking lot. Conservationists argued against the purchase, stating that the dock had been created at the end of the American Civil War and would be considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006 a comptroller for the city also noted that paving over the dock would be [...] "premature". Efforts to <b>salvage</b> the <b>property</b> included protests and a lawsuit against the United States Army. These efforts were unsuccessful and the graving dock was filled in to create a parking lot. The move was met with more criticism after 2008 reports stated that New York was in need of seven graving docks similar to the Red Hook graving dock.|$|R
5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the <b>salvage</b> to Boycott's <b>property.</b> In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed Â£500 in damages.|$|R
5000|$|Captain John Jackson of the Dallas filed a claim (called a [...] "libel" [...] in {{admiralty}} law) {{in federal}} court in admiralty in Savannah to be paid either $25 a head for the Africans on the Antelope under the provisions of the 1819 Act in Addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade, if they were free, or the <b>salvage</b> value as <b>property</b> lost at sea, if they were slaves of Spanish and Portuguese owners. In early August, libels were filed {{in federal court}} in admiralty that 150 or more of the Africans aboard the Antelope belonged to the King of Spain, and that 130 belonged to the King of Portugal. Later in August Richard W. Habersham, the United States District Attorney for Georgia, filed a libel in court that under the Act in Addition, the Africans on the Antelope were free, {{on the grounds that they}} had been removed from Africa by persons intending to sell them in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Ndalla {{strongly}} backed Sassou Nguesso {{when the}} latter stood {{as a candidate}} for the March 2002 presidential election. He was present for the launch of the support committee for Sassou Nguesso's candidacy on 6 February 2002, and on that occasion he elaborated his view that Sassou Nguesso was [...] "a symbol of hope, peace and freedom" [...] by symbolically assigning a positive characteristic to each letter of the name [...] "Sassou", in French: [...] "S is for security (sÃ©curitÃ©), A is for joy (allÃ©gresse), S is for concern for others (souci des autres), S is for the <b>salvage</b> of the <b>property</b> of the people of Mfilou (sauvetage des biens des gens de Mfilou), O is for organizer of peace (organisateur de la paix), and U is for national unity (unitÃ© nationale)". Ndalla subsequently worked on Sassou Nguesso's campaign as head of the coordination of the support committee for the Mfilou district of Brazzaville.|$|R
50|$|With the {{acceptance}} of the Act on Civil Protection and Civil Defence in January 2004 an integral system has become operational in Switzerland that serves to master natural and technological disasters rapidly and at low cost by integrating all relevant forces in a modular fashion. The main objective here is to minimise damage to life and limb or cultural property. The most important partner for the protection of cultural property are - apart from the civil defence and the police - the fire services. Their cooperation has been intensified since 2004. Together with representatives from the Swiss Conference of Fire Brigade Inspectors (SFIK) sequences, documents and strategies have been defined that enable optimum cooperation of cultural property protection and fire services. The cultural property rescue system (âCuresysâ) integrates cultural assets in the event of damage into fire brigade operations in order to ensure the most conservative <b>salvage</b> of cultural <b>property</b> possible.The military may also become an important partner for the protection of cultural property because troops can be called in for subsidiary operations in the event of natural incidents for example.|$|R
500|$|RMS Titanic Inc. {{has also}} {{attempted}} to secure exclusive physical {{access to the}} wreck site. In 1996, it obtained a court order finding that it had [...] "the exclusive right to take any and all types of photographic images of the Titanic wreck and wreck site." [...] It obtained another order in 1998 against Deep Ocean Expeditions and Chris Haver, a British Virgin Islands corporation that aimed to run tourist trips to Titanic {{at a cost of}} $32,000 per person (it now charges $60,000). This was overturned in March 1999 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that the law of salvage did not extend to obtaining exclusive rights to view, visit and photograph a wreck. The court pointed out that Titanic is [...] "located in a public place" [...] in international waters, rather than in a private or controllable location to which access could be restricted by the owner. Granting such a right would also create a perverse incentive; since the aim of salvage is to carry out a <b>salvage</b> operation, leaving <b>property</b> in place so that it could be photographed would run counter to this objective.|$|R
50|$|A wreck is {{categorized}} as property belonging to no apparent owner, that either sinks to the seabed, or floats {{on the surface}} of the water, whether it be intentionally cast overboard, or as the result of an accident. The term encompasses the hull of the vessel and its fixtures, as well as any other form of object on board, such as cargo and stores, and personal effects of the crew and passengers. This also encompasses the narrower definition of <b>salvage,</b> that is, <b>property</b> that has been recovered from a wreckage, or the recovery of the ship itself. There are a number of factors that contribute to the formation of a shipwreck, that can be divided into physical and cultural processes. A site can be affected by physical processes, that is, naturally occurring processes, such as the corrosion caused by salinity and ocean currents, or the growth of native and foreign marine organisms. It can also be affected by cultural processes, that is, by human interactions, such as adding or removing materials from the site of the wreck. Any archaeological activity, such as excavation, may also be considered invasive and tampering.|$|R

50|$|When a fire took place, a man {{was left}} behind {{in charge of the}} <b>salvage</b> if the <b>property</b> was insured. If there was {{uncertainty}} over whether the property was insured, but it appeared probable that it was, {{a man was}} left until the information was obtained later. The duty, if an important one, was divided into a day and night duty. This enabled an experienced man to be sent on day duty to meet the surveyor, and to carry out his instructions regarding the working out of the salvage; and a junior man at night. The day man, if working out salvage, would employ a number of men called strangers, over whom he acted as a kind of foreman. The working out might take the form of dividing up damaged goods into lots ready for a sale to be held by the surveyor, or of sifting over the debris to find remains of certain articles claimed for. If, for instance, a large fire occurred at a pianoforte manufacturers, and the debris was all in one common heap, the London Salvage Corps might have to arrange certain quantities of pegs and wires in order to give an idea of the number of pianos before the fire. The watching continued until the loss was settled, when the charge of the premises was given over to the assured.|$|R
