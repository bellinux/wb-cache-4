500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> that? Why is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
500|$|In what a Scottish Labour {{spokesman}} {{described as}} a bid to [...] "encourage transparency", the party took the decision to publish details of how its parliamentarians had voted during the ballot, a process {{that had previously been}} kept private. Those results showed that the parliamentarians who chose Murphy as their first candidate included Baillie, Brown, Curran, Dugdale, Gray, Kelly, Marra, and Sarwar. The MSPs Claudia Beamish, Rhoda Grant, and Lewis Macdonald were among those to vote for Boyack, while Findlay was backed by Clark, Ian Davidson, and Lamont. In the deputy leadership contest, Baillie, Boyack, Brown, Connarty, Curran, Gray, Kelly, Marra, Murphy, and Sarwar were among those to vote for Dugdale, while Clark's first preference voters included Connarty, Ian Davidson, Findlay, and Lamont. Having chosen Findlay and Boyack as first and second preferences, Lamont did not vote for a third, while Sarwar chose only first preferences in both elections. Murphy and Dugdale also chose no alternative preferences, Murphy voting for himself and Dugdale, and <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> likewise. The full results of the leadership contest were as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Stefani {{believed}} {{that some of}} the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, [...] " [...] were probably like, 'Why is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> this record? She's going to ruin everything'." [...] She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became [...] "Hollaback Girl". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, [...] "To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long." [...] Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, [...] "Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not groan, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not fall, [...] <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not shed a tear, [...] Nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> cry, 'Oh! mother, why [...] May I {{not enter}} here?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>done</b> it, too; and <b>she</b> <b>done</b> it {{beautiful}}. <b>She</b> <b>done</b> it {{so beautiful}} {{it was good}} to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> it again.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} to prefer charges against him, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not have to}} find him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy, dishonest, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to {{discover}} a fault of any kind in him, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not {{have to tell him}} nor his congregation why she dismisses and disgraces him and insults his meek flock, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to explain to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have to do anything but send a letter and say: [...] "Pack!--and ask no questions!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She.</b> <b>Doing</b> little, saying less, and {{thinking}} a great deal. I've hardly been out at all.|$|E
60|$|What was <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> She {{was looking}} fixedly {{into one of}} the corners of the room.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{gradually}} the heaviness {{of her heart}} pressed and pressed into consciousness. What was <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Was she bearing a child? Bearing a child? To what? ...|$|E
60|$|If I'm light-hearted, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it one way. If I'm {{depressed}} <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it another.|$|R
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that she knows what <b>she’s</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing</b> what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R. S. Gwynn, David Mason, and Deborah Warren, among others.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia frowned a little. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not like}} Mattie's expressions, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> like Mayflowers, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not dislike Chris Stewart, who {{had seemed to}} her merely a nice, modest, country boy. She lifted the flowers and {{buried her face in}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I shouldn't {{know what}} to say, either," [...] replied Janet. She smiled, but she had an odd desire to cry. [...] "What is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes!" [...] she cried. [...] "Of course, I {{remember}} all about it. The young lady {{who was with}} you--what was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there? Where is she now?" ...|$|E
60|$|LOUKA (avoiding him). No, I don't {{want your}} kisses. Gentlefolk are all alike--you {{making love to}} me behind Miss Raina's back, and <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> the same behind yours.|$|E
60|$|THE MALE FIGURE [falling on his knees] Oh <b>dont,</b> sir. Dont. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> it, sir: indeed <b>she</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|The haughty {{young lady}} also blushed. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not often blush; when <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> felt angry with herself.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth cast {{down her}} eyes. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not quite {{think it was}} a fault, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not say so.|$|R
6000|$|He saw Valentine's smile, {{and broke}} off abruptly. [...] "Anyway, it doesn't {{matter in the}} least to either of us. What is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here, and who are the others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leslie {{seemed very}} quiet tonight, didn't she?" [...] said Gilbert, {{when he and}} Anne reached home. [...] "What {{in the world was}} <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> over there on the bar alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes... Dear me! Arabella not in {{the depths}} of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. What is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there?" ...|$|E
60|$|At first perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not hear, {{certainly}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand, for {{her attitude}} did not relax its uncompromising stiffness.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> love him, and mistook the symptoms. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{her best}} to mistake the symptoms. But if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> truly love him, would it seem so queer and {{important}} and antagonistic as it did that his hair was rather thin upon the crown of his head? ...|$|R
60|$|When this {{conversation}} first commenced, Malleville was standing near to Wallace, and {{she listened to}} it for a little time, but she found that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not understand {{a great deal of}} it, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not think that what <b>she</b> <b>did</b> understand was very interesting. So she went away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Handsome and young!" [...] The judge's eyes {{took on a}} musing expression. [...] "Well, well! that {{accounts}} for much. But what was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{up there in the}} company of that old Dutchman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you know}} the girl? What is <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now?" [...] asked Miss Ellery, who had lost {{a part of the}} story as she sat in a shadowy nook with the pensive Fred.|$|E
6000|$|... "'He's {{been missing}} all the evening,' ses the cook, wot was {{standing}} beside me. 'If he'd been doing 'is dooty, the pore gal wouldn't 'ave been drownded. Wot was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> on the wharf?' ...|$|E
60|$|Hilda flushed at this, and {{answered}} with some spirit that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know, {{and that if}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> would not tell.|$|R
60|$|Of course Margaret {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not mind it, though in truth <b>she</b> <b>did</b> mind it, and {{was afraid of}} her aunt.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} his {{stand-up}} comedy act was funny {{and refuses to}} date someone whose work <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not respect ("The Ex-Girlfriend").|$|R
60|$|As to Grace, in {{the first}} place. What injury was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{to a woman who}} was dead? The {{question}} answered itself. No injury to the woman. No injury to her relations. Her relations were dead also.|$|E
6000|$|Something I {{had been}} dimly {{conscious}} {{of at the}} back of my brain came forward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars. What was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here? What right had she to step between me and my regeneration? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Met it, dear lady, simply enough! It's the old story, Mrs. Blessingbourne. The relation's {{innocent}} {{that the}} heroine gets out of. The book's innocent that's {{the story of}} her getting out. But what the devil--in the name of innocence--was <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> IN?" ...|$|E
50|$|Wilson confronts Stacy {{over her}} kiss with House and warns she cannot toy with him. <b>She</b> admits <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not know what}} <b>she's</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not heed him. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not even}} look towards him. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon Paul, and he read their message aright.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not move}} {{and there was}} no flicker of emotion on her face, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not look at him when she answered.|$|R
