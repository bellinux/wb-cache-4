40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar, experimentalmente, os coeficientes de recuperação do 111 In e do 99 mTc usando imagens SPECT. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Quatro diferentes concentrações de 111 In e de 99 mTc foram usadas para quantificar a atividade em esferas de diferentes tamanhos. As imagens foram obtidas com um equipamento híbrido SPECT/CT, com dois detectores. A reconstrução das imagens foi realizada usando o método iterativo ordered subset {{expectation}} maximization (OSEM). A correção de atenuação foi realizada com o uso de um mapa de atenuação e a correção de espalhamento foi realizada usando a técnica das janelas de energia. RESULTADOS: Os resultados mostraram que o efeito do volume parcial foi observado de forma mais significativa para as esferas com volume OBJECTIVE: To experimentally {{determine the}} 99 mTc and 111 In activity recovery coefficients in SPECT imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four different 99 mTc and 111 In concentrations were utilized for quantifying activity in spheres of four different sizes. Images were obtained with a hybrid dual-head SPECT-CT imaging system. The ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) iterative method was utilized for images reconstruction. An attenuation map was utilized for attenuation correction, and the multiple energy window technique for scattering correction. RESULTS: Results for spheres < 6 ml in volume were significantly {{affected by the}} partial volume effect. For 111 In quantification, results show a dependence on sphere concentrations and background levels. For 99 mTc quantification, there was a tendency towards values underestimation with higher background levels. CONCLUSION: Correction factors must be utilized for compensating the partial volume effect on objects with < 6 ml in volume for both radionuclides. Background subtraction to compensate <b>spurious</b> <b>count</b> present on SPECT images has a significant influence on the quantification of activity, especially for the smaller objects...|$|E

40|$|High {{statistics}} calorimetric {{measurements of}} the beta spectrum of 187 Re are being performed with arrays of silver perrhenate crystals operated at low temperature. After a modification of the experimental set-up, which allowed to substantially reduce the background of <b>spurious</b> <b>counts</b> and therefore to increase the sensitivity on the electron antineutrino mass, a new measurement with 10 silver perrhenate microbolometers is running since July 2002. The crystals have masses between 250 and 350 micrograms and their average FWHM energy resolution, constantly monitored by means of fluorescence X-rays, is of 28. 3 eV at the beta end-point. The Kurie plot collected during 4485 hours x mg effective running time has an end-point energy of 2466. 1 +/- 0. 8 {stat} +/- 1. 5 {syst} eV, while the half lifetime of the decay {{is found to be}} 43. 2 +/- 0. 2 {stat} +/- 0. 1 {syst} Gy.

40|$|One topical {{question}} in today's particle physics and astrophysics concerns {{the search for}} low-energy rare events. <b>Spurious</b> <b>counts,</b> resulting from environmental radiation, in particular neutrons, can easily overcome the signals {{of interest in this}} kind of research. Hence a quantitative evaluation of the neutron background and a full understanding of the parameters, which conditionate its intensity and energy spectrum, is particularly important. In this letter we will show and discuss the evidence of long-term fluctuations (in months scale) appearing in the measurements of fast neutron rate. The data were collected in the Baradello underground laboratory (Como, Northern Italy, 300 depth) from May 2002 until December 2003. We find a strong correlation between fast neutron rate and rain precipitation at the surface, but only when we introduce a phase delay of about one month between the timing of the rain flux and that of the neutron rate. We suggest that the fast neutron flux intensity is related to the moisture contained in the ground, which surrounds the laboratory walls, and we assume that the moisture depends on the rain quantity at the surface. The delay we find is consistent with the percolation time of the water from the surface to the underground laboratory. This mechanism should be taken into account as a possible systematic effect in any experiment which uses the signal rate modulation as a signature for a new physical phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} utility of Karhunen Loeve (KL) {{analysis}} in solving practical problems {{in the analysis of}} gravitational shear surveys. Shear catalogs from large-field weak lensing surveys will be subject to many systematic limitations, notably incomplete coverage and pixel-level masking due to foreground sources. We develop a method to use two dimensional KL eigenmodes of shear to interpolate noisy shear measurements across masked regions. We explore the results of this method with simulated shear catalogs, using statistics of high-convergence regions in the resulting map. We find that the KL procedure not only minimizes the bias due to masked regions in the field, it also reduces <b>spurious</b> peak <b>counts</b> from shape noise by a factor of ~ 3 in the cosmologically sensitive regime. This indicates that KL reconstructions of masked shear are not only useful for creating robust convergence maps from masked shear catalogs, but also offer promise of improved parameter constraints within studies of shear peak statistics.

40|$|Experiments on the {{mechanism}} {{and characteristics of}} a CO 2 ‐CS 2 Geiger counter are reported, and circuits and methods of operation which satisfy the special requirements are described. Counter: The active part is 2 ⅞ in. in diameter and 16 in. long, filled to 1 atm, 95 % CO 2 and 5 % CS 2. The cathode is copper and the anode is 0. 005 ‐in. ‐diam Chromel A. Characteristics: The electrons released by an ionizing particle become attached, probably to CS 2. The self‐quenching action of the counter is excellent, no <b>spurious</b> <b>counts</b> are observed {{in the absence of}} electronic quenching. However, a dead time of several milliseconds must be imposed electronically because of the long interval during which the negative ions arrive at the anode. Method: An electronic quench is used which is triggered both by the CO 2 ‐CS 2 counter and the anticoincidence ring. This serves to impose the required dead time and also to prevent the firing of the CO 2 ‐CS 2 counter by mesons. Measurements: The plateau was measured to 1900 v above threshold and was found to be level to within 1 % from 400 to 1600 v above threshold. The maximum drift time of the negative ions was found to be about 9 msec with a sharp cutoff. Tests with various combinations of gas indicated, but did not prove, that the charge carrier was CS 2. The effects of common contaminants were determined. At voltages over 400 above threshold, 1 % O 2 gave no detectable effect; 0. 3 % SO 2 gave a 2 to 3 % reduction in counting rate. Extensive tests of the efficiency were made. Comparisons of the CO 2 ‐CS 2 filling with an argon‐ethane filling gave identical results within the experimental error. No basis was found for supposing that there was any failure of the CO 2 ‐CS 2 counter to register counts. Reliability: The counter described has been used for C 14 dating purposes {{over a long period of}} time. There has been no indication that there are variations in counting rate outside those expected on the basis of statistics. The counting rate for ``dead'' CO 2 in an iron shield 9 in. thick and after anticoincidence is 8 per min...|$|R
40|$|Estimating and {{comparing}} microbial diversity are statistically challenging due to limited sampling and possible sequencing errors for low-frequency <b>counts,</b> producing <b>spurious</b> singletons. The inflated singleton count seriously affects statistical analysis and inferences about microbial diversity. Previous statistical approaches {{to tackle the}} sequencing errors generally require different parametric assumptions about the sampling model or about the functional form of frequency counts. Different parametric assumptions may lead to drastically different diversity estimates. We focus on nonparametric methods which are universally valid for all parametric assumptions {{and can be used}} to compare diversity across communities. We develop here a nonparametric estimator of the true singleton count to replace the <b>spurious</b> singleton <b>count</b> in all methods/approaches. Our estimator of the true singleton count is in terms of the frequency counts of doubletons, tripletons and quadrupletons, provided these three frequency counts are reliable. To quantify microbial alpha diversity for an individual community, we adopt the measure of Hill numbers (effective number of taxa) under a nonparametric framework. Hill numbers, parameterized by an order q that determines the measures’ emphasis on rare or common species, include taxa richness (q = 0), Shannon diversity (q = 1, the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (q = 2, the inverse of Simpson index). A diversity profile which depicts the Hill number as a function of order q conveys all information contained in a taxa abundance distribution. Based on the estimated singleton count and the original non-singleton frequency counts, two statistical approaches (non-asymptotic and asymptotic) are developed to compare microbial diversity for multiple communities. (1) A non-asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of estimated diversities of standardized samples with a common finite sample size or sample completeness. This approach aims to compare diversity estimates for equally-large or equally-complete samples; {{it is based on the}} seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves of Hill numbers, specifically for q = 0, 1 and 2. (2) An asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of the estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. That is, this approach compares the estimated profiles for complete samples or samples whose size tends to be sufficiently large. It is based on statistical estimation of the true Hill number of any order q ≥ 0. In the two approaches, replacing the <b>spurious</b> singleton <b>count</b> by our estimated count, we can greatly remove the positive biases associated with diversity estimates due to spurious singletons and also make fair comparisons across microbial communities, as illustrated in our simulation results and in applying our method to analyze sequencing data from viral metagenomes...|$|R
50|$|Parasitic {{oscillation}} is undesirable {{for several}} reasons. The oscillations may be coupled into other circuits or radiate as radio waves, causing electromagnetic interference (EMI) to other devices. In audio systems, parasitic oscillations {{can sometimes be}} heard as annoying sounds in the speakers or earphones. The oscillations waste power and may cause undesirable heating. For example, an audio power amplifier that goes into parasitic oscillation may generate enough power to damage connected speakers. A circuit that is oscillating will not amplify linearly, so desired signals passing through the stage will be distorted. In digital circuits, parasitic oscillations may only occur on particular logic transitions and may result in erratic operation of subsequent stages; for example, a counter stage may see many <b>spurious</b> pulses and <b>count</b> erratically.|$|R
40|$|Previously {{administered}} {{diagnostic and}} therapeutic radiopharma-ceuticals {{may interfere with}} performance of the Schilling test for prolonged periods of time. Additionally, presence of confounding radionuclides in the urine may not be suspected if baseline urine measurements have not been performed before the examination. Methods: We assumed that a <b>spurious</b> contribution of <b>counts</b> corresponding to 1 % of the administered Schilling dose would begin to contribute clinically significant interference. Based on the typical amounts of radiopharmaceuticals administered, spectra of commonly used radionuclides and best available pharmacokinetic models of biodistribution and excretion, we estimated the interval required for 24 -hr urinary excretion of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals to drop below this threshold of significant interference. Results: For previously administered ""Tc-based radiopharmaceuticals and 123 l-Nal, the interval required for urinary levels of activity to fall below thresholds of allowable interference arebetween 2 - 5 days. For 67 Ga-citrate, several 111 ln compounds, 131 I-MIBG and 201 TI-thallous chloride, periods of 12 - 44 days are estimated. Estimates for 131 l-Nal vary greatly between 4 and 115 days, depending on the amount administered, {{and the degree of}} thyroid uptake. Conclusion: Patients should be interviewed before performing the Schilling test to ensure that interfering radiopharma ceuticals have not been recently administered. The estimates devel oped in this paper can serve as guidelines for the necessary waiting time between prior radiopharmaceutical administration and the Schilling examination...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{physically}} inactive {{lifestyle is}} {{associated with an increased}} risk for a variety of chronic diseases and health conditions. One population at greatest risk of physical inactivity is older adults. Studies: The specific aims for my dissertation research focused on further development of the Actigraph accelerometer to measure physical activity in community dwelling older adults. I proposed to first further define what an "activity count" from the Actigraph accelerometer represents. By comparing Actigraph counts to raw accelerometry, oxygen consumption and pedometer step count data at usual and slow walking speeds we found that counts per second were correlated with raw accelerometry and energy cost. Actigraph counts, raw acceleration, pedometer step counts and oxygen consumption were higher for usual versus slow walking conditions as expected. We were able to formulate a regression equation to estimate energy cost from Actigraph counts in community dwelling older adults. For the next project, I investigated {{the reliability and validity of}} the various ways to present data from the Actigraph accelerometer. All Actigraph measurement units of interest were highly correlated with each other as well as with performance based measures of mobility, function, age and self reported physical activity. Actigraph counts per minute and standard deviations of counts were able to distinguish between low and high mobility and functioning groups. Using ROC curves, we established a cut off value of 150 counts per minute to detect mobility and function problems. Finally, I determined meaningful change values of physical activity measured by the Actigraph over a 12 week exercise intervention in community dwelling older adults with walking difficulty. We found a value of 30 counts per minute to indicate substantial change beyond <b>spurious</b> error. Actigraph <b>counts</b> per minute did not change over the course of exercise intervention. However, people who were more active at baseline exhibited improvements in mobility and functional measures compared to those who were less active at baseline. Conclusion: From the projects described above, Actigraph counts have been validated in older adults against raw accelerometry, oxygen consumption, mobility, function, and self-reported physical activity measures. Inter-rater reliability was excellent for the multiple outputs of the Actigraph accelerometer. Actigraph counts per minute data output is our recommendation since it is the default output, has the least amount of processing, produces high inter-rater reliability and validity against mobility and function...|$|R
