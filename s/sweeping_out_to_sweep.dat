60|$|For {{many minutes}} he stood entranced, his mind {{wandering}} in {{a species of}} calm delight over the grand scene, but incapable of fixing itself definitely on any special feature--now <b>sweeping</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> where the Scilly Isles could be seen resting on the liquid horizon, anon following the flight of circling seagulls, or busy counting the innumerable ships and boats that rested on the sea, but ever and anon recurring, as if {{under the influence of}} fascination, to that rich turmoil of foam which boiled, leaped, and churned, around, beneath, and above the mighty breakers.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} Admiral Johansen {{informed}} {{the captain of}} the Tryggvason, T.

Briseid was given orders to open fire on any hostile ships. Johansen shared his intentions to send the Rauma and the Otra <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the fjord. Briseid dispatched one of his ship's motor boats to Langgrunn where it told the merchant ships at anchor to extinguish their lights.|$|R
50|$|When {{the scandals}} of Tangentopoli were {{unveiled}} from 1992 on, Bossi rode the wave, presenting {{himself as the}} new man in politics, and set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> away corruption and incompetence. Bossi himself, however, received an eight-month suspended prison sentence, along with Lega Nord's treasurer {{at the time of}} the events Alessandro Patelli, for receiving a 200-million lire bribe in a trial that also convicted many of the politicians he routinely attacked, such as Bettino Craxi, Arnaldo Forlani and others. Bossi's sentence was upheld on appeal.|$|R

500|$|As {{early as}} January 1865, Union sympathizers in Georgetown had warned Dahlgren's forces about the {{existence}} of mines in the channel. [...] While approaching Battery White, the Mingoe had sent its boats <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> for such devices. [...] However, their efforts may have been perfunctory: according to Dahlgren's report, [...] "...so much has been said in ridicule of torpedoes that very little precautions are deemed necessary, and if resorted to are probably taken with less care than if due weight was attached to the existence of these mischievous things." ...|$|R

60|$|As March {{was well}} mounted, and {{known to be}} well {{qualified}} {{to take care of}} himself, his non-arrival threw his friends into a state of the utmost anxiety and suspense. They waited a couple of hours, in order to give him a chance of coming in, hoping that he might have merely been detained by some trifling accident, such as having lost his way for a time. But when, {{at the end of that}} period, there was still no sign of him, they gave up all hope of his arriving, and at once set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the whole country round in search of him, vowing in their hearts that they would never return to Pine Point settlement without him if he were alive.|$|R
50|$|Visibility {{during the}} storm was {{extremely}} limited and eyes were blasted by sand until water covered the beaches. Sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 PM the storm surge occurred suddenly, with the water rising several feet {{in a matter of}} minutes. The storm surge submerged the entire island and destroyed all of the buildings. The hotel, which held many women and children on the second floor and men on the first, collapsed, crushing many and <b>sweeping</b> others <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea.|$|R
5|$|Personnel {{from local}} Viet Cong units {{infiltrated}} Kontum and Pleiku to spread rumours of a ‘big Communist offensive’ on the aforementioned districts. In {{response to the}} rumours, the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment was sent <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the areas near Ban Me Thuot, Thuan Man, and Duc Lap. To maintain the secrecy of their operations, the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front ordered the 320A Infantry Division, which had by then set up camp west of Ban Me Thuot, to avoid contact with the South Vietnamese. Upon their arrival from Laos, the 316th Infantry Division received similar orders, and {{was not allowed to}} open fire under any circumstances. As the events in South Vietnam’s II Corps Tactical Zone were beginning to unfold, intelligence reports from Saigon continued to warn General Phu of an imminent Communist onslaught on Ban Me Thuot. Despite the numerous warnings which he had received from the CIA and his own military intelligence, General Phu remained convinced that Pleiku would be North Vietnam’s next target.|$|R

5000|$|Puerto Arista has thirty two km of wide beaches facing open ocean. From {{the beach}} area, {{the peaks of}} the Sierra Madre de Chiapas {{can be seen in}} the background, which are often covered with clouds. The climate is hot and semi humid with most rain falling in the summer. The average annual {{temperature}} is 27C. [...] These beaches have fine, gray, volcanic sand, flocks of frigatebirds visible. The surf can be heavy but this is not common. At low tide, the surf is gentler and safer for swimming. However, the most dangerous aspect about the water is riptides, capable of <b>sweeping</b> people <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. These mostly occur beyond the second line of wave breaks. There are no indications as to the safety of the waters and no professional lifeguards. In 2008, 27 of the 41 near drowning incidents in Chiapas occurred in Puerto Arista.|$|R

Patsey and Leigh were glad to spend the day in the town, visiting the cathedral, taking their meals at a restaurant, for the cuisine on board the boat was not of the highest character.|$|R

50|$|Now {{if all the}} (constant-length) tangents used in {{constructing}} the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, {{the result is a}} circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point) - and <b>sweeping</b> <b>out</b> a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and <b>sweeping</b> <b>out</b> a disk.|$|R

60|$|As I stood undecided, an {{invisible}} hand seemed <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>out</b> the two candles on the table.

With this I avoided the delay of striking matches; but for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the shadows I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step gained on this side of me and then on that. It was like a ragged storm-cloud <b>sweeping</b> <b>out</b> the stars. Now and then one returned for a minute, and was lost again. I was now almost frantic with the horror of the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted me. I leaped panting and dishevelled from candle to candle, in a vain struggle against that remorseless advance.|$|R

50|$|In {{the version}} of the myth told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, Phaethon ascends into heaven, {{the home of his}} {{suspected}} father. His mother Clymene had boasted that his father was the Sun-God or Phoebus. Phaethon went to his father who swore by the river Styx to give Phaethon anything he would ask for in order to prove his divine sonship. Phaethon wanted to drive the chariot of the sun for a day. Phoebus tried <b>to</b> talk him <b>out</b> of it by telling him that not even Jupiter (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the horses breathed out flames. He said:"The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion's jaw, Scorpio's cruel pincers <b>sweeping</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> encircle you from one side, and Cancer's crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins. Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!"Phaethon was adamant. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty {{because of the lack of}} the sun-god's weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of the Ethiopians to the surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into desert, drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river Eridanos.|$|R
