Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the <b>site</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} setting {{holds potential}} {{for renewable energy}} production from geothermal power. However, this conflicts with the national park's vocation of preserving the natural and cultural landscape. , pilot {{studies were carried out}} for two 5MW geothermal power plants, {{at the foot of the}} Piton des neiges and on the , on which a project had already been considered and later abandoned. Both sites fall in the aire d'adhésion outside the park's core area, but proposals have also been made for sites within the World Heritage <b>Site</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian {{government}} {{devised a}} program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down on al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the <b>site</b> <b>boundary.</b> This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.|$|E

500|$|This {{site was}} {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of several criteria. The plutonium pilot facilities needed to be [...] from the <b>site</b> <b>boundary</b> and any other installation, in case radioactive fission products escaped. While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The substratum needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It needed large amounts of electrical power (available from the Tennessee Valley Authority) and cooling water. Finally, a War Department policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges, east of the Appalachian Mountains, or within [...] of the Canadian or Mexican borders.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, the Manhattan Project was {{attempting}} to construct the first atomic bombs. This would require production facilities, and by June 1942 the project had reached the stage where their construction could be contemplated. On 25 June, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer recommended that the different manufacturing facilities be built at the same site in order to simplify security and construction. Such a site would require a substantial tract of land to accommodate both the facilities and housing for the thousands of workers. The plutonium processing plant needed to be [...] from the <b>site</b> <b>boundary</b> and any other installation, in case radioactive fission products escaped.

One of the monitoring posts is also indicating higher than normal level." [...] Dose rates recorded on the main gate rose from 69 nGy/h (for gamma radiation, equivalent to 69 nSv/h) at 04:00 JST, 12 March, to 866 nGy/h 40minutes later, before hitting a peak of 0.3855 mSv/h at 10:30 JST. At 13:30 JST, workers detected radioactive caesium-137 and iodine-131 near Reactor 1, which indicated some of the core's fuel had been damaged.
