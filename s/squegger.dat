5000|$|The Met and NPL radio {{teams were}} amalgamated in 1927 {{to form the}} Radio Research Station with Watt as director. Continuing {{research}} throughout, the teams had become interested in the causes of [...] "static" [...] radio signals, and found that much {{could be explained by}} distant signals located over the horizon being reflected off the upper atmosphere. This was the first direct indication of the reality of the Heaviside layer, proposed earlier but at this time largely dismissed by engineers. To determine the altitude of the layer, Watt, Appleton and others developed the 'squegger' to develop a 'time base' display, which would cause the oscilloscope's dot to move smoothly across the display at very high speed. By timing the <b>squegger</b> so that the dot arrived {{at the far end of}} the display at the same time as expected signals reflected off the Heaviside layer, the altitude of the layer could be determined. This time base circuit was key to the development of radar.|$|E
