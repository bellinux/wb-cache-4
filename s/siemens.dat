5|$|In December 2008, the German {{multinational}} <b>Siemens</b> {{agreed to}} pay an $800million fine to the United States government, and approximately €700million to the German government, to settle allegations of bribery. The settlement revealed that Menem had received about US$2million in bribes from <b>Siemens</b> in exchange for awarding the national ID card and passport production contract to Siemens; Menem denied the charges but nonetheless {{agreed to pay}} the fine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Siemens</b> {{stated that}} they would not be able to have the {{locomotives}} operational until mid-1999. By February 1999, <b>Siemens</b> had given up trying to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to <b>Siemens,</b> and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|Real's {{traditional}} away colours are all blue or all purple. Since {{the advent}} of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with <b>Siemens</b> Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ <b>Siemens</b> logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ <b>Siemens.</b> It is currently Fly Emirates which is set to expire in 2018. In 2015, Madrid signed a new 10-year contract believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), earning £59 million (€64 million) per season.|$|E
5|$|The {{light bulb}} {{manufacturer}} Osram (founded in 1906, when three German companies, Auer-Gesellschaft, AEG and <b>Siemens</b> & Halske, combined their lamp production facilities) derived {{its name from}} the elements of osmium and Wolfram (the latter is German for tungsten).|$|E
5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, <b>Siemens</b> sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside stairs and railings, and moving lights to meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal railings added and the toilets removed. The speed was also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but {{because of the lack of}} capacity at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by <b>Siemens.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Amtrak is in {{the process}} of {{replacing}} its fleet of EMD AEM-7 locomotives with <b>Siemens</b> ACS-64, PCJPB entered discussions to purchase several retired AEM-7s to test the electrification system and to serve as reserve locomotives in the event of EMU unavailability. Because of the delay in delivering ACS-64s, the target sale date for the AEM-7 was moved out to June 2016.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a <b>Siemens</b> and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The <b>Siemens</b> and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E
5|$|Communications usually {{consisted}} of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkgerät), navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the <b>Siemens</b> K4Ü, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder's control surfaces.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Malcolm Reid {{proposed}} the station's site {{as a possible}} location for a £80 million <b>Siemens</b> wind turbine factory. The factory would create 700 jobs and up to 1,500 further jobs in the supply chain if built. He has said the site would be perfect for the factory because of its close proximity to NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities. The factory {{is likely to be}} built either in Blyth or on Humberside.|$|E

Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, SAP, Volkswagen, Audi, <b>Siemens,</b> Allianz, Adidas, Porsche, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Bank and Bosch.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. <b>Siemens</b> guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. <b>Siemens</b> had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E
5|$|Oslo City Council {{decided in}} 2003 to order 33 new three-car units from <b>Siemens,</b> {{that would be}} {{designated}} MX3000. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the order by another 30 units. Following a labor dispute in 2006, {{it was decided that}} all rolling stock belonging to Oslo Sporveier would be transferred to a new holding company, Oslo Vognselskap.|$|E
5|$|The {{generators}} were {{manufactured by}} two joint ventures: {{one of them}} Alstom, ABB Group, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor; the other Voith, General Electric, <b>Siemens</b> (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are air-cooled, which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} lower price than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from <b>Siemens,</b> who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is {{a device that}} converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von <b>Siemens</b> {{was among those who}} recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
5|$|Although textile-related {{engineering}} declined {{with the}} processing industry, {{leading to the}} demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896. Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, but some of its former works continue in other hands. Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by <b>Siemens</b> Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.|$|E

5|$|Bournemouth Airport {{is among}} the busiest {{international}} airports {{in the country and}} is an important economic generator for the region. Owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group, the airport handles 800,000 passengers annually and supports around 900 full-time equivalent jobs which contribute more than £24million to the local economy. Between 2007 and 2010 the airport underwent a £45million upgrade which included {{the construction of a new}} departure terminal. Other major employers in Christchurch include: BAE Systems, Bournemouth Aviation Services Company (BASCO), Beagle Aerospace, Bournemouth International Airport Ltd, Channel Express, College of Air Traffic Control, Data Track Process Instruments, European Aviation, FR Aviation, Honeywell, Reid Steel, Revvo Castor Company, Sainsbury's, <b>Siemens</b> VAI and SELEX Communications.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in track}} laying and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, construction {{was reported to}} be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of synchronisation, TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the <b>Siemens</b> test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using weights to simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines. To supplement this, on 14 November 1996 the board of NSB decided to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired within five years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer <b>Siemens,</b> further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
5|$|His {{reputation}} as a composer continued to grow and in 1959, he was nominated as an Officier of the Légion d'honneur. In 1966 he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, although he had in effect been teaching composition for years. Further honours included election to the Institut de France in 1967 and the Académie des beaux-arts in 1968, the Erasmus Prize in 1971, the award of the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal and the Ernst von <b>Siemens</b> Music Prize in 1975, the Sonning Award (Denmark's highest musical honour) in 1977, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1982, and {{the presentation of the}} Croix de Commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Colorado had two first-round picks. Present at the draft, former Avalanche great Joe Sakic {{served his}} first duties as new {{alternate}} governor and adviser of hockey {{operations of the}} club. With their first pick, second overall, they selected Gabriel Landeskog, the young captain of the Kitchener Rangers. Second, they selected defenseman Duncan <b>Siemens</b> 11th overall, a pick acquired from the St. Louis Blues in the controversial trade that sent power-forward Chris Stewart, long time top prospect Kevin Shattenkirk and a second round pick to the Blues {{in exchange for their}} first round pick, veteran Jay McClement and 2006 former first overall pick, Erik Johnson. A complete overhaul at the goal tending position sent Peter Budaj to the Montreal Canadiens and Brian Elliott to St. Louis, Elliott having been acquired from the Ottawa Senators for Craig Anderson during the team's downward spiral the season previous. Goalie Semyon Varlamov was dealt to Colorado from the Washington Capitals for a first and second pick, while veteran netminder and former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jean-Sebastien Giguere was {{signed as a free agent}} in hopes to mentor the young Varlamov. Duncan <b>Siemens</b> was sent back to his major junior team, the Saskatoon Blades in camp, while Gabriel Landeskog made the opening night roster against the Detroit Red Wings on October 8, 2011, at Pepsi Center. Adam Deadmarsh was promoted from video/developmental coach to offensive assistant coach after Steve Konowalchuk accepted a job as head coach in the minor league.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 2007, {{the council}} {{approved}} the final business case. Approval was given on 22 December 2007 for TIE to sign contracts with CAF to supply vehicles and BBS (a consortium of Bilfinger Berger and <b>Siemens)</b> {{to design and}} construct the network. Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage {{the cost of the}} project was estimated at £521 million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the economic slowdown to save an estimated £75 million. The Granton extension was also cancelled.|$|E
5|$|On its inauguration the Pennsylvanian {{ran with}} then-new Amfleet equipment: two coaches and a cafe. Today the Pennsylvanian {{continues}} {{to use an}} all-Amfleet consist {{although the number of}} coaches has grown to six. The train consists of an Amfleet I business class car, an Amfleet I cafe car, an Amfleet I coach, and three Amfleet II long-distance coach cars. Motive power is usually a Genesis diesel-electric locomotive west of Philadelphia. East of Philadelphia, the motive power is a <b>Siemens</b> ACS-64 electric locomotive; an engine swap is made at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from <b>Siemens</b> as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to be replaced by the MX3000, as the line was to remain with overhead wires and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with pantographs. However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal to downgrade the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer <b>Siemens</b> to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E
5|$|<b>Siemens</b> and Vestas are {{the leading}} turbine {{suppliers}} for offshore wind power. DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.ON {{are the leading}} offshore operators. As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to BTM Consult, more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed {{before the end of}} 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the US.|$|E
5|$|Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 {{million in}} seed funding, which was {{followed}} by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations. About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer. By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding. Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments from a round that included {{four out of five}} of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: <b>Siemens,</b> Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com. Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT.|$|E
5|$|Six {{prototype}} trams {{were delivered}} by Strømmen in 1937, with four different motor solutions, from AEG, <b>Siemens,</b> Vickers and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). None {{of these were}} particularly successful, and the 40 serial production trams used conventional motors from ELIN. These were delivered in 1939, with 20 (class E) being used by Oslo Sporveier mainly on the Kjelsås Line, but also on other services. The remaining 20 trams (class B) were leased to Bærumsbanen, that used them on the Kolsås and Østensjø Lines, and later on the Ekeberg Line.|$|E
