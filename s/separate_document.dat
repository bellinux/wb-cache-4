25|$|In {{the early}} days of the United States, there was doubt whether a {{marriage}} solemnised in that manner was entitled to legal recognition. Over the years, each state has set rules for the procedure. Most US states expect the marriage document to be signed by a single officiant (a priest, rabbi, minister, Justice of the Peace, etc.). Quakers routinely modify the document to allow three or four Friends to sign as the officiant. Often, these are the members of a committee of ministry and oversight, who have helped the couple plan their marriage. Usually, a <b>separate</b> <b>document</b> containing their vows and the signatures of all present is kept by the couple, and often displayed prominently in their home.|$|E

25|$|A visa most {{commonly}} {{takes the form}} of a sticker endorsed in the applicant's passport or other travel document. The visa, when required, was historically granted by an immigration official on a visitor's arrival at the frontiers of a country, but increasingly today a traveller wishing to enter another country must apply in advance for a visa, sometimes in person at a consular office, by mail or over the internet. The actual visa may still be a sticker or a stamp in the passport, or may take the form of a <b>separate</b> <b>document</b> or an electronic record of the authorization, which the applicant can print before leaving home and produce on entry to the host country. Some countries do not require visas for short visits.|$|E
2500|$|Mariological {{issues were}} {{included}} in the discussions at the Second Vatican Council, (1962–1965) although the Council indicated that it had not addressed all Marian issues. The Council members had in depth discussions regarding the question of whether to treat Mary within the Constitution of the Church or outside it in a <b>separate</b> <b>document.</b> The final decision, by a vote of 1114–1074 resulted in the treatment of Marian issues within the Church Constitution, as chapter eight of Lumen gentium. Chapter eight of Lumen gentium provides a [...] "pastoral summary" [...] of Catholic doctrines on Mary, which does not claim to be complete.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} rule {{introduced by the}} Peeters directive is that all official documents have {{to be sent to}} the citizens in Dutch. Afterwards, French-speakers can request a French translation for each <b>separate</b> <b>document,</b> on their own initiative. As for the application of documents in the town hall, all these documents have to be issued in Dutch in the municipalities along the language border, after which a translation can be requested. For the [...] "rim municipalities" [...] (those bordering Brussels), a French translation can be requested beforehand. Such a restrictive meaning went against the existing practice, whereby citizens had to declare their preferred language only once.|$|E

2500|$|Mariologists {{had hoped}} for a dogma on Mary as Mediatrix, the {{foundations}} of which were laid by several popes especially [...] Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, and Pius XII. The preparations for the council included an independent schema [...] "About the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God and Mother of the People" [...] Some observers interpreted the [...] renunciation of this document on Mary as minimalism, others interpreted her inclusion as a chapter [...] into the Church document as underlining her role for the Church. With the inclusion of Marian issues within the Constitution of the Church {{rather than in a}} <b>separate</b> <b>document,</b> at Vatican II the contextual view of Mary was emphasized, namely that Mary belongs [...] "within the Church": ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{structural}} variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004 attempted to identify a pattern in these variations – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared {{to be part of}} an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as [...] "generations". [...] Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan & Norton) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism, later Kaplan & Norton designs the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy & Wetter (English translation 1999, 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a <b>separate</b> <b>document</b> describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the [...] "destination statement" [...] idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{citizens}} of all Member States of the European Union and Schengen associated countries {{are entitled to}} use the eVisitor system since 27 October 2008, the European Commission is still assessing whether the eVisitor visa fully satisfies reciprocity requirements. In its [...] Seventh report on certain third countries' maintenance of visa requirements in breach {{of the principle of}} reciprocity from 2012, the European Commission found that in principle, the eVisitor provides equal treatment of the {{citizens of}} all Member States and Schengen associated countries. However, while the average autogrant rate was high (86.36%), the quarterly reports on eVisitor application statistics showed that applications by citizens of some Member States are mainly processed manually. Autogrant rates for Bulgaria and Romania were at just 18% and 23%, as the majority of applications were sent for additional examination. The Commission therefore engaged to continue to closely monitor the processing of eVisitor applications. The Commission would submit its assessment of whether eVisitor is equivalent to the Schengen visa application process in a <b>separate</b> <b>document</b> in parallel with the assessment of the Final Rule on ESTA. Currently the Schengen Area does not have visa requirements in place for short-term stays of Australian nationals. The United Kingdom and Ireland are exempt from this particular EU policy, but still do not impose any short-term visa requirements on Australians.|$|E
