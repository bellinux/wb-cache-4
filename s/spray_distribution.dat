40|$|Possible {{reliance}} on static laboratory patternator measurements of <b>spray</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{as in the}} draft CEN Standard prEN 13790 (and already contained in EN 12761), contains the grave risk of inhibiting development of new spray technologies and techniques aimed at more precise targeting of sprays which {{have the potential to}} allow reductions in chemical usage rates and minimise risks of general environmental contamination. The use of patternators relates principally to achieving a uniform volume distribution pattern at a horizontal surface, and therefore may only be relevant for flat fan hydraulic pressure nozzles designed to achieve this. The assumption that biological efficacy, particularly for foliar and insect targets, can be predicted by patternator measurements made in a static laboratory situation is highly questionable. Relying on the use of patternator measurements of <b>spray</b> <b>distribution</b> to predict biological efficacy is questionable for a variety of reasons: a) measurements of <b>spray</b> <b>distribution</b> by a patternator do not relate directly to deposition on the actual biological target which will vary greatly with the application.

It focuses {{on the need to}} take account of the dynamic effects of the forward movement of the boom.

Mathematically, this is expressed by a convolution of the trajectory function with the nozzle spray pattern function. The model is validated through a dynamic test bench aimed at reproducing the boom movements observed in the field. The chosen method to measure the distribution of the spray deposits is a chemical dosage of the sprayed potassium chloride (KCl) solution collected in Petri dishes.

On hilly fields, the boom is not positioned parallel to the ground, resulting in an uneven <b>spray</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern and causing harm to the boom when hitting the soil. This paper models mathematically systems {{that are able to}} follow the slope of the field. The structure of the models is studied, which {{turns out to be the}} same for the four investigated suspensions. The analytically determined models are validated. A controller is designed to create a slow active suspension, following the slope of the field and filtering soil undulations, causing unwanted boom roll. The controller is implemented on a laboratory set-up and on a real machine. It takes into account the dynamics of the suspension and adds damping. Despite the low power of the actuator, a good performance is achieved. Possible performance enhancement can be obtained by increasing the resonance frequency of the suspension and by making use of a more powerful actuator. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on spray pattern uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on <b>spray</b> pattern <b>distribution,</b> 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and spray pattern) to assess sensitivity for predicting boom distribution errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the impact of nozzle setup and operational errors on spray pattern uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in <b>spray</b> nozzle <b>distribution</b> which may not be completely detectable by measuring spray pattern alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in spray pattern CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full boom <b>spray</b> <b>distributions</b> based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R
40|$|Lean direct {{injection}} (LDI) is a combustion concept to reduce {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx) for next generation aircraft gas turbine engines. These newer engines have cycles that increase fuel efficiency through increased operating pressures, which increase combustor inlet temperatures. NOx formation rates increase with higher temperatures; the LDI strategy avoids high temperature by staying fuel lean and away from stoichiometric burning. Thus, LDI relies on rapid and uniform fuel/air mixing. To understand this mixing process, a series of fundamental experiments are underway in the Combustion and Dynamics Facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. This first set of experiments examines cold flow (non-combusting) mixing using air and water.

Experiments were performed with three air swirlers with vane angles of 45, 52 and 60 degrees. The swirl number varied from 0. 58 to 1. 0 and air-to-liquid ratios from 15. 8 to 35. 6. A transition was observed in the liquid <b>spray</b> <b>distribution</b> for the 52 degree case, which unexpectedly produced twice as much signal than the 45 and 60 degree cases.

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate spray is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the spray pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate spray, which will definitely influence the spray characteristics, such as spray droplet sizes, spray angles, spray droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the spray pressure constant during the process of variable- rate spray has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of spray pressure for variable- rate spray, a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the spray volume was changed by adjusting spray pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The spray features concerning the spray angle and the spray volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input spray pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate spray through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the spray angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles. The spray angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when the spray pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of the spray volume distribution basically unchanged and the spray volume and the peak values of the <b>spray</b> <b>distribution</b> gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle.

The observed volume is calibrated with a traversed micro-target. A comparison is made between several photogrammetric and polynomial least-square camera calibration techniques regarding their accuracy in deep volume calibration at magnifications close to unity.
