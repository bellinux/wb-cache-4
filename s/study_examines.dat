A <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the effects of institutional change on age-based labor market inequalities in Europe. There is a focus on wage-setting institutions on the adult male population and the rate of their unequal income distribution. According to the study, there is evidence that unemployment protection and temporary work regulation affect the dynamics of age-based inequality with positive employment effects of all individuals by the strength of unions. Even though the European Union is within a favorable economic context with perspectives of growth and development, it is also very fragile.|$|E

The review was conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). Six studies of programs qualified for the review. Programs addressed {{a wide range of}} alcohol-related concerns in addition to alcohol-impaired driving. The programs used various crash-related outcomes to measure their effectiveness. Two <b>studies</b> <b>examined</b> fatal crashes and reported declines of 9 % and 42 %; one <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> injury crashes and reported a decline of 10 %; another <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> crashes among young drivers aged 16 – 20 years and reported a decline of 45 %; and one <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> single-vehicle late-night and weekend crashes among young male drivers and reported no change. The sixth <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> injury crashes among underage drivers and reported small net reductions. Because the actual numbers of crashes were not reported, percentage change could not be calculated. According to Community Guide rules of evidence, the studies reviewed here provided strong evidence that carefully planned, well-executed multicomponent programs, when implemente...|$|R

This <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> the experiences {{of past and present}} members of a popular Japanese online dating site in order to explore the extent to which Western-based theories of computer-mediated communication and the development of online relationships are relevant to the Japanese online dating experience. Specifically, their <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> whether social information processing theory is applicable to Japanese online dating interactions, and how and to what extent Japanese daters overcome the limitations of CMC through the use of contextual and other cues. Thirty-six current members and 27 former members of Match.com Japan completed an online survey. Using issue-based procedures for grounded theory analysis, they found strong support for SIP. Japanese online daters adapt their efforts to present and acquire social information using the cues that the online dating platform provides, although many of these cues are specific to Japanese social context.|$|E
