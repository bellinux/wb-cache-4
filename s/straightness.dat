5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from <b>straightness</b> and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
25|$|When {{working on}} <b>straightness</b> in the horse, a common {{exercise}} is used called 'shoulder in'. The exercise {{is the beginning}} of <b>straightness</b> in the horse as well as collection and can increase impulsion in the horse.|$|E
25|$|A {{horse is}} {{straight}} when the hind legs follow {{the path of}} the front legs, on both straight lines and on bending lines, and the body follows the line of travel. <b>Straightness</b> allows the horse to channel its impulsion directly toward its center of balance, and allows the rider’s hand aids to have a connection to the hind end.|$|E
25|$|Though {{he had a}} {{controversial}} action he was called only once for throwing and that for jerking his wrist. Importantly the <b>straightness</b> of his arm was never contradicted by umpires. The occasion of him being called was the match between Victoria and Queensland at the MCG in 1931. The umpire Andrew Barlow, no-balled him 13 times for his action.|$|E
25|$|Hanyu {{was born}} and raised in Sendai, and has an older sister named Saya. His name means a bowstring which is pulled tight, symbolizing confidence, strength, and <b>straightness.</b> His father named him, wishing him to be as hardworking and with strong mind. His parents wanted him to live a simple life, but be dignified, {{powerful}} and graceful.|$|E
25|$|On {{some older}} systems, the poles were raised and lowered using a long pole {{with a metal}} hook. Where available, these may have been made of bamboo due to its length, natural <b>straightness</b> and strength, {{combined}} with its relative light weight {{and the fact that}} it is an insulator. Trolleybuses usually carried one with the vehicle, for use in the event of dewirement, but tram systems usually had them placed along the route at locations where the trolley pole would need reversing.|$|E
25|$|There {{is always}} a judge sitting at C, {{although}} for upper-level competition, there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena— at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H— which allows the horse {{to be seen in}} each movement from all angles. This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which may be difficult for a judge to see from only one area of the arena. For example, the horse's <b>straightness</b> going across the diagonal may be assessed by judges at M and H.|$|E
25|$|After {{the civil}} {{engineer}} {{looked over the}} site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a groma, which helped them obtain right angles. The gromatici, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the rigor. As they did not possess anything like a transit, a civil engineering surveyor tried to achieve <b>straightness</b> by looking along the rods and commanding the gromatici to move them as required. Using the gromae they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Copson {{was born}} in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, and became a miner. Like his fellow bowler, Thomas Mitchell, he was a cricketing product of the 1926 General Strike. He took no {{interest}} in cricket until the Strike, when some fellow miners persuaded him to join in cricket on the local recreation ground while they were absent from work. His ability as a bowler of considerable pace and exceptional <b>straightness,</b> who made the batsmen play every ball was clearly revealed. In the next season {{he was given a}} place in the Morton Colliery team and, from there, he progressed to Clay Cross club in the Derbyshire League, and his success was such that Derbyshire engaged him in 1932.|$|E
25|$|In diffuse-porous woods, as {{has been}} stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water {{conducting}} capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, {{not the same as}} in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and <b>straightness</b> of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-18th century, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that certain progressions of mathematical reasoning recurred when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be done in more generality, and then applied to special cases. This method of studying calculus- and analysis-related concepts {{came to be known as}} analysis situs, and later as topology. The important topics in this field were properties of more general figures, such as connectedness and boundaries, rather than properties like <b>straightness,</b> and precise equality of length and angle measurements, which had been the focus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Topology soon became a separate field of major importance, rather than a sub-field of geometry or analysis.|$|E
25|$|A back march may be {{used when}} the band wishes {{to move in the}} {{opposite}} direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backwards, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backwards marching usually employs the same preference for leg <b>straightness</b> as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backwards, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.|$|E
25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners {{doing most of}} {{the work}} against South Africa in 1951, Statham had to do very little in the Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly seemed to take their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and <b>straightness</b> and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E
500|$|The {{portion of}} M-28 between Seney and Shingleton, called the Seney Stretch, is [...] of [...] "straight-as-an-arrow highway" [...] across the Great Manistique Swamp, [...] "though others claim it's , {{only because it}} seems longer." [...] The Seney Stretch is the longest such section of highway in the state, and [...] "one of the longest {{stretches}} of curveless highway east of the Mississippi." [...] The highway is often cited as the [...] "state's most boring route" [...] according to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and Hunts' Guide. The <b>straightness</b> and flatness over a great distance are given as reasons for the reputation of this stretch as boring.|$|E
500|$|Measuring up to [...] long, Eolambia {{is a large}} {{member of}} its group. While it closely {{approaches}} the hadrosauroids Equijubus and Probactrosaurus, which are both Asian, in the general form of the skull as well as various traits of the vertebrae and limbs, it is actually a more derived (advanced) hadrosauroid, {{closely related to the}} North American Protohadros. This grouping, based on the <b>straightness</b> of the quadrate bone and scapula, represents an isolated, endemic radiation of hadrosauroids. Despite resembling hadrosaurids – lambeosaurine hadrosaurids in particular – in several features, leading to its initial identification as one of them, these similarities have been rejected as either entirely convergent or misinterpreted.|$|E
500|$|Being {{known from}} a variety of {{juvenile}} and adult specimens, the changes Eolambia underwent as it grew are well-documented. The number of teeth in the maxilla increased with age, from 23 in a juvenile to 33 in an adult. A similar increase occurred in the dentary teeth, from 18–22 in juveniles to 25–30 in adults. While juveniles lack secondary ridges on the crowns of their dentary teeth, faint secondary ridges are present in adults. The size of the [...] "boot" [...] of the ischium also increased with age, as documented by Kirkland. Changes may also have occurred in the <b>straightness</b> of the shaft of the ischium, as documented by specimens discovered by the FMNH.|$|E
500|$|Intense {{flooding}} occurred {{throughout the}} Rogue Valley in 1955, and Little Butte Creek's meanders in the Denman Wildlife Area between Eagle Point and the Rogue River were blamed for severe erosion. The [...] {{section of the}} creek was subsequently bulldozed and straightened in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The <b>straightness</b> forced water downward instead of outward like a typical creek, scouring the stream bed down to bedrock and creating an unsuitable habitat for wild salmon. In 2007, a plan to divert the creek back into its old meanders was proposed. The $700,000 project involved building engineered riffles and log jams and adding boulders, extending the creek by approximately [...] It was completed in September 2011.|$|E
500|$|Good slotted {{lines are}} {{precision}} made instruments. [...] They {{need to be}} because mechanical defects can affect accuracy. [...] Some of the mechanical issues {{that are relevant to}} this include backlash of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and <b>straightness</b> of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth. [...] Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field. [...] Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength. [...] However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.|$|E
500|$|Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, {{the track}} was a walkway {{consisting}} mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, {{driven into the}} underlying peat. The planks, which were up to [...] wide, [...] long and less than [...] thick, were cut from trees up to 400years old and [...] in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, <b>straightness,</b> and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed {{on top of the}} first one to bring the plank above it level {{with the rest of the}} walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found.|$|E
2500|$|The term versine is also {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} deviations from <b>straightness</b> in an arbitrary planar curve, of which the above circle is a special case. Given a chord between two points in a curve, the perpendicular distance v from the chord to the curve (usually at the chord midpoint) is called a versine measurement. For a straight line, the versine of any chord is zero, so this measurement characterizes the <b>straightness</b> of the curve. In the limit as the chord length L goes to zero, the ratio [...] goes to the instantaneous curvature. This usage is especially common in rail transport, where it describes measurements of the <b>straightness</b> of the rail tracks {{and it is the}} basis of the Hallade method for rail surveying.|$|E

Richardson has suggested {{that it is a}} very ancient track way (based on alignment considerations). Butterworth postulates that it may be Roman (from naming evidence and its <b>straightness).</b> The main point is that the road appears to be of ancient origin and takes no account of the village ...|$|E
2500|$|Crawford played {{regularly}} for Surrey in only three seasons, from 1900 to 1902, while the side was captained by Jephson. Batting {{largely in the}} lower middle order, he was renowned for fast scoring, but Jephson wrote that [...] "he was essentially a scientific hitter not a slogger". He added: [...] "He was strictly orthodox in all his methods of attack or defence, and the <b>straightness</b> of his bat was a thing to marvel at... He will go down to posterity {{as one of the}} greatest straight drivers the game has known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{construction}} took a directional <b>straightness.</b> Many long sections are ruler-straight, but {{it should}} not be thought that all of them were. Some links in the network were as long as [...] Gradients of 10%–12% are known in ordinary terrain, 15%–20% in mountainous country. The Roman emphasis on constructing straight roads often resulted in steep slopes relatively impractical for most commercial traffic; over the years the Romans themselves realized this and built longer, but more manageable, alternatives to existing roads. Roman roads generally went straight up and down hills, rather than in a serpentine pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The Shiloh's gait {{is smooth}} and rhythmic. [...] Their long strides and flowing motion require good muscular {{development}} and shows in its prime when the dog reaches maturity. Even while in a flying trot, the <b>straightness</b> of their back should be maintained. [...] The full trot is steady and level, without swaying or rolling. [...] To help keep their balance, their feet are brought in toward their middle line when running. Forward reach of the dog should be as long as possible, ideally extending past the nose, giving the Shiloh the impression of [...] "flying". Faults in movement or carriage are serious.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a column}} is loaded {{suddenly}} {{and then the}} load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a drop hammer. The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (free) end and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than {{the length of the}} rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically-loaded column. The critical condition for buckling amplitude to remain less than about 25 times the effective rod <b>straightness</b> imperfection at the buckle wavelength is ...|$|E
2500|$|Harvesting {{occurs when}} the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to {{extremely}} uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once. The petioles and leaves are removed and harvested; celery is packed by size and quality (determined by colour, shape, <b>straightness</b> and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). [...] During commercial harvesting, celery is packaged into cartons which contain between 36 and 48 stalks and weigh up to 60 pounds. Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between [...] Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above [...] [...] Shelf life can be extended by packaging celery in anti-fogging, micro-perforated shrink wrap. Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced {{through the use of}} sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] denotes direct proportionality. That is, scaling by a {{constant}} [...] simply multiplies the original power-law relation {{by the constant}} [...] Thus, it follows that all power laws with a particular scaling exponent are equivalent up to constant factors, since each is simply a scaled version of the others. This behavior is what produces the linear relationship when logarithms are taken of both [...] and , and the straight-line on the log–log plot is often called the signature of a power law. With real data, such <b>straightness</b> is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the data following a power-law relation. In fact, {{there are many ways}} to generate finite amounts of data that mimic this signature behavior, but, in their asymptotic limit, are not true power laws (e.g., if the generating process of some data follows a Log-normal distribution). Thus, accurately fitting and validating power-law models is an active area of research in statistics; see below.|$|E
2500|$|Opening the innings, Watson {{drove the}} first {{ball of the}} match for four. He [...] "laid on to the loose ones without mercy", and after {{reaching}} his century with [...] "a long drive for 4" [...] he went [...] "merrily on his way" [...] reported the Christchurch paper The Star, [...] "and {{if we do not}} chronicle all his important hits, it is because their number was so great, and even newspaper reports have their limit". He was eventually caught at point for 175 when the score was 300. While the Otago fielding was good, The Star commented, [...] "it would not be going too far to say that their bowling was probably the weakest that has yet been seen in an Interprovincial match". An obituarist recalled: [...] "I remember no innings which contained more good hits and fewer bad ones, than this of Mr Watson. The bowlers failed to get near his wicket at all." [...] He said of Watson's batting in general: [...] "Perhaps the best feature of Mr Watson's batting was its <b>straightness</b> ... His favourite hit was the drive: woe betide the bowler who, deceived by his patient treatment of length balls, presumed to over-pitch!" [...] Watson's score of 175 was the highest total by a player on debut in first-class cricket in New Zealand. The record stood until October 2017, when Brad Schmulian made 203 runs in the first innings for Central Districts in the 2017–18 Plunket Shield season.|$|E
