40|$|This paper gives a unifying, {{abstract}} {{generalization of}} pattern <b>search</b> <b>methods</b> for solving nonlinear optimization problems. Pattern <b>search</b> <b>methods</b> are {{a class of}} direct <b>search</b> <b>methods</b> [...] - methods that neither require nor explicitly approximate derivatives. We use the abstract description of pattern <b>search</b> <b>methods</b> to establish a global first-order stationary point convergence theory that neither requires the directional derivative nor enforces a notion of sufficient decrease. We also discuss {{the relationship between the}} convergence analysis for pattern <b>search</b> <b>methods</b> and the analysis for both line search and model trust region globalization strategies; in particular, the fact that we can relax the requirements on the acceptance of the step, at the expense of stronger conditions on the form of the step, and still guarantee global convergence.
