25|$|A {{skid loader}} or <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> {{is a small}} rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{tasks of}} region or object {{segmentation}} and environment change detection in a 3 D context are investigated and tested on an autonomous <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader.</b> This is achieved through a technique analogous to background subtraction util-ising 3 D scan data which is first aligned before a voxel sub-traction operation against a prior map. We highlight the close {{relationships between the}} scan-to-map alignment, background subtraction and 3 D scan-to-map matching problems. The presented approaches take advantage of previous work on the multi-resolution occupied voxels list (MROL) representations for 3 D spatial maps. This prior work is augmented to provide a mechanism for fast local 6 DOF alignment with the same data structures (MROL) that have previously been shown to allow efficient global localisation. The new approach is then compared to an iterative closest point (ICP) implementation and was found to execute in a similar amount of time, but was more robust and accurate. The local alignment algorithm is inherently more amenable to the MROL representation with an associated reduction in implementation complexity and negligible parameter tuning. The hash value basis of MROL results in a map representation that can be both updated and queried in constant time regardless of mapped volume. The approach described was tested on an autonomous <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> {{as part of the}} dig-planning process by segmenting piles of material and detecting humans in the scene.

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 53 - 54) Machines {{have become}} indispensable {{as part of}} our day today lives. They have made a stand in various fields like agriculture, construction, mining, materials handling, excavating and general use in industries. <b>Skid</b> <b>Steer</b> <b>loader</b> is one such machine which has the ability to fit into all of these categories. Skid steer loaders are known the world over for versatility and maneuverability. These are agile machines which have become a part of most industries. Their ability of having various attachments makes them proficient in handling tasks, which otherwise would be difficult for a human being. For these skid steer loaders to work to their full potential a skilled operator is required. Among other safety features, these skid steer loaders need to be accountable {{for the safety of the}} operator. So the cab mounted on these skid steer loaders need to conform to Roll Over Protective Structure also called as ROPS and Falling Object Protective Structure otherwise known as FOPS standards. There are various standards laid down by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for these ROPS/FOPS cabs on skid steer loaders and other construction and mining equipments world over. This study deals with the composite modeling of ROPS/FOPS cab as per ISO 3471 : 1994 and ISO 3449 : 1992 Level I standards for skid steer loaders. In this research, a <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> model with the operator cab is constructed and tested for the ISO standards. A section of the cab is then chosen and its properties are changed to composite properties. An attempt is made to use Glass fiber/epoxy composite materials for the section designed in this study. In addition, a parametric study is carried out on the section to satisfy the current standards in the industry. It is demonstrated that the section with the use Glass fiber/epoxy with a pertinent orientation and thickness may present more energy absorption than the present steel structure. It is demonstrated that the new designed composite section with Glass fiber/epoxy may be more effective than the present steel structure. With the advance in computer simulations, finite element (FE) model of the <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> is used to predict the vehicle behavior in case of roll over. In addition, MSC Patran/Hypermesh has been used as the modeler and LS-Dyna as the solver to run the required simulations...|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{power systems}} have been {{extensively}} used in off highway applications like skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, excavators since many years. Work {{has been done by}} both industry and academia to improve efficiency, reduce noise and leakages in these systems. With increasing competition in the market, importance is now also given to operator comfort and machine productivity in off highway applications. ^ Mobile, off – highway vehicles like Skid-steer loaders are widely used in labour saving applications like loading earth into a truck, dig and move material on construction sites to, clean roads, clear snow from roads etc. To carry out these jobs in limited spaces, skid steer loaders need tight turning radius. For this reason, these machines have a short wheelbase which prevents the use of suspensions in these vehicles. The absence of a suspension system exposes the vehicle to ground vibrations of high magnitude and low frequency. Vibrations reduce operator comfort, productivity and life of components. This thesis will discuss control strategies for vibration damping of <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> using the hydraulic boom cylinder as the active suspension element, which is equivalent to a spring–damper. Along with vibrations, the machine productivity is also hampered by material spillage which is caused by the tilting of the bucket due to the extension of the boom. This dissertation will discuss the development of a robust path-planning control algorithm which adapts to the position of the boom to maintain a level load to achieve bucket self-leveling. Another reason for reduced productivity in skid steer loaders is slow in site travel speeds. This dissertation also concentrates on reducing the in-job cycle time by developing a control strategy to smooth speed shift the drive motors keeping the pump flow constant. ^ To synthesize these proposed control algorithms, high fidelity hydraulic and mechanical models of the <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader</b> are created. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation help in improving operator comfort and machine productivity. ...|$|E
40|$|The vehicle {{response}} of construction machines strongly {{depends on the}} tuning of the control system in interaction with the drive system. A compromise between performance and comfort needs to be found to fulfill the operators requirements on a high usability of the machine. In order to achieve an optimal behav-ior Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation techniques offer a suitable approach to determine the overall behavior in advance. Prerequisition is a realtime capable simu-lation model of the considered system. Therefore, in this paper the mathematical model {{of the system is}} au-tomatically adapted by symbolic model reduction al-gorithms in order to match real-time requirements on a given hardware.

40|$|Due to many advantages, {{swash plate}} pumps are wide spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or radial piston pumps are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as constant displacement gear pumps are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash plate pumps, their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical pressure mark of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and <b>skid</b> <b>steer</b> <b>loader,</b> there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications. By developing the variable axial piston pump A 1 VO to the requirements of lower horse power application, it is now also possible to realize such savings in lower horse power applications. Furthermore efficiency of the pump itself can be improved. An example of this is shown by way of the new A 4 series 33...|$|E

40|$|Between August 9 and September 19, 2009, Atkins {{conducted}} {{data recovery}} {{operations at the}} Hawkwind site (41 HS 915) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5356. Data recovery at the site was initiated as the location was subject to proposed highway improvements. The field effort included mechanical and manual unit excavation within a single 24 -unit excavation block. Mechanical excavation was conducted with a Grade-All, and fill was passed through a motorized screening bucket affixed to a Bobcat <b>Skid</b> <b>Steer</b> <b>Loader.</b> Approximately 139 cubic meters (m 3) of fill was removed in the excavation block during data recovery operations at site 41 HS 915. About 123 m 3 of sediment was mechanically excavated, and 66 m 3 of fill was mechanically screened. Sixteen cubic meters of sediment was manually excavated, and 12. 50 m 3 of sediment was screened by hand. The use of mechanical excavation equipment and motorized screen at Hawkwind was a strategy that was aimed at maximizing data return at a relatively low-density, poorly stratified archeological site while avoiding the cost and time-consumption associated with traditional excavation methods. Atkins archeologists collected over 3, 800 artifacts during the data recovery effort at the site. This total includes 3, 253 pieces of lithic manufacturing debris and 184 chipped stone tools. Included in the chipped stone tool total are 105 projectile points. In addition to 6 indeterminate dart points, the following types were identified: Catahoula arrow point (n = 1), Friley arrow point (n = 1), Ellis dart point (n = 3), Ensor dart point (n = 1), Gary dart point (n = 73), Godley dart point (n = 1), Morrill dart point (n = 1), and Yarbrough dart point (n = 18). One-hundred sixty-six ceramic artifacts were recovered from the Hawkwind site during data recovery. This assemblage consists of 157 prehistoric sherds, 7 burned clay fragments, and 2 modified raw clay fragments. The primary research objective of the ceramic analysis was to expand our knowledge of Woodland period ceramics in the Mill Creek culture area of east Texas and to assess how the ceramics from the Hawkwind site compare to other known sites in the Middle Sabine River basin. The study began with a detailed technological and decorative analysis of the ceramics recovered at the site. Next, employing the same suite of attributes used to characterize the Hawkwind ceramics, {{a sample of the}} ceramics recovered at the Resch site and the entire Folly site ceramic assemblage were reanalyzed, thus enabling comparability of the ceramic attributes associated with all three sites. These data, along with Perttula’s (2001) detailed analysis of the ceramics from the Herman Ballew site, assured that the ceramic assemblages from four of the major middle Sabine River basin sites were examined in a similar manner, therefore enabling a more accurate comparative analysis of the ceramics recovered from each site. Sixteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from samples including carbonized material found on a thermally altered stone, 10 botanical specimens retrieved during screening at the site and from flotation, 4 samples of carbonized residue found adhering to pottery, and the bulk organics from one ceramic sherd. The 16 radiocarbon dates ranged from 1260 B. C. to A. D. 970; however, all but two align with Woodland period occupations at the site. In addition to radiocarbon dating, a number of special studies were performed, including macrobotanical analysis of plant remains from flotation samples, ceramic petrography, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), microwear analysis of selected stone tools, and residue analysis...|$|E
