The purpose of the article is to generalize theoretical foundations of analysis of the concept of reasonable economy to determine strategic measures aimed at maintaining sustainable development of Ukraine and its empirical verification. The leading method of the research is the usage of the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model for analysis of interaction of indicators common in characterization of <b>smart</b> <b>economy</b> and sustainable development. The indicators were selected taking into account the specific character of modern economic development of Ukraine. This approach is based on the concept of sustainable development considered in the context of <b>smart</b> <b>economy.</b> Using multiple regression analysis the impact of smart economy’s factors is evaluated, sorted according to the PSR model, on the total greenhouse gas emissions (dependent variable) in Ukraine. The results of the model evaluation allowed to identify two factors that have the greatest impact on the total greenhouse gas emissions in Ukraine: Gross domestic product per employed person and the level of energy intensity of primary energy. It allowed to justify the priority of such strategic means as the stimulation of innovations, the <b>smart</b> <b>economy</b> and the promotion of green economy. They are the general indicators of the <b>smart</b> <b>economy</b> and affect the sustainable economic development of Ukraine nowadays.

In the European top-level football, like {{the case of the}} British Premier League, financial indicators have demonstrated that the factors that define <b>smart</b> <b>economy</b> can be identified. The new rules of the financial fair-play policies and the ever growing revenues for television rights have created a new market in sports economy, one that identifies itself with the criteria identifies in studies regarding <b>smart</b> <b>economy.</b> This paper comparatively examines the determinants of four indicators of the football team quality in the British Premier League, in order to find out whether a common set of potential determinants could be effective in improving all four indicators of quality, without worsening any of them. This allows finding what measures undertaken at the level of football teams could raise the football team quality. Considering the subjective and multidimensional nature of the football team quality, we first propose four indicators that might be appropriate to define this latent summative measure. Then we select a number of four potentially common determinants of the football team quality, and finally discuss the empirical results, based on panel generalized least squares regression models. The television broadcasting rights are found {{to be the most important}} determinant of the football team quality...|$|E

Openness of mind, openness of businesses and openness of innovation are the key characteristics and success factors of the global world today. Growth and development strategies are becoming <b>smarter</b> transforming <b>economy</b> towards creation of higher added-value products, services and more effective use of resources. Such a high-priority aim may be achieved by R&D activities, which raise the innovation growth and, positively influence productivity, thus providing a platform for sustainable {{growth and development}}. Productivity is perceived {{as the ability to}} properly use the production factors to create value-added, implement innovations and to maintain the country’s competitiveness. In the macroeconomic researches of different scholars (Solow, Saliola, Seker, Kathuria, Puharts etc.) special attention is given to the quantitative measurement of the various factors of growth and development. These researches have shown that one of the more accurate methods of the productivity measurement is a calculation of total factor productivity (TFP). TFP notion is closely related to the innovation concept as proved by many empirical researches. Industry and firm-level studies concluded that R&D investments to a great extent determine TFP growth. The aim of this research is to calculate the total factor productivity by industry both in Latvia and Lithuania for better understanding of economic growth and development perspectives in those countries.|$|R
