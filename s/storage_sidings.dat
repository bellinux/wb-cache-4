25|$|In 1917 the Princes Bridge {{locomotive}} depot was closed, {{and replaced by}} the Jolimont Workshops. Built {{as part of the}} electrification of the Melbourne suburban network, it was the main storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> located between the running lines. A footbridge ran from Flinders Street across the entire yard to provide access for train drivers.|$|E
25|$|An Australian Railway Construction and Maintenance Group {{also served}} in the UK. This {{formation}} arrived at Liverpool on 17 July 1940 and comprised a company and half of personnel {{as well as a}} group headquarters. It was based at a camp in the Woolmer Forest in southern England were it built several large <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> and conducted other work. The Railway Construction and Maintenance Group departed the UK in January 1941. The Group arrived in the Middle East in March that year.|$|E

50|$|An {{underground}} walkway allows {{passengers to}} cross the tracks, but makes the station inaccessible to the handicapped. The station has an unused freight <b>storage</b> building and <b>sidings.</b>|$|R
25|$|At Clarkston West Junction, the {{subsequent}} location of Williamwood station, a facing connection towards Clarkston on the East Kilbride line (the former Busby Railway) diverged; this was installed {{to give and}} alternative route for mineral trains from the Bothwell area towards Ardrossan and was opened in 1903. When the extension to Kirkhill and Newton opened the trains took that route instead. The Clarkston spur remained in place but little used, until it was closed on 29 October 1907. At Muirend a trailing junction from Clarkston was installed, but it may never have been actually connected at the Clarkston end, and served as <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> from Muirend during its lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Guideways {{were made}} of {{concrete}} and based on highway construction techniques. The varying topography of the airport resulted in both aerial and ground level guideways winding their way over and under public roadways. As the guideway entered the semicircular terminals or remote parking areas, it remained at ground/ramp level and under the terminal building. At these terminal areas the guideway branched out to serve various stations, bypass tracks and vehicle <b>storage</b> <b>sidings.</b> Additional bypass guideways were constructed as the airport expanded. At several locations along the guideway tug sidings were located near the airport service road, allowing a disabled vehicle {{to be removed from}} the guideway and towed to the maintenance facility.|$|E
25|$|It {{also found}} fault with the railway company's desire {{to run a}} peacetime service to {{maintain}} profits, even though the network was experiencing extra war-time traffic. Citing the pressure this would have put on signal staff to maintain the service, it also argued that the local train would not have even been on the main line if the passing loops had not been being used as <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> to store extra trains. It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe {{and in the process}} of withdrawal, and this was a risk that was not justified even in the environment of war.|$|E
5000|$|Part of the north-west {{corner of}} the eastern timber pond (No. 2) was filled in [...] due to changes to the railway layout north of the dock. In the late 1930s, the LNER closed the {{entrance}} to No. 2 pond and partially filled in its south side, and expanded timber <b>storage</b> and <b>sidings</b> for the dock to the east over {{the site of the}} former shipyard of Earle's Shipbuilding, as part of wider improvements to rail connected timber handling facilities at the dock.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consisted}} of a station building, goods shed, signal box, <b>storage</b> shed, <b>sidings,</b> crane and the only level crossing on the whole line for the A466 road. The station was closed completely to passenger and freight services in January 1959. Following the stations closure the level crossing gates were removed and the signal box has all but disappeared but the station and goods shed remain mostly on site. The goods shed, now minus its roof, is now the only surviving shed on the whole line.|$|R
50|$|A {{goods station}} is usually {{equipped}} {{with a large number}} of <b>storage</b> and loading <b>sidings</b> in order to fulfil its task. On the loading sidings there may be fixed facilities, such as cranes or conveyor belts, or temporary equipment, such as wheeled ramps for the loading of sugar beet.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{industrial}} and car <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> have been built on the line.|$|E
50|$|There are {{extensive}} {{yards and}} <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> (tracks) {{on both the}} east and west sides of the station.|$|E
50|$|Brecon Road was the {{location}} of locomotive sheds, a goods shed and yard, {{as well as the}} shed for the District Engineer's coach and engine. The yard had two operational parts: the coal yard, also known as the lower yard, where there were railway barracks used as sleeping accommodation for train crews, and the upper yard with <b>storage</b> and stabling <b>sidings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station lies {{under the}} car park of the {{hospital}}, between the hospital {{itself and the}} Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes. It has a single entrance and underground ticket hall, which gives access to two 96 m long side platforms on a lower level. Beyond the platforms at the country end of the station are several <b>storage</b> and reversing <b>sidings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between the Whitley {{house and}} Mt. Vernon the line {{passes through a}} few small {{communities}} that offer restaurants, shops, and convenience stores. There {{are a number of}} creek crossings that offer lovely views, however the bridges have been removed.The last thru train passed here in July 1986, after which, the line was ripped out almost overnight from 10 ft west of Main Street, to Popes Creek Rd area, Lebanon KY. Remain trackage was used to serve the grain mill on far east Main St, as well as car <b>storage</b> on downtown <b>sidings</b> near the depot. Track from Stanford to near Mt. Vernon were removed around 1993.|$|R
50|$|Even {{today the}} station is operationally the most {{important}} station on the Siegburg-Olpe railway, since trains are refuelled in the station and it serves as <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> at night.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} staffed and {{consists}} of a single island platform serving two bidirectional tracks. Additional bidirectional passing tracks and <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> lie {{to the east of}} the platform tracks.|$|E
50|$|The {{running shed}} had a triple gauge line leading {{down into the}} {{standard}} gauge <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> and then across the Field Railway where a short stub led into a field.|$|E
50|$|Having {{foreseen}} and {{to address}} the above issue, the FR announced a proposed £1.3M rebuild of Harbour station, to provide two separate and individually controllable platforms, each with their own run around loops. The project took three years to complete, requiring physical extension of the cob structure into the Irish Sea, compacting, extension of the platform, and finally a shift westwards of the alignment of the existing single platform and FR <b>storage</b> loops and <b>sidings.</b> Completed in March 2014 within the projected cost, {{as well as two}} platforms the project also delivered a new electronically controlled signal box and system with a distinct FR heritage appearance. The signalling work won the Signalling Award at the 2014 National Railway Heritage Awards.|$|R
50|$|The Athens Railway Station is {{the main}} rail station in the Athens Metropolitan area. Although not the largest (SKA and Airport are larger), it serves all {{intercity}} trains as well as regional traffic and is the one closest to the city center, thus being the most important. Until 2005, the station had 4 tracks, {{all of which were}} served by platforms, as well as <b>storage</b> areas and <b>sidings</b> for freight trains, which were situated in the western side. The old, now dismantled metre gauge line to the Peloponesse was further west and there were no platforms to serve it: the Peloponissou Station further south was the calling point for these trains. After works for the expansion of the station begun in 2005, the <b>sidings</b> and <b>storage</b> areas were demolished and the metre gauge line was closed and the tracks were lifted. Construction for 6 additional tracks and platforms had already begun. During construction, the station remains open, with only 3 operational tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{marshalling}} yard takes up {{an area of}} 280 hectares, has a length of 7,000 metres and a maximum width of 700 metres. When it opened it had a total track length of 300 kilometres and there were six signal boxes, 825 sets of points, 100 home, 115 distant and 688 shunting signals. As a two-sided shunting facility, Maschen has two train formation yards. The north-south system has a set of 48 departure sidings {{and a set of}} 16 reception sidings; the south-north system consists of a set of 64 departure sidings and a set of 17 reception sidings. Both systems are supplemented by <b>storage</b> and marshalling <b>sidings.</b> In addition, there is an eight-road main repair shop for the repair of goods wagons and an engine shed for the maintenance of electric and diesel-driven goods train locomotives with a two-road inspection hall and numerous open-air storage sidings.Two signal boxes are responsible for the yard, one for each system. Separate signal boxes that had been built for the marshalling sidings were closed again in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The DEPCO {{consortium}} also updated another existing depot at Ramsgate (see Ramsgate train depot) for the IKF with facilities including <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> for the Class 395 {{trains and}} light maintenance facilities.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the station}} is served by the ISAP and Athens Metro urban networks. There are train <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> for ISAP trains and a service {{connection}} between the ISAP and Athens Metro lines.|$|E
50|$|By 1977, Weilheim station had 23 tracks, {{including}} five platform tracks. East {{of the platform}} tracks there were the local loading tracks, five of which were north and five south of the station building. South of the building {{there was also the}} goods shed with a loading dock, equipped with two tracks and a loading road. West of the platform tracks were located freight and <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> as well as the roundhouse and the turntable of the locomotive depot. Most of the loading and <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> were closed and dismantled In the following years and in 2002 and 2004.|$|E
50|$|Owing to the Campbelltown to St Marys (Cumberland Line) trains now {{operating}} in peak hours only and terminating at Blacktown, and {{the abolition of}} The River (the St Marys to Wyong service), there is now no requirement for the electrification of the <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> on the former Ropes Creek Line. Overhead wiring between the points on the Up Main to the Up <b>Storage</b> <b>Sidings</b> and the electric train stop boards has been removed. The sidings are now used for the storage of track machines during rail shut-downs or whenever scrapped rolling stock is delivered to the Sims Metal recycling plant.|$|E
50|$|The station {{consists}} of a single island platform serving two tracks, connected to the station building by a footbridge. <b>Storage</b> <b>sidings</b> are located {{on either side of}} the station for track maintenance equipment.|$|E
50|$|About {{two decades}} a narrow gauge railway circled {{the area of}} the park. This Siam Park City Railway is now out of use, the trains are still dumped at the former roofed <b>storage</b> <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1972 by {{architect}} Rümmler {{it is the}} {{end station}} of the U7 line. <b>Storage</b> <b>sidings</b> for subway trains {{at the southern end}} measure about 350m. The next is Zwickauer Damm (returning for Rathaus Spandau).|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{electrification}} of {{the line}} from Riverstone in 1991, the yard was remodeled with the current train <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> laid on the northern side of the station and removal of tracks from the southern side.|$|E
50|$|At Sandstone Estates a 26 km line {{runs from}} Grootdraai in the south, northwards {{to the main}} farm, loco depot and {{marshalling}} and <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> at Hoekfontein, onwards via Mooihoek to a large loop at Vailima sidings/Ficksburg. and the village at Vailima. It first opened in 1998.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, St Marys {{became a}} {{junction}} station when the Ropes Creek line was built, primarily {{to serve the}} munitions factory in World War II. The line closed in 1986, being truncated into two <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> at {{the western end of}} the station with the overhead wiring removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station is}} located {{south of the}} Altstadt {{at the end of}} Bahnhofstrasse. The station {{building}} is on the northeast side of the Nuremberg-Regensburg railway. Immediately next to the station building is platform 1, then platforms 2/4 and 5. Beyond that there are several shunting and <b>storage</b> <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Network Rail {{submitted}} a planning application in August 2009; the development was split across sites {{east of the}} main railway line: the main maintenance building was north of Hornsey railway station and the A504 road (High Street/Turnpike Lane); <b>storage</b> <b>sidings</b> were located south-east of Hornsey station, adjacent to the pre-existing Hornsey EMU depot.|$|E
