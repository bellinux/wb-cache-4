40|$|Background: In vitro {{measurements}} of <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> {{are used to}} assess their reliability in terms of photoprotection and photo-stability. Objective: In this study, several substrates have been fully characterized for in vitro sunscreen testing. Methods: The following different substrates have been utilised in the study: roughened PMMA plates, Transpore, Vitro-Skin, roughened quartz plate and a laboratory prepared roughened PTFE plate. The suitability of these substrates for SPF evaluation has been investigated by performing total absorbance {{measurements of}} seven <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> with different SPF values produced by the same manufacturer. Results and conclusions: Application of <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> on Transpore, roughened quartz plate, PMMA, PTFE and Vitro-Skin was performed efficiently. With regard to photo-stability of the substrate materials, only PMMA plate, PTFE and roughened quartz plate showed to be photo-stable after UV irradiation. With regard to SPF tests, our results indicate that Transpore, roughened quartz plate and Vitro-Skin are preferable to assess SPF values because of a better correlation between in vitro and in vivomeasurements. Our study also confirms that an initial calibration must be performed for <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> labelled with different SPF values.

Consequently, we have developed an in silico model to prioritize single ingredient estrogen receptor activity for use when actual animal data are inadequate, equivocal, or absent.

For this experimental study, the external micrographs of the SLNs show that they are usually spherical, nonporous and uniform with a smooth surface. The particle’s diameter varied between about 330 to 500 nm and the encapsulation efficiencies ranged from 77. 8 to 89. 2 %. The diameter of BEMT particle encapsulated by solid lipid capsules with 50 wt% polyol content decreased to 330 nm compared to 20 wt%, but the loading capacity did not change. It can be as-certained that BEMT‐SLNs shows a small third peak indicating the βi form and a lower crystallinity index (C. I.) value. The residual BEMT content gradually decreased to 80. 9 % over 12 h as a result of UV radiation, but the residual BEMT content with an encapsulated solid lipid decreased only to 92. 3 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Sunscreens {{are being}} widely {{used to reduce}} {{exposure}} to harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The fact that some sunscreens are photounstable {{has been known for}} many years. Since the UV-absorbing ingredients of sunscreens may be photounstable, especially in the long wavelength region, it is of great interest to determine their degradation during exposure to UV radiation. Our aim was to investigate the photostability of seven commercial <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> after natural UV exposure (UVnat) and artificial UV exposure (UVart). Methods Seven commercial sunscreens were studied with absorption spectroscopy. <b>Sunscreen</b> <b>product,</b> 0. 5 mg/cm 2, was placed between plates of silica. The area under the curve (AUC) in the spectrum was calculated for UVA (320 – 400 nm), UVA 1 (340 – 400 nm), UVA 2 (320 – 340 nm) and UVB (290 – 320 nm) before (AUC before) and after (AUC after) UVart (980 kJ/m 2 UVA and 12 kJ/m 2 of UVB) and before and after UVnat. If theAUC Index (AUCI), defined as AUCI = AUC after /AUC before, was > 0. 80, the sunscreen was considered photostable. Results Three sunscreens were unstable after 90 min of UVnat; in the UVA range the AUCI was between 0. 41 and 0. 76. In the UVB range one of these sunscreens was unstable with an AUCI of 0. 75 after 90 min. Three sunscreens were photostable after 120 min of UVnat; in the UVA range the AUCI was between 0. 85 and 0. 99 and in the UVB range between 0. 92 and 1. 0. One sunscreen showed in the UVA range an AUCI of 0. 87 after UVnat but an AUCI of 0. 72 after UVart. Five of the sunscreens were stable in the UVB region.

40|$|<b>Sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> often contain {{combinations}} of ultraviolet (UV) -filters {{in order to}} achieve broad spectrum protection from exposure to sunlight. The inclusion of both chemical and physical UV-filters in these products, however, increases the possibility for both photolytic and photocatalytic reactions to occur. This study investigated the effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particle size on the photostability of the chemical UV-filters butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane (BMDM) and octocrylene (OC) formulated in a microemulsion. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline Q 1 B for photostability testing of new active substances and medicinal products was applied. BMDM and OC in the microemulsion were irradiated with simulated sunlight in the presence of nano- (< 25 nm) and micro-TiO 2 (~ 0. 6 μm) and their concentrations determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. For the combination of BMDM and OC, the photodegradation for BMDM was found to be 12 % higher in the presence of nano-TiO 2 as compared to that of the micro-TiO 2. This enhanced photodegradation is attributed to the larger surface area of the nano-TiO 2 and the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because of these findings, <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> containing chemical UV-filters and nano-TiO 2 should be regarded with caution, due to the potential loss of photoprotection...|$|R

It is thus a concern that the photostability testing as described by the ICH Guideline Q 1 B is not a requirement for <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products</b> in Australia, Europe or the USA. UV-filter photodegradants have in addition {{been shown to be}} toxic, highlighting the importance of their separation from the parent UV-filters.

Validation according to the ICH guidelines for linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and robustness was confirmed. The developed and validated method was then successfully applied to the determination of BMDM and OC in an aqueous cream base, typically used in sunscreens, after photostability testing, according to the ICH Guideline Q 1 B.

In order to reproduce the conditions prevalent in commercial <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products,</b> the stabilizing efficacy of quercetin was evaluated in model creams containing BMDBM (3 %, w/w) together with OMC (4 %, w/w) and exposed to a solar simulator at an irradiance corresponding to natural sunlight.

Addition of quercetin to the sunscreen formulation significantly reduced the photodegradation of BMDBM and OMC from 40. 3 %± 2. 4 to 27. 7 %± 2. 6 and from 51. 3 %± 2. 1 to 42. 2 %± 2. 0, respectively. Moreover, comparative photodegradation studies demonstrated that quercetin was much more effective and at a lower concentration than commonly used stabilizer (octocrylene) and antioxidants (vitamin E, butylated hydroxyanisole). In vitro determination of the UVB and UVA protection parameters showed that the quercetin-based formulation fulfilled the official requirements on <b>sunscreen</b> <b>products.</b> Because of its photostabilizing and multiple antioxidant properties, quercetin represents a useful additive for the formulation of effective broad-spectrum sunscreens containing BMDBM and OMC...|$|R
