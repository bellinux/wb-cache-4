25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a <b>semantic</b> <b>field.</b> The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. <b>Semantic</b> <b>field</b> theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. <b>Semantic</b> <b>field</b> theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> further.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above cited in bold font are {{somewhat}} standardized and hence less-rich lexical choices for the <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha klesha) they denote.|$|E
40|$|The {{model of}} derived {{uncorrelated}} <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> {{generated by the}} method of principal components and singular decomposition of the matrix of <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> frequencies has been considered. This model describes a new semantic space with orthonormal basis of displaying text documents. The dimension of the space of derived <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> is significantly less than the dimension of the space of initial <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> {{as a result of}} replacement of interconnected components by uncorrelated semantic characteristics. The analysis of the test sample of text documents showed the possibility to take into consideration only those components of secondary <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> which are described by the first singular numbers. The use of the low-dimension orthonormal basis of derived <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> can be effective in the problems of the text data classification and clustering. ??????????? ?????? ????????????????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ???????????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ????????????? ?????. ??? ?????? ??????????????? ????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????????????? ????????????????. ?????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????, ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ????? ???? ??????????? ? ??????? ????????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ??????...|$|R

25|$|As {{inanimate objects}} cover the classes II, III and IV, it's not {{transparent}} into which class an inanimate object belongs. However, {{there are certain}} tendencies based on the <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> of the nouns. Nouns {{that are able to}} move (like sun, moon, star, lightning, car, train) usually belong to class III, while products that traditionally {{have to do with the}} work of women (like clothes or berries and also milk) often belong to class II. Clothes made from leather are—as the word for leather itself—usually assigned to class III, due to their relation to animals.|$|E

We examine this belief by distinguishing between cultures and institutions. The former generate <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> within which the latter emerge and with which they interact. We draw on a conceptual framework, the I-Space, to describe <b>semantic</b> <b>fields,</b> to locate institutions within these, and to yield distinct sectors and organizational types. We also look at how ICTs modify <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> as well as the distribution of institutions interacting within them.

40|$|The article deals 'with the {{peculiarities of}} {{organizing}} {{the information on the}} English book dust jackets, lexico-semantic properties of the language units and relations between the lexical items. The main semantic dimensions and <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> were identified considering the vocabulary of English book jackets. Application of the semantic analysis gave us proofs that language on the English book dust jackets is organized in a mental lexicon with particular semantic features that were demonstrated via semantic dimensions and <b>semantic</b> <b>fields.</b> English book dust jacket is presented as an informational-advertising type comprising texts with their specific features. The mini-texts are organized in the informational blocks that reveal diverse functions. That’s why it seems to be crucial to consider language units from different perspectives - lexical, semantic and cognitive and take a view at different kinds and types of meanings to show how they fit into the total composite effect of a book jacket lexicon. The paper presents a first look at the semantic structure of the information associated with the vocabulary of the English book jackets and aims at analyzing the lexemes and attempt to organize them in the <b>semantic</b> <b>fields.</b> We conducted a semantic analysis and defined <b>semantic</b> <b>fields</b> created for getting general overview of a particular domain of content...|$|R

2500|$|Early Icelandic {{vocabulary}} {{was largely}} Old Norse. The introduction of Christianity to Iceland in the 11th century {{brought with it}} a need to describe new religious concepts. The majority of new words were taken from other Scandinavian languages; [...] ("church"), for example. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic: French brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> of trade and commerce have been borrowed from Low German because of trade connections. In the late 18th century, language purism began to gain noticeable ground in Iceland and since the early 19th century {{it has been the}} linguistic policy of the country (see linguistic purism in Icelandic). Nowadays, it is common practice to coin new compound words from Icelandic derivatives.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} varieties of anglicisms which are largely differentiated on {{the way in which they}} entered the language. One type of anglicism is a calque, or a direct translation from English.

[...] Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of the English term such as [...] "business" [...] or [...] "start-up". Additionally, some English words in French may not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word [...] "golf" [...] which has an increased <b>semantic</b> <b>field,</b> referring to not just the game of golf but also a golf course as in [...] "on va aller au golf" [...] (trans: we're going to the golf course).|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the field theory of {{semantics}} is the lexical field theory introduced by Jost Trier in the 1930s, although according to John Lyons it has historical roots in the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder. In the 1960s Stephen Ullmann saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society. For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same <b>semantic</b> <b>field,</b> and the <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> was simply a lexical category, which he described as a lexical field. Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and semantic networks. In the 1980s Eva Kittay developed a <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> theory of metaphor. This approach {{is based on the}} idea that the items in a <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field. Sue Atkins and Charles J. Fillmore in the 1990s proposed frame semantics as an alternative to <b>semantic</b> <b>field</b> theory.|$|E
