This accelerated transport is {{associated with an increased}} frequency of pendular movements in the isthmic segment of the oviduct, with increased levels of the gap junction (GJ) component Connexin (Cx) 43, and is antagonised by progesterone (P). In the present study, we investigated the effect of these hormones on the instant and directional velocity of pendular movements {{and the role of the}} GJ and its Cx 43 component in the kinetic response of the oviduct to E 2 and P. Using microspheres as egg surrogates, microsphere instant velocity (MIV) was measured following treatment with E 2, P or P+ E 2, which accelerate or delay egg transport. Microspheres were delivered into the oviduct of rats on Day 1 of pregnancy and their movement within the isthmic segment was recorded. Oestrogen increased MIV with faster movement towards the uterus. After P or P+ E 2, MIV was similar to that in the control group. Two GJ uncouplers, namely 18 alpha- and 18 beta- glycyrrhetinic acid, blocked the effect of E 2 on MIV. Connexin 43 mRNA levels increased over that seen in control with all treatments. In conclusion, the effects of E 2 on MIV resulted in faster movements that produced accelerated egg transport towards the uterus.

40|$|In this Thesis {{we study}} {{theoretically}} {{some aspects of}} the dynamics of soft active suspensions. Following a bottom-up approach, we derive the continuum equations for a suspension starting from underlying models for the microscopic dynamics, where the microscopic objects are constructed out of spheres subjected to forces at low Reynolds number. Examples of systems examined here are collections of rotating objects in two dimensions, swimmers and a chain of oscillators. Their macroscopic properties are described by means of scalar and pseudo-scalar or vector and tensor or complex-valued quantities. In our work we explicitly address the fast, periodic nature of the microscopic dynamics and devise a general framework, that is based on a procedure of averaging, to incorporate these dynamical features and study their effects on the long-wavelength, low-frequency description of the system. There, all the resulting parameters are determined by time-averages of the microscopic properties. By exploiting a superposition of rotations we introduce a novel, minimal model swimmer at low Reynolds number that can both translate and rotate in a plane. We examine its dynamics by extending the analysis of the internal motions to the regime of strong deformation and compare to the well-known three-bead swimmer under the same conditions. For swimmers suspensions we consider a model where it is possible to generate spatially homogeneous symmetry breaking and examine its stability to small fluctuations. We find that the hydrodynamic interactions are enough to promote order; this, however, is unstable to small perturbations that exceed a critical angle from the ordering direction. Finally we introduce a new generic model of self-sustained oscillator to study hydrodynamic synchronisation. Here we find an interplay between hydrodynamic interactions and the oscillators features that make them good <b>synchronisers.</b> We then investigate the long-wavelengths dynamics of an array.

40|$|New payload {{concepts}} of low cost earth stations for future mobile satellite communications {{can only be}} realised by using dedicated on-board processing satellites. The satellite uplink and downlink are optimised {{by the use of}} FDMA/SCPC for uplink and TDM on the down link. This scheme allows mobile transmitters to transmit a narrow band, low power signal, resulting in smaller dishes and HPAs with lower output power. On the uplink, there are hundreds of FDM channels to be demodulated on-board. The most promising approach is the use of all-digital multicarrier demodulators (MCDs), where analogue and digital hardware are efficiently shared amongst the channels and digital signal processing is used at an early stage to take advantage of VLSI technology. A MCD consists of a channeliser for separation of FDM channels followed by individual demodulators for each channel. The major research areas in MCD's are efficient implementation of channelisers and the optimal demodulation algorithms for the demodulator. This thesis is focused on the demodulator part of an MCD using OQPSK modulation which haye received attention recently due to its spectral advantages in non-linear mobile satellite channels. Most of the research carried out on the OQPSK modulation has been addressed to its spectral performance under satellite channel non-linearities, but little {{attention has been paid to}} efficient receiver designs. The most important requirements of the demodulator in a mobile environment is fast acquisition with minimum overhead. This over-head includes long preambles in data frames to aid the acquisition of the carrier and the symbol timing recovery loops. In this thesis, research on preambleless all-digital demodulators for OQPSK has been carried out. The performance of the most suitable OQPSK synchronisation algorithms have been evaluated using extensive computer simulations. These algorithms have been selected after a comprehensive survey of digital synchronisation techniques. It is shown how these algorithms are related to the maximum likelihood (ML) principle and these algorithms are classified according to their technique of parameter extraction from the likelihood function. The synchronisation problems associated with OQPSK are pointed out with possible solutions. On the basis of the performance results of individual <b>synchronisers,</b> various demodulation algorithms for OQPSK have been developed for fixed, mobile and deep space applications. The DSP implementation of the all- digital OQPSK demodulator developed for the MCD for mobile applications is described in detail and its performance compared with simulation results...|$|R

Our " Take-Make-Waste " society is not sustainable. Systemic solutions must arise at local and global levels. HOW chronobiology, for a better healthcare, and lithotherapy, for a better welfare, could be useful systemic solutions for prevention of such systemic problems? The temporal organisation of living systems is evidenced as an innate and inheritable specific network of clocks that cannot be changed. But knowing these endogenous clocks functioning allows to understand WHEN and WHY therapeutic strategies are efficient or not. Sleep agenda recording and individual vigil chronotypes determination and their respect {{is the best way}} to avoid scholars' failure. Performance changes are depending on chronotypes and societal time changes. Results of students' competency tests (reports, talks, experimentations) are significantly increased (from 20 % to 50 %) when done AT THE RIGHT TIME. Man is an Earth clock shaped species. The minimal and maximal durations of all sleep cycles of a night obey a relationship that results from interactions between endogenous clocks and exogenous ones. All Earth living systems share a common ecoexotope of survival that is temporally structured by solar, lunar and terrestrial rhythms. These rhythms are <b>synchronisers</b> for our endophysiotope clocks. But some people are more sensitive to them than others and someones are resistant. Man night sleep changes depend on lunar cycles entrainment. Our Earth-hosted organism is physiologically structured with Earth as a fixed point and the analysis of sleep records points to circa-annual solar rhythms that can be considered as controls for the evidence of circa-monthly lunar rhythms. WHAT methodology to evidence temporal organisations of living systems and their physiological responses? Only individual longitudinal measurements must be used. Into controlled network of clocks, different frequencies are running depending on responses to endogenous or exogenous changes. Not only " on " stimuli but also " off " ones have effects. For 1 clock, its latency phase duration is always equal to at least 1 period of the rhythm. HOW long is the latency of a network of clocks? WHAT methodology to evidence lithotherapeutic effects? Stimuli responses must be tested according to a double-blind placebo-controlled survey. WHAT mineral to use FOR WHAT to do? It is a a priori complex study! WHAT scaling to use?, FOR WHAT treatment?, WHAT mineral to chose and WHY?, HOW and WHEN to treat? The characterisation of jade or jasper varieties, for example, is a challenge. The first difficulty is to identify commercial affordable sources of jade, nephrite and serpentinite, for testing for treatment of night urination difficulties. Each control, placebo or treatment record is lasting at least 120 days. Compared with control, jadeite or nephrite enhances night quality with a decrease of at least 15 fold of awakenings and urinations. Depending on the jade variety, and its trace elements, properties change. Nephrite suits better with a 20 fold enhancement. The highest of all placebo effects was below a 4 fold increase. The mineral crystal structure is evidenced to have an action. The area of contact of a stone with the skin is the limiting factor of an energy transfer.

They’ve concluded it’s high time for some loosening of the rules that restrict how much media any one mogul can control. Australia’s looming contribution to the current global policy thought is to show that it, too, is big enough to tolerate some ownership consolidation. It 2 ̆ 7 s not entirely clear why. The domestic restrictions that are argued to have cramped the global ambitions of Australia’s restless mini-moguls don’t seem to have kept Rupert Murdoch at home, or Britain’s Daily Mail Group (which owns about a third of the country’s commercial radio stations) or Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s Singtel (which controls Optus) away. Cross-media limits do not seem to have stopped Big Brother integrating elements of television, radio, print, mobile telephony, and the web, or Fairfax, owner of the Age, incorporating audio and video into its online activities. Activities and services can be creatively converged without also converging ownership. The internet has greatly increased access to different viewpoints, a fact strikingly demonstrated during the Iraq war. But that is a positive and exciting thing, long overdue in Australia’s already concentrated media market place, not a reason to throw in the towel on diversity of control of the still-most-used media forms - free-to-air television, radio and daily newspapers. What is truly bewildering is that Australia’s four independent senators, whose votes would be enough to get the new laws over the line, appear to be considering various deals on the issue. Of course, media proprietors are persuasive people. But we need to be cautious before believing everything they tell us, even about what will serve their own interests - much less the public interest. The last time Australia had a big change in its media ownership rules, when the cross-media rules were passed in 1987 and just about every media asset in the country changed hands at absurd prices, the television and radio industries were plunged into debt-ridden catastrophe. That Hawke government legislation got through the Senate with the support of rogue Queensland National Party senators who split from the federal party as premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen launched his ‘Joh for PM’ campaign. The trivial concessions they extracted from the government have long since disappeared into history. What they got, for all its flaws, was legislation that trebled the number of commercial TV services in major regional markets in the eastern states, and ensured that different people would control the major media outlets in any area. What the legislation now before Parliament offers is no wholly new services, but the opportunity for consolidation of ownership of existing services. The one certain result is that, if it were to pass, there would soon be fewer owners of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s media enterprises. It 2 ̆ 7 s a recipe for increased media concentration, pure and simple.

[...] To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a DAT machine, and a <b>synchroniser.</b> The focus on capturing the band's material and encouraging the best performances meant that little {{attention was paid to}} combating audio spill.

U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed; he pointed at chords and various commands, such as [...] "hold", [...] "stop", [...] "change", and [...] "change back", to direct their performances.

Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers' sounds as much as possible.|$|E
