40|$|The High Energy Astronomy Observatory - Mission B (HEAO-B) is a {{satellite}} observatory {{for the purpose}} of performing a detailed X-ray survey of the celestial sphere. Measurements will be made of stellar radiation in the range of 0. 2 to 20 keV. The central part of the Observatory is an X-ray telescope, into the focus of which a variety of imaging instruments and spectrographs may be introduced. The telescope has a resolution of about 1 arc second, so that the instruments must be placed with extreme precision. This is obtained by a mechanical system of toggles and stops and a motor drive system controlled by a position <b>sensing</b> <b>potentiometer</b> with a resolution of about 1. 5 degree...|$|E
50|$|The robot has 23 active {{degrees of}} freedom. It {{is powered by}} Maxon DC motors rated at 20 Watts, 90 Watts and 150 Watts. Link orientations are <b>sensed</b> by <b>potentiometers,</b> which are {{attached}} to the link shafts and magnetic encoders, which {{are attached to the}} motor shafts.|$|R
50|$|The very {{simplest}} servomotors use position-only <b>sensing</b> via a <b>potentiometer</b> and bang-bang {{control of}} their motor; the motor always rotates at full speed (or is stopped). This type of servomotor is not widely used in industrial motion control, but it forms {{the basis of the}} simple and cheap servos used for radio-controlled models.|$|R

The human hand tracking system is a wearable <b>sensing</b> arm (<b>potentiometers)</b> {{used to determine the}} position in space and to sense the grasping task of human hand. The maskable sensing arm was designed with same geometrical arrangement of robotic hand that needs to be controlled. The control software of a robot was implemented using Visual Basic and supported with graphical user interface (GUI). The control algorithm depends on joint to joint mapping method to match between the motions at each joint of portable sensing arm with corresponding joint of a robot {{in order to make the}} robot mimic the motion...|$|R
40|$|A load {{positioning}} system with gravity compensation has a servomotor, position <b>sensing</b> feedback <b>potentiometer</b> and velocity <b>sensing</b> tachometer {{in a conventional}} closed loop servo arrangement to cause a lead screw and a ball nut to vertically position a load. Gravity compensating components comprise the DC motor, gears, which couple torque from the motor to the lead screw, and constant current power supply. The constant weight of the load applied to the lead screw via the ball nut tend to cause the lead screw to rotate, the constant torque of which is opposed by the constant torque produced by the motor when fed from the constant current source. The constant current is preset {{as required by the}} potentiometer to effect equilibration of the load which thereby enables the positioning servomotor to see the load as weightless under both static and dynamic conditions. Positioning acceleration and velocity performance are therefore symmetrical...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the complete development {{and analysis of}} a soft robotic platform that exhibits peristaltic locomo-tion. The design principle {{is based on the}} antagonistic arrange-ment of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference. An en-hanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes the com-bination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a func-tion of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and com-pared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Propriocep-tive <b>potentiometers</b> <b>sense</b> segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers. Several appropriate con-trol algorithms are designed and experimentally compared based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechan-ical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources. 1 Index Terms—Bioinspired robotics, earthworm robot, nickel titanium (NiTi) coil springs, peristaltic locomotion, soft robotics, shape memory alloy (SMA) actuation.

40|$|II+ in VHDL {{to run on}} an Altera DE 2 FPGA board. The point, {{aside from}} entertainment, was to {{illustrate}} the power (or rather, low power) of modern FPGAs. Put another way, what made Steve Jobs his first million could be a class project for the embedded systems class I teach at Columbia University. More seriously, this project demonstrates how legacy digital electronics can be preserved and integrated with modern systems. While I didn’t have an Apple II+ playing {{an important role in}} a system, many embedded systems last far longer than their technology. The space shuttle immediately comes to mind; PDP- 8 s can be found running some signs for San Francisco’s BART system. What is an Apple II+? The Apple II+ (Photo 1) {{was one of the first}} really successful personal computers. Designed by Steve Wozniak (“Woz”) and introduced in 1977 [1, 2, 4], it really took off in 1978 when the 140 K Disk II 5. 25 -inch floppy drive was introduced, followed by VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet. Fairly simple even by the standards of the day, the Apple II was built around the inexpensive 8 -bit 6502 processor from Photo 1 : An Apple II+ MOS Technology (it sold for $ 25 when an Intel 8080 sold for $ 179). The 6502 had an eight-bit data bus and a 64 K address space. In the Apple II+, the 6502 ran at slightly above 1 MHz. Aside from the ROMs and DRAMs, the rest of the circuitry consisted of discrete LS TTL chips (Photo 2). While the first Apple IIs shipped with 4 K of DRAM, this quickly grew to a standard of 48 K. DRAMs, at this time, were cutting-edge technology. While they required periodic refresh and three power supplies, their six-times higher density made them worthwhile. Along with with an integrated keyboard, a rudimentary (one-bit) sound port, and a game port that could <b>sense</b> buttons and <b>potentiometers</b> (e. g., in a joystick), the main feature of an Apple II+ was its integrated video display. It generated composite (baseband) NTSC video that was usually sent through an RF modulator to appear on TV channel 3 or 4. The Apple II+ had three video modes: a 40 × 24 uppercase-only black-and-white text display, a 40 × 48 16 -color low-resolution display, and...|$|R
