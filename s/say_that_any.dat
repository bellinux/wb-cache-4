25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E
25|$|By now, polyhedra were firmly {{understood}} as three-dimensional examples of more general polytopes {{in any number}} of dimensions. The second half of the century saw the development of abstract algebraic ideas such as Polyhedral combinatorics, culminating in the idea of an abstract polytope as a partially ordered set (poset) of elements. The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the null polytope or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or realised as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or faithful realisations, others do not. A flag is a connected set of elements of each dimension - for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be regular if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags - that is to <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.|$|E
500|$|Because Sherwood Anderson was so {{ambiguous}} {{about what}} directly influenced him, {{it is difficult}} to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> specific writer or work inspired him to write Winesburg, Ohio as a whole.

Though B.W. Huebsch, Anderson's publisher, sent out a statement, upon the release of Winesburg, Ohio, heading off comparisons between the two works by stating (erroneously, as it turns out) that the Winesburg stories were printed in magazines before the Spoon River Anthology was published, the similarities in small-town setting, structure, and mood of the works have been noted by several reviewers, with one {{going so far as to}} call Winesburg, Ohio, the Spoon River Anthology [...] "...put into prose." ...|$|E
