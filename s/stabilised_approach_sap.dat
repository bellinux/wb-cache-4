40|$|AbstractSingle {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) are {{one type}} of genomic DNA variations in a population. Correspondingly, single amino-acid polymorphisms (SAPs) derived from non-synonymous SNPs represent protein variations in a population. Recently, using proteomic <b>approaches,</b> <b>SAPs</b> in the plasma proteomes of an Asian population were systematically identified for the first time. That study showed that heterozygous and homozygous proteins with various SAPs have different associations with particular traits in the population. Recent discoveries of widespread differences between RNA and DNA sequences indicate that RNA editing is also a source of SAPs – one that is independent of genomic SNPs. Furthermore, we argue that there are de novo SAPs that are not encoded by either DNA or RNA sequences...|$|R

However, the multivariate kernel classifier suffers from the curse of dimensionality, requiring inordinately large sample sizes to achieve a reasonable degree of accuracy in high dimensional settings. A variance <b>stabilising</b> <b>approach</b> to kernel classification can be motivated through an alternative interpretation of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis in which rotations of the coordinate axes are employed to obtain an assumed mutual independence among the components of the rotated data. This alternative method, which we call the method of kernel product estimators, performs well in a variety of examples, including a 20 -dimensional target recognition problem.

5000|$|CDP is an {{important}} aspect of managing value chains. Generally, the first step of CDP is to forecast product demand. A manager can plan resource deployment in accordance with the resulting forecasts. It's a bottom-up approach vs. top down planning.

There are various software systems created by companies such as Dynasys, Avercast, Demand Solutions, RightChain TM, SAS System, Agentrics, Manugistics, Oracle, Petrolsoft Corporation (now Aspen Technology), StatSoft, ToolsGroup and GMDH Shell that are designed to forecast demand and plan operations.

Experimental research was done in a mature mixed fir-spruce-beech stand in the research plot “Poľana-Hukavský grúň” (850 m a. s. l.) in the south-eastern part of Poľana Mts. in the Biosphere Reserve UNESCO in Central Slovakia. Individual parameters of water budget have been continuously monitored. The water consumption of the model beech trees, as well as approximate model beech stand transpiration was estimated {{on the basis of}} sap flow measurements and up-scaling through dendrometrical <b>approach.</b> <b>Sap</b> flow of model beech trees was estimated by direct, non-destructive and continuous measure-ments by tree-trunk heat balance method with internal heating and sensing of temperature. These values were compared with potential evapotranspiration according to Türc. Precipitation parameters (rain and snow precipitation, through-fall precipitation, stem-flow, fog/snow precipitation and infiltration) have been measured simultaneously. Results of mass water balance and the portion of the tree transpiration within the individual water flows are presented. Evapotranspiration of beech-fir forest ecosystem in the middle mountain region (850 m a. s. l.) includes: transpiration (35 % of precipitation total), interception (21 %), evaporation (8 %). There are differences between tree species in mass of transpirated water. Transpi-ration of spruce and fir reaches two-thirds of beech transpiration. Fog precipitation contribution to the water balance of beech-fir stand is 5 %. Concurrently fog precipitation lowers the interception losses of vertical precipitation...|$|R

The SQL standard specifies how to call exter-nal stored routines implemented in programming languages, such as C, C++, or JAVA, to complement declarative SQL-based application logic. This is beneficial for scientific and analytical algorithms {{because they are}} usually too complex to be implemented entirely in SQL. At the same time, data-base applications like matrix calculations or data mining al-gorithms benefit from multi-threading to parallelize compute-intensive operations. Multi-threaded application code, how-ever, introduces a resource competition between the threads of applications and the threads of the database task sched-uler. In this paper, we show that multi-threaded application code can render the database’s workload scheduling ineffec-tive and decrease the core throughput of the database by up to 50 %.

The qualitative research revealed that even though a combination of forces for change (in the realm of discourses, actors, resources and rules) is present, their influence is partly neutralised by forces for stability. These forces for stability became incrementally and iteratively more and more institutionalised and mutually reinforced each other, thus <b>stabilising</b> the defence <b>approach.</b> As a consequence, FRM is path dependent, i. e. the development of alternative FRM approaches may be influenced by the dominant defence approach.

Surgical techniques to date have usually been by posterior approach and lateral dissection around the cord or via midline myelotomy, both approaches involving cord manipulation and retraction and in the latter, dissection through the spinal cord. We present two teenage patients with symptomatic anteriorly placed mid to high cervical spinal AVMs and associated aneurysm in which excision of the AVMs and aneurysm was performed by an anterior approach using vertebrectomy/corpectomy. The first case had a small perimedullary glomus-type AVM with an aneurysm on the anterior aspect of the cord at the C 3 / 4 level; excision was performed using a single level vertebrectomy/corpectomy, the patient remaining neurologically intact. The second case had a medium-sized juvenile AVM with an aneurysm, both perimedullary and intramedullary, centred at the C 5 / 6 level; excision was performed using a two-level vertebrectomy/corpectomy with no deterioration in the marked pre-operative tetraparesis, which at long-term follow up had improved and <b>stabilised.</b> Anterior <b>approaches</b> have been recently described for treatment of anteriorly placed cervical arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and an intramedullary haemangioblastoma, but not as yet for spinal AVMs. These are the first two reported cases of anteriorly situated cervical AVMs successfully removed surgically by an anterior approach and with good neurological outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many {{companies}} use {{business process}} modeling to support various improvements initiatives {{leading to an}} increasing number of pro-cess models. Typically, these models are stored in a collection containing several hundreds of process models. In many cases, process models are overlapping, although parts could be easily reused saving costs and efforts. Different labeling styles and evolving process models complicate the detec-tion of reusable model parts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the detection of equivalent and similar process model parts that ex-ploits semantic comparison of activity labels and behavioral comparison of control flow. We evaluate our <b>approach</b> on the <b>SAP</b> Reference Model, a collection with 604 process models. The evaluation reveals insights for the thresholds of semantic and behavioral similarity of process models as well as their influence for similar process part detection. Hence, we identify five candidate groups with specific similarity properties that contain reoccurring process parts. ...|$|R

We also point out that the issue of the cosmological constant cancellation in the post-inflationary vacuum strongly affects supersymmetric inflation. It is important to note the crucial difference between the freezing of the modulus and actually <b>stabilising</b> it—the first <b>approach</b> misses parts of the scalar potential which turn out to be relevant for inflation.

Since no model of trajectory is considered, the approach is robust to wide motions of object and camera. The relevance of this approach has been evaluated on several video streams. Results obtained with the most representative of them are presented in this paper. The algorithms involved have been implemented {{with the aim of}} achieving near real-time performance. ...|$|R
