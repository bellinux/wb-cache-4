40|$|The common {{marketing}} practice of offering subscribers enticements to switch suppliers is explored. It is shown {{that this type}} of price discrimination is the natural mode of competition in <b>subscription</b> <b>markets</b> such as long distance telephony and banking and that it prevails even when the industry in question is fully competitive and all firms earn zero economic profit. In addition, while price discrimination in monopolistic markets generally enhances efficiency, the type of price discrimination here undermines it because subscribers are induced to spend time and effort changing suppliers. A multi-period model in which each consumer's cost of switching varies randomly over time is studied. In equilibrium, firms set prices that do not depend on market shares or time, and consumers follow a reservation-cost rule which leads them to switch suppliers in 'slack' periods and not to switch in 'busy' ones. <b>Subscription</b> <b>markets</b> are shown to be fully competitive only when three or more firms serve the industry. In this case, the price offered to switchers is actually below cost, while non-switchers pay a premium. A firm, thus, earns positive rent on its base of current customers, but zero expected profit on each new subscriber it attracts. When firms can track consumer behavior over time, an individual may change suppliers in order to establish a reputation as a switcher, thereby securing better future price offers. ...|$|R

40|$|Of all the {{stakeholders}} {{professional sports}} teams must satisfy, it is sports fans that are {{arguably the most}} important. The value of fans stems from {{the wide range of}} direct connections or associations they form with teams, which include social, emotional and financial exchanges. All teams need fans as a basic requirement for survival, but an active and engaged fan -base provides direct revenue through ticket sales and merchandise purchase and indirect benefits such as increasing broadcast rights values. Fans also create a range of media and sponsorship opportunities for sporting organizations to leverage, through their numbers and loyalty to the team. Fans of a team can include those who "silently" support the team without attending games, those who choose to attend individual home games on a casual basis, and those who acquire team memberships or season tickets that offer a service commonly inclusive of home match attendance and other various benefits. Season ticket holders (SIH hereafter) can be viewed as the first among equals, as their repeat patronage and higher commitment makes them, in many ways, the most desirable of all customers. Customer management is always a complex blend of understanding what a customer requires and delivering it profitably, in the right way at the right time. STH management is even more complex, particularly in a sports context. STH management is complicated, as season -ticket products constitute a <b>subscription</b> <b>market,</b> where purchase decisions are made infrequently (typically annually) and evaluations are usually a result of a combination of experiences over time. Customer behaviour in <b>subscription</b> <b>market</b> situations is also very different from in repertoire or casual ticket buying markets. Added to the complexity of subscription markets is the fact that most STH are drawn from the ranks of the most passionate sports fans. Their passion can make them demanding customers, requiring personalized attention that is difficult to deliver en masse. STH make a significant financial and emotional commitment to sports teams and require careful management in return to ensure their satisfaction and continued patronage. This chapter examines the particular requirements of STH, from understanding how to attract and retain STH through to what managers can do to ensure their satisfaction...|$|E

Currently online news sites have greatly satisfied the expectations of the readers, and there has been a decrease in the circulation of print newspapers. This study examines the consumer choice of print and online media with respect to demographics and preference of format. The study adopted a primary quantitative data collection approach wherein a paper based survey of 102 journalists was carried out. This research paper inspected the impact of the variables involved (online media and print media) on each other as well as the cause-effect relationship between them. It also highlighted the two main categories of input — descriptive research and explorative research. To tabulate results of the former, the qualitative data that had been collected (after conducting the Elite and Specialized Interview, and the Focus Group Interview). These three facets were then examined simultaneously on the basis of certain hypotheses made, which were fittingly measured with the help of the Chi-Square (or the Null Hypothesis) test. It was concluded that there is no association between the type of media and personal attributes. Large majority of the respondents, irrespective of their gender, nationality, age, education and income, prefer online media, particularly, internet. The only exception is the senior citizen with age above 50 years, still prefer to go with the print media, specifically, newspapers. It confirms that there is no statistically significant association between reasons and the preference for the type of media. It means that according to the type of media, the reasons do not vary significantly. It can empirically conclude that online media affects print media. Impact of online media on print media happens on the various aspects of print media viz. demand, <b>subscription,</b> <b>market</b> share, print revenue, advertising revenue and profitability...|$|E
40|$|Understanding brand {{switching}} {{is important}} to marketers because a brand switch {{has the potential to}} impact on an organisation's share of a customer's wallet. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine what the impacts, of the antecedents to a brand switch, will be on the construction of a purchase repertoire and consideration set in a <b>subscription</b> <b>market.</b> This study, into the new area of post-switch consideration set construction, and the position of the previous main brand, shows that the construction of a consumer's consideration set is dependent on the reasons for the brand switch. Whilst consumers switch brands for a multitude of reasons, the literature shows these reasons can effectively be grouped together into three categories: stochastic reasons, expectation disconfirmation, and utility maximisation. This research confirms that where a switch occurred for stochastic reasons, the previous main brand would remain in the consumer's consideration set with the same purchase probabilities for a brand of its size. On the other hand, where the brand switch occurred for reasons of expectation disconfirmation, the previous main brand was either removed entirely from the consumer's consideration set, or if it remained in the set, had a lower ranking than prior to the switch. While a brand switch that occurred for reasons of utility maximisation resulted in a majority of the previous main brands being removed from the consumer's consideration set, those that remained were ranked one place lower than the current main brand. Overall these results supported the research's general direction that the antecedents to a brand switch will affect the previous main brand's position in a consumer's post-switch purchase repertoire and consideration set. The research concludes, while the previous main brand may be gone, it is certainly not forgotten! These findings, while being exploratory and inductive, have important implications for marketers in both their recovery marketing campaigns and the need to implement programmes to retain recent acquisitions. Coupled with the findings from Sharp et al. (2002) this study shows that subscription markets, in terms of switching, behave in a similar manner to repertoire markets, allowing for stochastic models to be used to benchmark marketing activities...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays that investigate dynamic pricing and bundling strategies in <b>subscription</b> <b>markets.</b> In the first essay, we analyze the dynamic price discrimination strategies of a monopolist offering new services on a subscription basis. In <b>subscription</b> <b>markets,</b> the pricing policy can be based on customers’ past purchase behavior (behavioral price discrimination) and time of purchase (intertemporal price discrimination). In the presence of uncertainty regarding the value of new features and heterogeneity in consumer valuations of the existing features, we investigate the profits and rate of adoption of new technology {{that can be achieved}} with each pricing strategy. When the prior heterogeneity in consumer valuation of the existing features is relatively large, the monopolist can improve his profits by committing to ignore consumer past behavior and varying prices based only on time. We also study the role of commitment power of the monopolist to announce future prices and correlation in valuations of the new and existing features. In the second essay, we investigate the multi-product pricing strategies of a sequentially innovating monopolist introducing new services. The new service can either represent a new functionality not directly related to the existing service or an enhancement to the existing services. When the existing service is offered in multiple versions, the monopolist can sell the new service separately or bundle the new service with some or all versions of the primary service. We analyze two pricing strategies that represent the two extremes of a spectrum of bundling strategies that a monopolist offering such services can practice: Discriminative Bundling (DB) and Independent Pricing (IP). Using the discriminative bundling (DB) strategy, a service provider offering multiple versions of the primary service bundles the new service only with higher versions of the primary service while selling it separately to remaining customers. Using the independent pricing strategy (IP), the service provider offers the new service separately to all consumers including those buying lower and higher end versions. We find that the comparison of the two strategies in terms of profits depends {{on the nature of the}} new service and the general distribution of consumer valuations for the new and the primary services. ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim of this thesis is to clarify the link between consumer memory and brand choice, which is a seminal assumption of prominent marketing theories and brand management practises, such as Customer Based Brand Equity (CBBE; Keller, 1993, 2003). The aim is important for two reasons: (i) recent evidence has questioned the precise nature of the link (e. g., Stocchi et al., 2015), thus potentially challenging a long-standing body of CBBE research; and (ii) up-to-date efforts in CBBE research have shifted towards linking the two aspects (memory and choice) to conceptualise CBBE as a process (e. g., Christodoulides et al., 2015; Grohs et al., 2016), but how exactly this can happen {{is still in its}} infancy (Stocchi and Fuller, 2017). The aim is addressed with two objectives. The first objective is to develop a new framework that conceptualises and operationalises the link between consumer memory and brand choice. This is reinforced with the second objective, which uses the framework to examine the link in, and across, two different markets (repertoire and subscription markets; see Sharp et al., 2002). Importantly, the second objective addresses an additional problem of theoretical and practical relevance, which is a bias of CBBE research in goods markets (Christodoulides and de Chernatony, 2009) and an absence of comparative research across markets. This problem is worth addressing given the growing prevalence of non-goods offerings (Ostrom et al., 2014). The development of the new framework derives from the clarification and integration of two established research streams: brand retrieval research, which offers insight into the cognitive processes involved in the link between consumer memory and brand choice, and hierarchical models of brand choice, which detail the stages that brands move through in memory before choice. Specifically, the new framework provides a theoretically robust and multi-level examination of how consumers narrow down brands for choice in memory, which includes: (i) brand retrieval propensity (i. e., the likelihood to think of a brand(s) in purchase occasions; Romaniuk, 2013); (ii) the stages involved in the brand choice process, including the extent to which consumers narrow down brands between the stages; (iii) the relationship between brand retrieval and brand choice; and (iv) a feedback loop controlling for the impact of prior brand usage. The operationalization of the new framework is based on existing and new measures, thereby delivering some methodological advancements. The data used to examine the link between consumer memory and brand choice in and across markets derives from a large-scale UK consumer survey (N= 771) capturing brand usage, brand awareness and brand image data for soft drinks (a proxy for repertoire markets) and banking (a proxy for subscription markets), from the same consumers, over three time periods. These tightly controlled variables support a robust comparison of the link across markets, which is facilitated further with the employment of a suite of empirical tools, including mean absolute deviations (MADs), correlations, ANOVAs and multiple linear regression. The thesis offers several theoretical contributions. Firstly, by clarifying the link between consumer memory and brand choice, the new framework addresses concerns over the validity of the link (Stocchi et al., 2015) and clarifies how CBBE can be conceptualized and measured as a process (Christodoulides et al., 2015). Moreover, the results of the thesis showed that the link between consumer memory and brand choice differs across markets, specifically: (i) consumers find it easier to think of <b>subscription</b> <b>market</b> brands in purchase occasions; (ii) <b>subscription</b> <b>market</b> brands face fiercer competition at the early stages of the brand choice process vs. the later stages for repertoire market brands; and (iii) consumers draw on memorized brand information to a greater extent when purchasing in subscription markets. These insights contribute to brand loyalty literature, where they offer a first simultaneous examination of the cognitive origins of loyalty (i. e., across multiple stages); and challenge Service Dominant Logic (SDL), where they reinforce the need to recognize differences between markets. Furthermore, the results offer novel insights for brand retrieval research by illustrating that such differences may originate, at least in part, from the prevalence of different pathways to brand retrieval, most notably recollection (the retrieval of experiential brand information). Managerially, the framework provides an advanced brand management tool that features key performance metrics related to brand choice, and advice for managers of how to build them. For instance, from the results in this thesis, the advice to managers in subscription markets is to build and reinforce attribute-to-brand cues in memory, and links from the brand to the category; whilst managers in repertoire markets should focus on building and reinforcing reasons to buy...|$|E

40|$|Losing {{customers}} to another bank tends to worry bank executives. Understanding {{the reasons why}} customers switch banks helps these executives plan their customer retention (including customer recovery) and customer acquisition strategies. This paper improves our understanding of switching by applying a categorisation of switching behaviour observed in repertoire <b>markets</b> to <b>subscription</b> <b>markets.</b> This allows us to make predictions {{about the content of}} customers' post-switch brand repertoires, or consideration sets. We test our predictions with a large commercial data set and find that switching antecedents pertaining to utility maximisation ('moving for a better offer') and expectation disconfirmation (usually service failures) confirm previous research findings. We, however, make the new discovery that stochastic reasons (those beyond the bank's control) account for a considerable amount of switching and lead to greater post-switch consideration. Our study shows that construction of customers' post-switch consideration sets is therefore antecedent specific, and concludes that while the previous main bank brand may have been forsaken, it is certainly not forgotten. Enough goodwill for the previous main bank brand resides in these results to warrant bank executives reconsidering their customer-recapture strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mainstream}} of marketing {{time series analysis}} has shifted from classical short-range dependence (ARMA, transfer functions and VAR models). However, in cases where purchase decisions entail some commitment (e. g., a subscription selling periodic use of a product or service), sales response entails a long-term effect is not permanent. Long-memory assumes that shocks to a time series have neither a persistent nor a short-run transitory effect, but that they last {{for a long time}} and decay slowly with time. Many marketing policies face a short-memory response at the individual customer level but display a considerable degree of persistence at the aggregate level. The aggregation of short-run individual decisions made by heterogeneous customers can show a long-memory pattern.

40|$|Analysis {{of brand}} {{performance}} {{based on the}} relationship between brand size and consumer choice behaviour is a common procedure for repertoire and <b>subscription</b> <b>markets.</b> The more popular a brand (the more customers it has), the more often those customers tend to buy it. Thus, loyalty (repeat purchase) is a function of brand size as captured by the Dirichlet model and the Double Jeopardy Law. The law-like relationship between brand size and repeat buying has been shown to hold for large brands—the top ten or even twenty brands in a category. But little work has been done to analyse whether the same rules apply for smaller brands, yet, this is important since small brands by far outnumber their larger opponents in any category. This paper documents and quantifies negative deviations from the Double Jeopardy line for low market share brands in 35 UK FMCG categories consisting of 430 brands and 37 ‘others’.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{defection}} has been examined primarily in a transactional context {{as opposed to}} <b>subscription</b> <b>markets</b> where the infrequent nature of the purchase or renewal means that retention of subscribers is often both more difficult and more crucial. This paper reports on a survey that aimed to uncover {{more information about the}} motivations and future intentions of recently lapsed subscribers. 1, 011 lapsed members across four Australian Football League (AFL) clubs and one Australian National Rugby League (NRL) club were surveyed. Analysis of the responses returned suggests that although these lapsed members report that they joined to financially support and feel more involved with the club, they let their membership lapse primarily due to an inability to attend games. Despite joining for intangible, altruistic reasons, it seems that if these members could not get to games, they believed that the membership was not worth maintaining. These members were satisfied with the membership; however measures of overall level of satisfaction had only a weak positive relationship with the likelihood of members rejoining in the future. The inconsistencies in the findings challenge some conventional approaches to both the methods of researching lapsed members and the theories that are frequently used to explain behaviours. We find that simplistic entry or exit surveys are likely to be of limited value in subscription defection research and that satisfaction is unlikely to be a strong predictor of defection behaviour. <br /...|$|R
