40|$|Sensor {{applications}} in Sensoria [1] are expressed using STEP (Sensorium Task Execution Plan). SNAFU (Sensor-Net Applications as Functional Units) {{serves as a}} high-level sensor-programming language, which is compiled into STEP. In SNAFU’s current form, its differences with STEP are relatively minor, as they are limited to shorthands and macros not available in STEP. We show that, however restrictive it may seem, SNAFU has in fact universal power; technically, it is a Turing-complete language, i. e., any Turing program can be written in SNAFU (though not always conveniently). Although STEP may {{be allowed to have}} universal power, as a low-level language not directly available to Sensorium users, SNAFU programmers may use this power for malicious purposes or inadvertently introduce errors with destructive consequences. In future developments of SNAFU, we plan to introduce restrictions and highlevel features with <b>safety</b> <b>guards,</b> such as those provided by a type system, which will make SNAFU programming safer. ...|$|E

It is well known fact that {{in every aspect of}} health care {{activity}} more than one kind of hazardous, obnoxious, contagiouns materials are being generated. Thousands of tonnes of biomedical wastes originating from hospitals, nursing homes and clinics in the form of cotton swabs and bandages infected with blood, needles, catheters, human tissues and body parts etc., continue to be dumped in open garbage bins on the roads and open spaces. Barring a few large private hospitals, none of the smaller hospitals and nursing homes have any effective system to safely dispose their wastes. The attitude of the government and municipal hospitals is no better than these private health care units. Though extensive studies have been carried out about the hospital waste management in urban areas, studies pertinent to the same in rural areas are very meagre. The present investigation on hospital waste management in Hunsur Taluk of Mysore district is aimed at filling this lacuna in our knowledge of hospital waste. The investigation carried out in Hunsur revealed that burning of wastes in open spaces method being followed in a few hospitals. Many hospital administration staff do not have knowledge of health care waste and its management. There is no <b>safety</b> <b>guards</b> for sweepers during inspection or operation of the wastes. None of the hospitals is having incinerator. Nobody has given any formal training in waste management. All the hospitals claimed that there are no radioactive wastes. Based on the above results and investigations, an action plan for health care waste management has been formulated for the better health and living of rural people...|$|E
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 24 - 07 - 2015 Coronavirus	 such	 as	 the	 severe	 acute	 respiratory	 syndrome	 coronavirus	 (SARSCoV) and	the	Middle	East	respiratory	syndome	virus	(MERS-CoV) 	cause	high	case	 fatality	rates	and	remain	as	major	human	public	health	threats. 	No	specific	therapy	 for	 any	 human	 coronavirus	is	 available,	making	 vaccine	 development	 critical	 for	 protection	 against	 these	 viruses. 	 Previously,	 we	 demonstrated	 that	 a	 mouseadapted SARS-CoV	 (SARS-CoV-MA 15) 	 lacking	 the	 envelope	 (E) 	 protein	 (rSARSCoV-MA 15 -ΔE) is	 attenuated	 in	 vivo. 	 To	 identify	 E	 protein	 regions	 and	 host	 responses	 that	 contribute	 to	 rSARS-CoV-MA 15 -ΔE	 attenuation,	 several	 mutants	 (rSARS-CoV-MA 15 -E*) 	 containing	 point	 mutations	 or	 deletions	 in	 the	 aminoterminal or	 the	 carboxy-terminal	 regions	 of	 the	 E	 protein	 were	 generated. 	 We	 showed	 that	 small	 deletions	 and	 modifications	 within	 E	 protein	 led	 to	 virus	 attenuation,	 causing	 minimal	 lung	 injury,	 limited	 neutrophil	 influx	 to	 the	 lungs,	 reduced	 expression	 of	 proinflammatory	 cytokines,	 increased	 anti-inflammatory	 cytokine	 levels,	 and	 enhanced	 CD 4 + and	 CD 8 + T	 cell	 counts	 in	 vivo. 	 These	 data	 suggests	 that	 the	 described	 mutant	 phenotype	 contributed	 to	 virus	 attenuation. 	 The	attenuated	mutants	fully	protected	mice	from	challenge	with	virulent	virus. 	A	 major	 problem	 of	 using	 live	 attenuated	 viruses	 as	 vaccines	 is	 the	 possibility	 of	 reversion	 to	 virulence. 	 To	 overcome	 this	 limitation,	 we	 introduced	 additional	 attenuating	mutations	into	the	nsp 1 	protein	to	generate	a	safer	vaccine	candidate. 	 Nsp 1 	gene	was	selected	as	a	target	because	it	is	located	at	a	distal	position	(> 20 kb) 	 from	that	of	E	gene	in	the	viral	genome,	making	the	generation	of	a	virulent	virus through	 a	 single	 recombination	 event	 with	 circulating	 coronaviruses	 highly	 unlikely. 	 To	 identify	 nsp 1 	 protein	 regions	 that	 contribute	 to rSARS-CoV-MA 15 	 attenuation,	several	mutants	(rSARS-CoV-MA 15 -nsp 1 *) 	containing	small	deletions	 in	 of	 the	 nsp 1 	 protein	 were	 generated. 	 Deletion	 of	 121 	 to	 129 	 and	 154 	 to	 165 	 aminoacids	in	the	carboxy	terminal	region	of	nsp 1 	protein	led	to	virus	attenuation. 	 Immunization	 with	 single	 SARS-CoV	 mutants	 protected	 mice	 against	 challenge	 with	the	lethal	parental	virus. 	A	recombinat	virus	including	<b>safety</b>	<b>guards</b>	in	E	and	 nsp 1 	genes	was	generated. 	This	mutant	virus	was	in	general	genetically	stable	in	 vitro and	in	vivo,	completely	attenuated,	and	protected	mice	against	challenge	with	 the	lethal	parental	virus,	indicating	that	this	virus	is	promising	vaccine	candidate...|$|E
40|$|Several hundred {{accidents}} involving {{the use of}} circular saws and resulting in injury, to hands or fingers occur each year in Germany. In the presented project, new approaches {{for the prevention of}} hand injuries and for the contactless detection of fingers are being investigated for comprehensive protection on circular saws. The basic principles can be applied to other machines with manual loading and/or unloading. This paper describes several principles to distinct human skin and wood and a <b>safety</b> <b>guard</b> that prevents touching the rotating blade. In a first approach a reliable protective device with functional diversity has been developed using a passive infrared sensor in combination with a capacitive field sensor. Second the distinction between skin and wood or other material is done by dedicated kind of spectral analysis in the near infrared region. With a kind of light curtain the intrusion into the dangerous zone near the blade can be prevented. The <b>safety</b> <b>guard</b> protects the operator’s hand within 50 ms. The forces of the protective system peak at no more than 120 N.
