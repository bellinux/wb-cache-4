25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of very much at all. As early as the 14th century, cracks <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
25|$|By 1917, Hardrick's local {{reputation}} {{was such that}} he and William Edouard Scott were featured in the Tenth Annual Exhibition of Works by Indiana Artists at the Herron School of Art, both men receiving critical praise. By 1924, he and Hale Woodruff shared a studio at 542½ Indiana Avenue. Unfortunately, his financial situation was such that by 1925 he {{was working in the}} family trucking business and had started a carpet cleaning business to help support his family, but still found time to paint. Commenting on a 1927 exhibition at the Pettis Gallery in Indianapolis, one review commented that his work had <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> and mature in those two years. That same year he and Woodruff were among those featured at the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition of African-American artists. In addition, that year he received a $100 honorarium and second-place bronze medal from the Harmon Foundation. It was presented to him by mayor Ert Slack during a ceremony which honored the achievements of local African-Americans as part of the city's sixth annual Inter-Racial Sunday. This led to a fund drive to purchase one of his best-known paintings, Little Brown Girl.|$|E

25|$|After {{official}} approval, both islands {{embarked on}} programs {{to promote the}} language. A commission including Maduro and Jonis of previous commissions was appointed the task of publishing {{a new version of}} the Curaçaoan orthography, which appeared in 1983. While interest in the language <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow,</b> problems arose in Aruba. Rules seemed unclear and not comprehensive in certain areas. In 1992 this prompted the Minister of Welfare to name a commission with the purpose of clarification and reform of the Aruban orthography. The commission delivered its findings later that year. Three years later the Aruban government relayed these findings to a number of institutions for analysis and to gather input. In the course of a year, the Government collected the recommendations it had received and in 1997 the Ministry of Education and Labour named a second commission to analyse and incorporate the relevant annotations. Their findings were presented to the ministry later that year. It was near the end of 2006 when the Ministry of Education had inventarised all additional recommendations and the official version which takes these into account was published the next year.|$|E

"On us who {{saw these}} {{phenomenon}} {{for the first}} time the impression will not easily be forgotten...We felt necessarily carried back to a time when the schistus on which we stood was yet at the bottom of the sea, and when the sandstone before us was only beginning to be deposited, in the shape of sand or mud, from the waters of the supercontinent ocean... The mind <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> giddy by looking so far back into the abyss of time; and whilst we listened with earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and series of these wonderful events, we became sensible how much further reason may sometimes go than imagination may venture to follow."

2500|$|After Mexico {{successfully}} {{declared its}} independence of Spain in 1822, {{the potential for}} conflict <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> rather than subside. [...] Many Americans settled in Texas, including {{a large number of}} Arkansans. [...] The development of the Texas Revolution is closely linked to this state since many Arkansans joined Stephen F. Austin's colony in Texas. [...] Also, Sam Houston spent much of his time in Washington, Arkansas where he planned the revolution and gathered supporters. [...] Additionally, many Arkansans volunteered for service in Houston's revolutionary army. Houston asked Arkansas volunteers to bring “a good rifle, and one hundred rounds of ammunition, and to come soon.” On December 1, 1835 the Gazette editor reported that “emigrants and fighting men, in considerable numbers, are passing through town, almost daily...” [...] With the successful conclusion of the Texas Revolution in 1836, a nine-year period of uneasy peace followed. [...] However, in 1845 the expansionist United States Congress admitted Texas to the Union. [...] War with Mexico followed immediately.|$|E

2500|$|In the Spring of 1788 he set {{off with}} John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more {{examples}} of this sequence in the valleys of the Tour and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath. They then took a boat trip from Dunglass Burn east along the coast with the geologist Sir James Hall of Dunglass. They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called [...] "a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea". Playfair later commented about the experience, [...] "the mind <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time". Continuing along the coast, they made more discoveries including sections of the vertical beds showing strong ripple marks which gave Hutton [...] "great satisfaction" [...] as a confirmation of his supposition that these beds had been laid horizontally in water. He also found conglomerate at altitudes that demonstrated the extent of erosion of the strata, and said of this that [...] "we never should have dreamed of meeting with what we now perceived".|$|E
