These ice vinyls are played live during the short time that the ever-changing characteristic of the disc allows the process, in which the surface with the grooves turning to liquid, disappearing the sound recordings and emerging noise and experimentation. This time depends and is related to the climate and the space conditions: temperature, humidity, wind; being the reason why it varies in each live act. Ice vinyls are made with molds that contain the negative information of the original disc grooves. Water is spilled on these molds and they are put away to freeze the necessary time to obtain <b>solid</b> <b>copies.</b> In front of the public the disc is separated from the mold and played.|$|R

A tetraalkyne-functionalized glucose derivative and lipidated Fmoc-lysine were prepared by novel efficient and convenient syntheses.

The charts are essentially complete through the 59 -stem. We {{believe that these}} are the most accurate and extensive charts of their kind. We also include a motivic Adams-Novikov E ∞ chart. This document contains large-format Adams-Novikov charts that compute the classical 2 -complete stable homotopy groups. The charts are essentially complete through the 59 -stem. We believe {{that these are the}} most accurate and extensive charts of their kind. We also include a motivic Adams-Novikov E ∞ chart. The charts are intended to be viewed electronically. The author can supply versions that are suitable for printing. Justifications for these calculations appear in [1]. 1. The E 2 -page of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence This chart shows the E 2 -page of the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence through the 59 -stem, together with all differentials. Beyond the 47 -stem, there are some uncertainties, which are indicated on the chart. For legibility, the chart is split into two pieces. The well-understood α family and its α 1 multiples are depicted on a separate grid. The names of elements are essentially arbitrary and do not necessarily reflect structure. (1) <b>Solid</b> dots indicate <b>copies</b> of Z/ 2. (2) Open circles indicate copies of Z/ 4. (3) <b>Solid</b> squares indicate <b>copies</b> of Z/ 8. (4) Open squares indicate copies of Z/ 2 k for some k ≥ 4. The default value of k is 4, unless shown otherwise on the chart. The value k = ∞ indicates a copy of Z 2. (5) Lines of slope 1 indicate α 1 multiplications. (6) Arrows of slope 1 indicate infinitely many α 1 multiplications. (7) Lines of slope 1 / 3 indicate α 2 / 2 multiplications. (8) Magenta lines indicate that an extension equals 2 times a generator. For example, α 2 2 / 2 z 14 equals 2 z 20, 4 in the 20 -stem. (9) Orange lines indicate that an extension equals 4 times a generator. For example, α...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has suggested both links {{and differences between}} children's copying of line diagrams and their drawings of solid objects. If the diagram represents a familiar object, children make more errors than when copying a diagram of a nonobject or unfamiliar object, {{as if they are}} drawing from their representation of the object rather than copying the surface features of the diagram. However, copying a diagram yields fewer and different types of errors than drawing the equivalent solid, which suggests a different process. In Experiment 1 (n = 72), possible relations between copying and drawing are investigated by asking children to draw a solid cube, then to copy or trace a line diagram of the cube in oblique projection, and finally to draw the <b>solid</b> again. <b>Copying</b> was better than drawing, and there was positive transfer to a subsequent drawing. Tracing was very accurate, but transfer to drawing did not occur, possibly because of the automatic nature of tracing. In Experiment 2 (n = 120) different groups received versions of the copying task that differed in the extent to which temporal order of line copying was structured. Asking children to copy the lines in a systematic order led to improved copies, but this performance did not carry over to a subsequent drawing of the solid. In contrast, when temporal ordering of line copying was not manipulated, there was positive transfer from copying to the subsequent drawing. In Experiment 3 (n = 80), provision of structure that emphasized faces by color-groupings of lines or coloring faces led to improved copies and did not hinder transfer to drawing the solid. Experiment 4 (n = 90) showed that in a solid drawing task emphasis on faces but not edges produced a positive effect, both on the immediate drawing and on a subsequent drawing of a plain cube. We conclude that emphasis on order of line copying improves performance in a copying task because in that case line-to-line matching is an important element of the skill, whereas this does not aid drawing of the solid object, in which the focus is primarily on representation of faces and their interrelations...|$|R
