40|$|A {{high-power}} {{reversible converter}} can achieve {{a variety of}} functions, such as recovering regenerative braking energy, expanding traction power capacity, and improving an alternating current (AC) grid power factor. A new hybrid traction power supply scheme, which consists of a high-power reversible converter and two 12 -pulse diode rectifiers, is proposed. A droop control method based on load current feed-forward is adopted to realize the load distribution between the reversible converter and the existing 12 -pulse diode rectifiers. The direct current (DC) <b>short-circuit</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the reversible converter is studied, then {{the relationship between the}} peak fault current and the circuit parameters is obtained from theoretical calculations and validated by computer simulation. The first two sets of 2 MW reversible converters have been successfully applied in Beijing Metro Line 10, the proposed hybrid application scheme and coordinated control strategy are verified, and 11. 15 % of average energy-savings is reached...|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} research, BaTiO 3 films with thicknesses of 0.1 to 3.0 μm were fabricated on Cu substrates by an AD process {{at room temperature}} and compared with BaTiO 3 films on SUS substrates. As a result, all BaTiO 3 thin films with a thickness of less than 0.5 μm showed <b>short-circuit</b> <b>characteristics</b> owing to high leakage currents, and BaTiO 3 thin films of 0.5 to 1 μm in thickness had partial dielectric properties [11 – 13]. In addition, the BaTiO 3 thin films on Cu substrates exhibited rough interfaces between the films and the substrates as well as macroscopic defects such as pores and not-fully-crushed particles. On the other hand, the BaTiO 3 films on SUS substrates had a lower critical minimum thickness of 0.2 μm, a lower interface roughness, and a fewer macroscopic defects than the BaTiO 3 films on Cu substrates. From these results, we proposed that the rough interfaces and the macroscopic defects in the BaTiO 3 thin films with thicknesses of less than 0.5 μm on Cu substrates lead to high leakage currents [14].|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the safety}} spark test apparatus, the {{short-circuit}} spark discharge (SCSD) characteristics of the simple capacitive circuit and switching converter are studied. It is pointed out that their SCSD process {{can be divided into}} four stages, that is, dielectric-breakdown stage, spark-generated stage, spark-maintenance stage, and spark-extinguish stage; moreover, there is different equivalent spark resistance in each stage. For the simple capacitive circuit, its spark resistance is larger and maintaining voltage is almost unchanged in the spark-maintenance stage. For the switching converter, its output <b>short-circuit</b> <b>characteristics</b> depend strongly on the load resistance and its maintaining voltage reduces rapidly with the decrease of the load resistance. The circuit model is proposed, which can simulate the output SCSD process of the switching converter. By using the least-squares method, the relationship expressions between the discharge duration and capacitance in each time-stage are derived and the corresponding equivalent resistance is obtained. The mathematical models are established, and the expressions of the discharge current and voltage are deduced. Experiment and simulation results are positive in the analysis showing the feasibility of the proposed models...|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} research, {{to produce a}} high capacitance density, BaTiO 3 was deposited on Cu substrates by the AD process at room temperature, and the film thickness was reduced to confirm the critical minimum thickness for dielectric properties. Consequently, all BaTiO 3 thin films that were less than 0.5 -μm thick showed <b>short-circuit</b> <b>characteristics</b> owing to high leakage currents, while the BaTiO 3 thin films that were 0.5 - to 1 -μm thick had only partial dielectric properties, which was an obstacle in achieving a satisfactory thin film process using the AD process [11 – 13]. However, the BaTiO 3 films that were more than 1 -μm thick exhibited a dense morphology from which defects were markedly absent, which {{was considered to be}} due to the rigidity of the surfaces of the hard ceramic BaTiO 3 films. From the above consideration, in order to clarify the role of substrate hardness in growing the deposited films, BaTiO 3 films were fabricated on stainless steel (SUS) substrates which were harder than the Cu substrates. As a result, the BaTiO 3 films on SUS substrates had a lower critical minimum thickness of 0.2 μm, a fewer macroscopic defects, and a lower interface roughness than the BaTiO 3 films on Cu substrates. Thus, we discussed that the high leakage currents were related to macroscopic defects and a rough interface [14].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{model is}} {{established}} to {{research on the}} applicability of network protection in theory. In this model, distributed power generation with constant power (PQ) control mode which is equivalent to a voltage control current source is taken as the research object. Fault ride-through control theory is {{used to analyze the}} influence on the network protection exerted by three-phase short-circuit fault. In this paper, the equivalent model of the distributed generation is offered firstly. Then the three-phase <b>short-circuit</b> fault <b>characteristics</b> are illustrated based on the equations of the access point’s voltage and the distributed generation’s current. In the end, a simulation model is built to verify that the network protection can be applied to settle the three-phase short-circuit fault in the distributed network with distributed generation...|$|R
40|$|A {{centralized}} grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) {{station is}} a widely adopted method of neutral grounding using resistance, which can potentially make pre-existing protection systems invalid and threaten the safety of power grids. Therefore, studying the fault characteristics of grid-connected PV systems {{and their impact on}} power-grid protection is of great importance. Based on an analysis of the grid structure of a grid-connected PV system and of the low-voltage ride-through control characteristics of a photovoltaic power supply, this paper proposes a short-circuit calculation model and a fault-calculation method for this kind of system. With respect to the change of system parameters, particularly the resistance connected to the neutral point, and the possible impact on protective actions, this paper achieves the general rule of <b>short-circuit</b> current <b>characteristics</b> through a simulation, which provides a reference for devising protection configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{open-circuit}} voltage and short-circuit current of large-grain (1 to 10 mm grain diameter) polycrystalline silicon solar cells {{is determined by}} the minority-carrier diffusion length within the bulk of the grains. This was demonstrated by irradiating polycrystalline and single-crystal (Czochralski) silicon solar cells with 1 MeV electrons to reduce their bulk lifetime. The variation of short-circuit current with minority-carrier diffusion length for the polycrystalline solar cells is identical to that of the single-crystal solar cells. The {{open-circuit voltage}} versus <b>short-circuit</b> current <b>characteristic</b> of the polycrystalline solar cells for reduced diffusion lengths is also identical to that of the single-crystal solar cells. The open-circuit voltage of the polycrystalline solar cells is a strong function of quasi-neutral (bulk) recombination, and is reduced only slightly, if at all, by grain-boundary recombination...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} for a device for {{protecting}} an alternating-current network is offered. It {{is based on}} a combination of a superconducting limiter of a short-circuit current and a circuit breaker.

50|$|Closed-core {{transformers}} {{are constructed}} in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings {{are surrounded by}} the core, the transformer is shell form. Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils. Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications {{at the lower end}} of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent. Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better <b>short-circuit</b> strength <b>characteristics</b> and higher immunity to transit damage.|$|R

The Cu 2 S layer was obtained by the dry method, i. e. by evaporation of a CuCl film followed by heat treatment. The photovoltaic properties including I–V <b>characteristics,</b> <b>short-circuit</b> current (Isc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), efficiency (η) of Cu 2 S/CdS heterojunction cells have been examined after formation. Heat treatment improved the photovoltaic cells. High resistivity of CdS thin film, high series resistance and the poor design of the grid have lead to low efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{low-voltage}} distribution {{networks have}} some structural features, such as short supply line, more lines branch {{and influence of}} transition resistance of the <b>short-circuit</b> current. These <b>characteristics</b> seriously affect the development of fault location technology. The paper, based {{on the basis of}} the structural features about the low-voltage distribution networks, create the distribution networks of description matrix by knowledge of mathematical topology and use the distribution network fault location algorithm based on web-based structure matrix. By the algorithm, the area of fault judgment and the actual distribution network fault location are fully consistent. The new theory provides a new way of thinking for fault location in low-voltage distribution networks...|$|R
40|$|A DC {{distribution}} system, {{which is}} suitable for access to distributed power generation and DC loads, {{is one of the}} development directions in power systems. Furthermore, it could greatly improve the energy efficiency and reduce the loss of power transportation. The huge short circuit current is always a great threat to the safety of the components, especially the capacitors and diodes. A resistive superconductive fault current limiter (SFCL), which could respond quickly once a fault happens and limit the fault current to a relatively low level, becomes a good solution to this problem. In this paper, the operational principle of the resistive SFCL is introduced first, and then, the DC <b>short-circuit</b> fault <b>characteristic</b> of the DC distribution system with the SFCL is analyzed and the effectiveness of the SFCL verified. In order to realize the selectivity of the protection in the DC distribution system with SFCL, a new transient current protection principle based on Ip (the peak value of the current) and tp (the transient time that the current takes to reach its peak value) is proposed. Finally, a model of a 10 -kV DC distribution system with an SFCL is established and simulated in PSCAD/METDC. Simulation results have demonstrated the validity of the analysis and protection principle...|$|R
40|$|In the {{distribution}} network 110 kV of E. ON Company {{there are the}} nodal areas of Čebin substation and Sokolnice substation which are operated separately at the present time. There is one 400 / 110 kV transformer for each nodal area. In case of fault {{on one of these}} transformers or on busbar in which the set transformer is working, it comes to an outage of electric supply in the set nodal area. This problem has to be solved with help of the parallel operation of nodal areas of Čebín substation and Sokolnice substation. The main and also the practical task of this work is to design the bridge connection appropriate for parallel operation of nodal areas (supply transformers 400 / 110 kV). With help of a computing program there were made calculations of steady state and short-circuit conditions in distribution network 110 kV for separated and parallel operation of nodal areas. Voltage conditions, load of transformers (400 / 110 kV and 110 /vn kV) and conditions on 110 kV lines are evaluated and controlled as the result of steady state calculations. Based on short-circuit conditions there is controlled the short-circuit resistance of the substations. Finally there are compared advantages and disadvantages of separated and parallel operations of nodal areas. If necessary, technical arrangements required for introduction of parallel operation of nodal areas of Čebín substation and Sokolnice substation will be designed. The theoretical part of the work deals with calculation of steady state with help of iterative methods, namely Newton´s and Gauss-Seidel methods. There are further described the method of calculating <b>short-circuit</b> currents, <b>characteristic</b> values and time behaviours of short-circuit current...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the short-circuit {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process under the control of two current-controlled techniques is investigated in detail using a custom built, high performance power source. The objective of these techniques is to provide significant improvements in process control compared to that obtained by using conventional constant voltage power sources. The first control technique, described as 2 ̆ 2 open loop 2 ̆ 2, has a fixed, preprogrammed response to key events within the process that define various states of the weld cycle. The response parameters are adjusted to suit the wire feed speed, welding travel speed and shielding gas mixture. Adaption to the requirements of the process occurs automatically, since the timing of the responses is determined solely by events at the weld. This technique produces stable, low-spatter welds with excellent bead appearance across a very wide range of wire feed speeds and contact tip to workpiece distance (CTWD values. Operation does not depend on synchronising the weld cycle frequency with the natural frequency of the weld pool. The technique also significantly decouples key welding parameters such as peak arc length, fusion area, and <b>short-circuit</b> metal transfer <b>characteristics.</b> Following investigation of this technique, a new approach is proposed. This 2 ̆ 2 closed loop 2 ̆ 2 control aims to regulate the size of the droplet formed {{at the end of the}} electrode on a cycle-by-cycle basis. A model of the instantaneous melting rate is developed to predict droplet size. A novel method is used to estimate the CTWD using 2 ̆ 2 through the arc 2 ̆ 2 sensing techniques. The objectives of this technique are to increase process stability and to further reduce spatter. These aims were achieved under a limited set of operating conditions. The {{performance of}} this second technique is influenced by weld pool oscillation but the key benefit of parameter decoupling is retained. The theoretical development of both techniques and experimental validation of their performance is detailed in this thesis...|$|R
