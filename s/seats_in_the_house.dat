5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Gillard sought Labor Party {{preselection}} {{twice for}} <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives {{during the early}} 1990s; however, she {{did not succeed in}} either attempt. In 1995, Gillard took a leave of absence from Slater & Gordon to contest the 1996 federal election. Gillard stood as a Senate candidate, having been preselected for the third position on Labor's ticket, although she was not elected to the position.|$|E

50|$|The Conservative MP since 1895 was Lord Balcarres. Upon {{the death}} of his father on 31 January 1913, he {{inherited}} the title of the Earl of Crawford and a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords. This meant that he had to resign his <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons.|$|R

5|$|Life peerages {{were also}} offered {{to members of}} the royal family with new {{hereditary}} peerages, but declined (as it would have meant they would hold <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords): Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers, the first dukes.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the Republican majority in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} gave Harper's Conservatives {{the largest}} number of <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> although not enough for a majority government, and shortly after midnight on January 24, Martin conceded defeat. Later that day, Martin informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean that he would resign as prime minister, and at 6:45p.m. Jean asked Harper to form a government. Harper was sworn in as Canada's 22nd prime minister on February 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom general election, 2017, the Conservative Party won 317 seats (the Speaker of the House {{not being}} counted as a Conservative), {{more than any}} other party, though not enough to achieve an overall majority. The Conservative party, headed by the prime {{minister}} Theresa May, won 55 more seats than the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn. The Scottish National Party (Scotland only) won 35 out of 59 Scottish <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E
50|$|The Conservative MP, Rupert Guinness, Viscount Elveden succeeded {{his father}} as Earl of Iveagh and took a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords, vacating his <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons.

5|$|Washington {{exercised}} {{his presidential}} veto {{power for the}} first time on April 5, 1792 to stop an apportionment act from becoming law. The legislation introduced a new plan for distributed <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives among the various states in a way that the president deemed unconstitutional. After attempting but failing to override the veto, Congress swiftly crafted new legislation, the Apportionment Act of 1792, which Washington signed into law on April 14.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, {{receiving}} 49.2percent of {{the popular}} vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7percent {{of the popular}} vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4percent {{of the popular vote}}), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once. The Republicans lost three <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E

5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of Canada is an {{official}} {{who serves as}} the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have {{the confidence of the}} elected House of Commons. Normally, this {{is the leader of the}} party caucus with the greatest number of <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{province}} has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, {{in which}} the Premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of Australian Leaders of the Op{{position}}. The Leader of the Opposition in Australian Federal Politics is a Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives. The {{position is}} held by the leader of the party not in government that has the most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> When in parliament, the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and opposite the Prime Minister. The Opposition Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new Opposition Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of a recession in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament. Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the Labour Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labour's attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the Labour Party by Ed Miliband.|$|E
