5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or <b>symbolic</b> <b>description</b> of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a <b>symbolic</b> <b>description</b> of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe. Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations. The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the I Ching. For example, the Wenyan provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with Heaven and Earth, and the Shuogua attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.|$|E

Instead of modifying the image file format by adding some extra header information, watermarking is used to embed the KD in the pixel gray-level values of the corresponding images.

40|$|Abstract. Symbolic Data Analysis {{allow for}} the {{extension}} of Data Analysis to symbolic data, that is, more complex data structures than classical or monovalued data.

Strata Decision Tree is a generalized recursive tree-building algorithm (Breiman et al., 1984) for populations partitioned into strata and described by symbolic data. Common predictor and class variables describe population in all strata. Tree-growing methods are in general recursive non-parametric classification methods that recursively obtain the binary partition in the population which maximizes an information content measure of the new splits with respect to predefined classes. Our segmentation method is applied when the underlying population is not only subdivided into the classes to be investigated, but it is simultaneously composed of groups of individuals, which will be called strata such as when individuals of a country are partitioned into regions, individuals of a region are partitioned into towns, companies are partitione...|$|R

40|$|International audienceObjective : A general {{method was}} {{developed}} to analyze and describe tree-like structures needed for evaluation of complex morphology, such as the cerebral vascular tree. Clinical application of the method in neurosurgery includes planning of the surgeon's intraoperative gestures. Method : We have developed a 3 D skeletonization method adapted to tubular forms with <b>symbolic</b> <b>description.</b> This approach implements an iterative Dijkstra minimum cost spanning tree, allowing a branch-by-branch skeleton extraction. The proposed method was implemented using the laboratory software platform (ArtiMed). The 3 D skeleton approach was tested on simulated data and preliminary trials on clinical datasets mainly based on magnetic resonance image acquisitions. Results : A specific experimental evaluation plan was designed to test the skeletonization and <b>symbolic</b> <b>description</b> methods. Accuracy was tested by calculating the positioning error, and robustness was verified {{by comparing the results}} on a series of 18 rotations of the initial volume. Accuracy evaluation showed a Haussdorff's distance always smaller than 17 voxels and Dice's similarity coefficient greater than 70 %.

40|$|Successful human-robot {{cooperation}} {{hinges on}} each agent's ability to process and exchange {{information about the}} shared environment and the task at hand. Human communication is primarily based on symbolic abstractions of object properties, rather than precise quantitative measures. A comprehensive robotic framework thus requires an integrated communication module which is able to establish a link and convert between perceptual and abstract information. The ability to interpret composite <b>symbolic</b> <b>descriptions</b> enables an autonomous agent to a) operate in unstructured and cluttered environments, in tasks which involve unmodeled or never seen before objects; and b) exploit the aggregation of multiple symbolic properties as an instance of ensemble learning, to improve identification performance even when the individual predicates encode generic information or are imprecisely grounded. We propose a discriminative probabilistic model which interprets <b>symbolic</b> <b>descriptions</b> to identify the referent object contextually w. r. t. {{the structure of the}} environment and other objects.
