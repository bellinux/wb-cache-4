5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft <b>separation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} {{molecular}} mechanisms behind adsorption and the separations of mixtures in metal-organic frameworks and zeolites. <b>Separation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can {{be based on}} differences in the affinity of the adsorbate with the framework and on entropic effects. To develop next-generation adsorbents, the separation efficiency of the materials needs to be improved. The performance under industrially relevant conditions largely depends on two factors: 1) the separation selectivity and 2) the pore volume capacity of the material. Enthalpic mechanisms can lead to increased selectivities, but these are mostly restricted to the low loading regime, and hence these mechanisms are unable {{to make use of}} all of the large-pore volume that a metal-organic framework can provide. Industrial processes routinely operate in the pore saturation regime. In this Review, we focus on entropic molecular <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that are effective under these conditions and, in particular, on a recent methodology to obtain high selectivities at high pore loading...|$|R
40|$|Metal-semiconductor heterostructures are {{promising}} visible light photocatalysts for many chemical reactions. Here, we use high-resolution superlocalization imaging {{to reveal the}} nature and photocatalytic properties of the surface reactive sites on single Au-CdS hybrid nanocatalysts. We experimentally reveal two distinct, incident energy-dependent charge <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that result in completely opposite photogenerated reactive sites (e- and h+) and divergent energy flows on the hybrid nanocatalysts. We find that plasmon-induced hot electrons in Au are injected into the conduction band of the CdS semiconductor nanorod. The specifically designed Au-tipped CdS heterostructures with a unique geometry (two Au nanoparticles {{at both ends of}} each CdS nanorod) provide more convincing high-resolution single-turnover mapping results and clearly prove the two charge <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Engineering the direction of energy flow at the nanoscale can provide an efficient way to overcome important challenges in photocatalysis, such as controlling catalytic activity and selectivity. These results bear enormous potential impact on the development of better visible light photocatalysts for solar-to-chemical energy conversion...|$|R
50|$|Two-dimensional {{chromatography}} {{is a type}} of chromatographic {{technique in}} which the injected sample is separated by passing through two different separation stages. This is done by injecting the eluent from the first column onto a second column. Typically the second column has a different <b>separation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> so that bands that are poorly resolved from the first column may be completely separated in the second column. (For instance, a C18 reversed-phase chromatography column may be followed by a phenyl column.) Alternately, the two columns might run at different temperatures. The second stage of the separation must be run much faster than the first, since there is still only a single detector. The plane surface is amenable to sequential development in two directions using two different solvents.|$|E
50|$|Samos 2 was {{launched}} on January 31, 1961, on Atlas 70D/Agena 2102. Unlike with Samos 1, {{the weather was}} foggy and gray, and the pad was not even visible from the blockhouse. This time, everything worked perfectly and Samos 2 achieved orbit. The F-1 ferret system was tested first, followed by the E-1 electro-optical cameras, which transmitted images of approximately 100 feet of resolution. On orbit 21, ground controllers sent the command to jettison the F-1 antenna, which was partially obstructing the camera, {{in the hopes of}} even better images. However, something went disastrously wrong when all telemetry signals from Samos 2 ceased. It was believed that the <b>separation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the F-1 antenna had caused the partial or complete disintegration of the satellite vehicle. Samos 2 remained in orbit until it decayed into the atmosphere in 1971.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} capillary {{liquid chromatography}} (LC) method is described {{which is based}} on microfractionation, automated reinjection, and rechromatography using an automated microcolumn switching setup to separate complex peptide mixtures from different origin. Different types of separations modes, i. e., hydrophobic and charge <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> have been applied to increase the selectivity and peak capacity and to approach orthogonal <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The first-dimension <b>separations</b> were carried out by either reversed-phase chromatography or strong anion exchange chromatography. The second-dimension separation was in all cases reversed-phase capillary LC. In case of two-dimensional reversed/reversed-phase separations, some degree of orthogonality was achieved by using either two different sets of mobile phase solvents and one reversed-phase capillary LC column or a single set of mobile phases and two capillary LC columns packed with different-reversed-phase stationary phases. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was conducted to confirm the orthogonality of the developed two-dimensional capillary LC technique.

40|$|International audienceA {{carefully}} controlled, custom-built adhesion {{testing device}} was developed which allows a precise, short dwell {{time on the}} order of milliseconds to be applied during a contact adhesion experiment. The dwell time dependence of the adhesive strength of crosslinked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) in contact with glass and uncrosslinked styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) in contact with glass and with itself was tested with a spherical probe in a confined Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) geometry. Analysis of the contact images revealed several unique <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which are dependent on dwell time and interfacial properties. PDMS-glass interfaces show essentially no dependence of adhesion on the dwell time while the adhesive strength and <b>separation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of SBR interfaces are shown to vary drastically for dwell times ranging from 40 to 10 ? 000 ms. This influence of dwell time is particularly pronounced for polymer-polymer (SBR-SBR) interfaces.

5000|$|Xerox art (sometimes, more generically, called copy art, {{electrostatic}} art, or xerography) is an {{art form}} {{that began in the}} 1960s. Prints are created by putting objects on the glass, or platen, of a copying machine and by pressing [...] "start" [...] to produce an image. If the object is not flat, or the cover does not totally cover the object, or the object is moved, the resulting image is distorted in some way. The curvature of the object, the amount of light that reaches the image surface, and the distance of the cover from the glass, all affect the final image. Often, with proper manipulation, rather ghostly images can be made. Basic techniques include: Direct Imaging, the copying of items placed on the platen (normal copy); Still Life Collage, a variation of direct imaging with items placed on the platen in a collage format focused on what is in the foreground/background; Overprinting, the technique of constructing layers of information, one over the previous, by printing onto the same sheet of paper more than once; Copy Overlay, a technique of working with or interfering in the color <b>separation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a color copier; Colorizing, vary color density and hue by adjusting the exposure and color balance controls; Degeneration is a copy of a copy degrading the image as successive copies are made; Copy Motion, the creation of effects by moving an item or image on the platen during the scanning process. Each machine also creates different effects.|$|E
