40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} satisfy the <b>serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states,</b> a {{concrete}} structure must be serviceable and perform its intended function throughout its working life. Excessive deflection should not impair {{the function of the}} structure or be aesthetically unacceptable. Cracks should not be unsightly or wide enough to lead to durability problems. Design for the <b>serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> involves making reliable predictions of the instantaneous and time-dependent deformation of the structure. This is complicated by the non-linear behaviour of concrete caused mainly by cracking, tension stiffening, creep and shrinkage. This paper provides an overview of the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams and slabs at service loads and outlines a reliable method for the calculation of deflection...|$|E

40|$|A system {{reliability}} approach to minimizing the life-cycle {{cost of a}} deteriorating structure offers significant advantages such as a rational assessment of the assumed risk of failure, {{and an understanding of}} the importance and contribution of individual components to the overall reliability of the structure. The reliability of a structural system as a whole is the measure of its overall performance. This measure has to include both ultimate and <b>serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states.</b> A system model of a structure traditionally consists of a series-parallel combination of strength-based component limit states. <b>Serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> however, can play a tremendously important role in optimizing the inspection and repair of a deteriorating structure. This paper proposes the use of serviceability flags as a means to incorporate serviceability concerns into a strength-based reliability analysis.

The project, if successfully that will significantly improve the lack of traditional analysis. The developed framework provides engineers with a ability to assess the reliability of deep excavation and its impact on adjacent buildings.

40|$|International audienceA reliability-based {{analysis}} of a strip foundation subjected to a central vertical load is presented. Both the ultimate and the <b>serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> are considered. Two deterministic models based on numerical simulations are used. The first one computes the ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation and the second one calculates the footing displacement due to an applied load. The response surface methodology is utilized {{for the assessment of}} the Hasofer–Lind reliability indexes. Only the soil shear strength parameters are considered as random variables while studying the ultimate limit state. Also, the randomness of only the soil elastic properties is taken into account in the serviceability limit state. The assumption of uncorrelated variables was found to be conservative in comparison to the one of negatively correlated variables. The failure probability of the ultimate limit state was highly influenced by the variability of the angle of internal friction. However, for the serviceability limit state, the accurate determination of the uncertainties of the Young’s modulus was found to be very important in obtaining reliable probabilistic results.

40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{contemporary}} structural {{materials that are}} becoming more resistant, having higher strength to weight ratio, {{and the fact that}} live load of footbridges is low, the design based on static analysis only, respecting ultimate limit states requirements, leads to slender bridge structures for pedestrian and cycle track use. As a consequence, stiffness and masses decrease, facing lively, easy to excite structures, with smaller natural frequencies. The excitation of a footbridge by a pedestrian passing over it can be unpleasant for a person walking or standing on the bridge, but usually not destructive for the structure itself. Recent experiences regarding dynamic behavior of slender footbridges have especially shown that vibration <b>serviceability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> are very important requirements in any structural design. We are presenting a general algorithm for analytical testing of dynamic parameters of structures, calculation of deflection, thus speed and acceleration of superstructure under human-induced excitation, as predicted by Eurocode, British and Canadian standards in use, since no Yugoslav code deals with the problem. The evaluated system is a footbridge in a system of a simply supported concrete girder. The presented model is used to show correspondence of results, obtained by the algorithm, with the results obtained using the simplified methods suggested by the Codes of Practice, since the latter exists only for certain structural systems.
