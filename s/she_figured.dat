25|$|A {{municipal}} by-election {{was held}} in Hénin-Beaumont on 28 June and 5 July 2009. Like in 2008, Steeve Briois was the FN top candidate whereas <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> in second position.|$|E
25|$|Wasp later {{caught up}} with the Uncanny Avengers and confronted the Hank Pym/Ultron after helping to fend off the monsters in the subway. When Wasp asked the Hank Pym/Ultron about the recent events, <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> out that Ultron is in control of Hank Pym when Ultron guessed wrong. The rest of the Uncanny Avengers were {{informed}} of this causing Cable to pressure Hank Pym enough for Ultron to go on the attack and reveal his true self.|$|E

I couldn't think of anything for that particular part. It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the liminal drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Kenny rejoins his friends, who are {{dressed up for}} a Halloween costume contest. Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy would be going as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up looking more like a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E

2500|$|His great {{grandson}} John Black Feather said [...] "Back then, {{they had}} burials at sea, they did ask his wife {{if she wanted}} to take him home and <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> that as soon as they hit the water they would throw him overboard, so that's why they left him here." ...|$|E
60|$|This did {{not seem}} to affect Emmy. She even smiled a little. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> Jos to herself panting up the stair.|$|E
60|$|That {{was in the}} Colosseum, {{and it was as}} far as {{they got}} that day, because Helen {{returned}} with Fanny--she had taken her into the upper galleries. Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and concrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. <b>She</b> <b>figured</b> that pleasant young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his students, herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper; <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> a refined little home, with two bureaus, with white shelves of high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne Jones, with Morris's wall-papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper. Indeed <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> many things. On the Pincio the two had a few precious moments together, while Helen marched Fanny off to see the muro Torto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their friendship was only beginning, that he already found her company very precious to him, that indeed it was more than that.|$|E
60|$|Atossa now, by {{that strange}} {{principle}} of succession {{which has been}} already alluded to, became the wife of Darius, and <b>she</b> <b>figures</b> frequently and conspicuously in history during his long and splendid reign.|$|R

50|$|Post Grad is a 2009 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Vicky Jenson and starring Alexis Bledel, about a recent college graduate who moves {{back in with}} her family while <b>she</b> <b>figures</b> out what <b>she</b> wants to do next.|$|R
60|$|And yet {{nobody could}} have worked harder or done better {{in all the}} {{recognized}} stages of a young man's life than Ralph had done, and Joan had to gather materials for her fears from trifles in her brother's behavior which would have escaped any other eye. It was natural {{that she should be}} anxious. Life had been so arduous for all of them from the start that she could not help dreading any sudden relaxation of his grasp upon what he held, though, as she knew from inspection of her own life, such sudden impulse to let go and make away from the discipline and the drudgery was sometimes almost irresistible. But with Ralph, if he broke away, she knew that it would be only to put himself under harsher constraint; <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> him toiling through sandy deserts under a tropical sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some fly; <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> him living by the labor of his hands in some city slum, the victim of one of those terrible theories of right and wrong which were current at the time; <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> him prisoner for life in the house of a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes. Half proudly, and wholly anxiously, she framed such thoughts, as they sat, late at night, talking together over the gas-stove in Ralph's bedroom.|$|E
60|$|The car {{interested}} her. It {{seemed a}} palace and of enormous size. <b>She</b> <b>figured</b> out {{the number of}} people it would hold, and wondered how the seats which were turned the other way came to be so. The car was mainly occupied by men in careless clothing. Everybody seemed sleepy and unkempt. She wondered where they all came from, and so speculating, she lost something of her poignant sorrow.|$|E
60|$|All this {{accordingly}} took place. The experienced performer {{who acted}} the heroines now {{came forward and}} disported most jocundly. The failure of Flora had given fresh animation to her perpetual liveliness. She seemed the very soul of elegant frolic. In the last scene <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> in male attire; and in air, fashion, and youth, beat Villebecque out of the field. She looked younger than Coningsby when {{he went up to}} his grandpapa.|$|E
50|$|Jerry is {{the prime}} suspect. Mr. Ketterling (Pierre Watkin), who is Jerry's employer, hires Sally to prove him innocent. Shane could be behind it, <b>she</b> <b>figures,</b> but Shane's murdered body is found as well, and Sally catches a whiff of a {{familiar}} perfume, Lola's.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>she</b> <b>figures</b> as a sculpture, perplexed by {{the whisper}} kid, but finally she looks {{straight}} in a [...] camera while she sings her ode to love, she expresses her {{devotion to the}} subject (“love is the only master I’ll serve”) by her self-chosen verbal communication; ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{things may}} be looking up. Koganemaru, {{the son of an}} intergalactic billionaire has been kidnapped. This may be the chance that Maris needed to become financially independent, as <b>she</b> <b>figures</b> that he'll be so indebted to her that he might ask for her hand in her marriage.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wendover {{called for}} his cicerone and {{they agreed to}} go in a romantic, Bohemian manner (the young man was very docile and appreciative about this), walking the short {{distance}} to the Victoria station and taking the mysterious underground railway. In the carriage she anticipated the inquiry that <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> to herself he presently would make and said, laughing: 'No, no, this is very exceptional; if we were both English--and both what we are, otherwise--we wouldn't do this.' ...|$|E
60|$|Violet {{saw them}} in {{frequent}} consultation, and once John {{said something to}} her of his hopes of seeing her at Brogden; then, finding her in ignorance, drew back, but not till he had said {{enough to make her}} restless at hearing no more. She would, of course, have preferred living in the country; but when <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> to herself Arthur always with Theodora, and herself shut up in the little parlour she had seen in the rain, she grew extremely disconsolate.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} {{to give her a}} sense of proportion. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> England to herself as {{about the size of the}} Pearl of the Ocean; in which case it would certainly have been reeking with gore and a mere wreck of burgled houses from end to end. One could not make her understand that these horrors on which she fed her imagination were lost in the mass of orderly life like a few drops of blood in the ocean. She directed upon me for a moment the uncomprehending glance of her narrowed eyes and then would turn her scornful powdered face away without a word. She would not even take the trouble to shrug her shoulders.|$|E
50|$|Bacca {{joined the}} cast {{at the start}} of the second cycle and {{remained}} for its third as the second vedette. Estefanía showed her skills in acting, acrobatics and dance, this being the first time <b>she</b> <b>figures</b> in a musical or play rather them being a basic actress or dancer.|$|R
50|$|On 26 June 2004, after a {{courtship}} of some years, {{she married}} former Premier of Quebec and then Parti Québécois leader Bernard Landry. <b>She</b> <b>figures</b> {{prominently in the}} 2003 documentary À Hauteur d'homme about the 2003 Quebec general election, during which Landry defended his post as leader of Quebec.|$|R

She uses a laser pistol in combat.|$|R
6000|$|Moreover, Lady Temple's mind became {{extremely}} uneasy as to {{the manner}} in which Rachel might accept her exploit. All her valour departed as <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> to herself that young lady discrediting the alarm, and resenting her interference. She did not repent, she knew she could not have helped it, and she had rather have been tortured by Rachel than have left the victims another hour to the F. U. E. E., but she was full of nervous anxiety, little as she yet guessed at the full price of her courage; and she uttered more than once the fervent wish that the Colonel had been there, for he would have known what to do. And Alison each time replied, [...] "I wish it with all my heart!" ...|$|E
60|$|I asked Solivet {{whether we}} might expect the young man on leaving the Louvre, and he only shrugged his {{shoulders}} and said: 'What know I?' It became plain {{to me that he}} would not discuss the matter before his daughters, now fourteen and fifteen, and we all had to sit down to an early supper, after which they were to be taken back to their convent. M. d'Aubepine appeared, and was quite cheerful, for <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> to herself once more that her husband was only detained by his duties and his value to his Prince, and was burning every moment to see his little ones. She asked questions about him, and became radiant when she heard of his courage at Lens, and the compliments that M. le Prince had paid to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Katharine indifferently. [...] "You've been {{neglecting}} {{my education}} lately, by the way. I wish you'd read something. Let me choose a book." [...] So speaking, she went across to his bookshelves and began looking in a desultory way among his books. Anything, she thought, {{was better than}} bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the distance between them. As she pulled one book forward and then another she thought ironically of her own certainty not an hour ago; how it had vanished in a moment, how she was merely marking time as best she could, not knowing in the least where they stood, what they felt, or whether William loved her or not. More and more the condition of Mary's mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable--if, indeed, it could be quite as <b>she</b> <b>figured</b> it--if, indeed, simplicity existed for {{any one of the}} daughters of women.|$|E
50|$|Margaret Tripp was a lady of many {{educational}} {{interests and}} long teaching experience. Assisted {{by two of}} her sisters, she took over Toorak College on 4 February 1895. <b>She</b> <b>figures</b> prominently in the school's history, because, in 1897, she changed Toorak College from a boys' school to a school for girls.|$|R
50|$|Rion Kanou - A {{teenager}} who initially suspects that the Host Club Krankenhaus {{is behind the}} disappearance of several people in her community, including her best friend.
