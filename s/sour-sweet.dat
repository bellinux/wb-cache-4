The phrase [...] "as queer as a clockwork orange" [...] is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined.

60|$|He dressed {{himself with}} window thrown {{open to the}} {{blackbirds}} and thrushes, and the occasional shrill solitary whistling of a robin. But, like the <b>sour-sweet</b> fragrance of the brier, its wandering desolate burst of music had power to wake memory, and carried him instantly back to that first aimless descent into the evening gloom of Widderstone from which it was in vain to hope ever to climb again. Surely never a more ghoulish face looked out on its man before than that which confronted him as with borrowed razor he stood shaving those sunken chaps, that angular chin.|$|E
60|$|So {{much for}} the giant weed of the Morichal, from which we rode on and up through rolling country growing lovelier at every step, and turned {{out of our way}} to see wild pine-apples in a sandy spot, or 'Arenal' in a valley beneath. The meeting of the stiff marl and the fine sand was abrupt, and well marked by the vegetation. On one side of the ravine the tall fan-leaved Carats marked the rich soil; on the other, the sand and gravel loving Cocorites {{appeared}} at once, crowding their ostrich plumes together. Most of them were the common species of the island {202a} in which the pinnae of the leaves grow in fours and fives, and at different angles from the leaf-stalk, giving the whole a brushy appearance, which takes off somewhat from the perfectness of its beauty. But among them we saw- -for the first and last time in the forest--a few of a far more beautiful species, {202b} common on the mainland. In it, the pinnae are set on all at the same distance apart, and all in the same plane, in opposite sides of the stalk, giving to the whole foliage a grand simplicity; and producing, when the curving leaf-points toss in the breeze, that curious appearance, which I mentioned in an earlier chapter, of green glass wheels with rapidly revolving spokes. At their feet grew the pine-apples, only in flower or unripe fruit, so that we could not quench our thirst with them, and only looked with curiosity at the small wild type of so famous a plant. But close by, and happily nearly ripe, we found a fair substitute for pine-apples in the fruit of the Karatas. This form of Bromelia, closely allied to the Pinguin of which hedges are made, bears a straggling plume of prickly leaves, six or eight feet long each, close to the ground. The forester looks for a plant in which the leaves droop outwards--a sign that the fruit is ripe. After beating it cautiously (for snakes are very fond of coiling under its shade) he opens the centre, and finds, close to the ground, a group of whitish fruits, nearly two inches long; peels carefully off the skin, which is beset with innumerable sharp hairs, and eats the <b>sour-sweet</b> refreshing pulp: but not too often, for there are always hairs enough left to make the tongue bleed if {{more than one or two}} are eaten.|$|E

Max on the other hand, who had been abused and overworked by the Grinch, goes home with Euchariah. Back in Whoville, the residents (including Euchariah's grandfather Josiah and his grandmother Mariah) celebrate the little Who's courage in preventing the Grinch from releasing the Paraphernalia Wagon's full horrors on their town and up in the mountains the Grinch, who is hauling the wagon home himself, ominously notes that one day there will be another Grinch Night when the <b>Sour-Sweet</b> Wind blows once more.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} white {{hermaphroditic}} blossoms in leafy bracts located 2-4 each on short peduncles in sessile umbels. They are pollinated by bees. In the Northern Hemisphere, the plant flowers in May. The fruit is light to dark red, globose to pyriform, about 8-25 mm in diameter, ripening in August. The taste is <b>sour-sweet,</b> or tart.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} on Madras curry and cooking in India {{is more a}} domestic practice than a cuisine governed by the conventions of chefs, restaurants, or texts. This curry can be vegetarian or made with meat. Availability of local or locally available ingredients is central to regional Indian foods. The end result of the signatures of Madras curries can be achieved through different means; the result often being that of: red colour; toasty spices; and the smoothness of coconut (or yoghurt); the <b>sour-sweet</b> fruitiness of tamarind; a slight liquorice flavour of anise; ginger; a range of other spices (sweet and savoury and earthy) and the flavours of salt, sweet and sour. The redness is achieved with chilli or a mixture of chilli and paprika, and the orange of turmeric. Additional sourness may be had from lemon, lime or vinegar.|$|E
5000|$|Swedish pickled {{cucumbers}} (pressgurka) are thinly sliced, {{mixed with}} salt and pressed to drain some water from the cucumber slices. Afterwards placed in a jar with a <b>sour-sweet</b> brine of vinegar, sugar, dill and mustard seeds. Danish cucumber salad (agurkesalat) is similar, but the cucumbers are not pressed and the brine doesn't have parsley. The cucumber salad accompanies meat dishes, especially a roasted chicken dish (gammeldags kylling med agurkesalat), and is used on Danish hot dogs. There are also [...] "long time pickles", which call for some months of cool storing {{in order to be}} edible.

40|$|Commercial juices {{of sweet}} {{pomegranates}} and fresh juices of <b>sour–sweet</b> pomegranates were analysed for organic acids, sugars, antioxidant activity, volatile composition, sensory profile and consumer liking. Organic acids and sugars were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography, while volatiles were extracted using hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography– flame ionisation detector. Malic acid was predominant in sweet juices while citric acid in <b>sour–sweet</b> samples. Fructose and glucose were found as the predominant sugars in all juices. A total of 18 compounds {{were found in}} pomegranate aroma profile, including monoterpenes, aldehydes, alcohols, monoterpenoids and linear hydrocarbons; the most abundant compounds were 3 -carene, a-terpinene and a-terpineol. The total concentration of volatiles ranged from 2. 0 up to 5. 1 mg/L, with commercial samples presenting higher total concentrations due {{to the presence of}} peel volatiles. The high potential of <b>sour-sweet</b> pomegranate fruits for the juice industry was supported by (a) the high values of positive attributes, such as colour and fresh pomegranate flavour and (b) the high overall liking of consumers...|$|E
40|$|In our study, for a {{small number}} of antonyms, we {{investigate}} whether they are cross-modally or ideaesthetically related to the space of colors. We analyze the affinities of seven antonyms (cold-hot, dull-radiant, dead-vivid, soft-hard, transparent-chalky, dry-wet, and acid-treacly) and their intermediate connotations (cool-warm, matt-shiny, numb-lively, mellow-firm, semi-transparent-opaque, semi-dry-moist, and <b>sour-sweet)</b> as a function of color. We find that some antonyms relate to chromatic dimensions, others to achromatic ones. The cold-hot antonym proves to be the most salient dimension. The dry-wet dimension coincides with the cold-hot dimension, with dry corresponding to hot and wet to cold. The acid-treacly dimension proves to be transversal to the cold-hot dimension; hence, the pairs mutually span the chromatic domain. The cold-hot and acid-treacly antonyms perhaps recall Hering's opponent color system. The dull-radiant, transparent-chalky, and dead-vivid pairs depend little upon chromaticity. Of all seven antonyms, only the soft-hard one turns out to be independent of the chromatic structure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFermented mashes {{based on}} {{different}} cereal grist are {{a healthy and}} nutritious beverage, a source for new functional products with beneficial effects on human health. These mashes are a thick consistency and <b>sour-sweet</b> taste, different colors depending on the ingredients and method of preparation. In this study were determined the main physical and chemical characteristics (pH, volatile and total acidity, total and soluble dry substances, alcohol concentration, dynamic viscosity) and was made sensorial analysis of some boiled aqueous mashes obtained from wheat, husked millet, barley malt and oat. Mashes were fermented at 30 °C with a mixed culture of mesophilic cheese lactic acid bacteria and wheat beer yeast for 23 h, followed by a cold maturation at 4 °C for 42 h. This study allows exploring the potential of different cereals to produce cereal-based beverages. The best results were obtained for mashes containing a larger amount of barley malt, followed by mashes with oat. Highest dynamic viscosities were recorded for mashes obtained only from wheat and millet. All determinations were made in triplicate and data were shown as mean ± SD...|$|E
40|$|New {{results of}} the clonal {{selection}} of apple tree (Malus domestica Borkh) conducted at Podillya Research Station of Horticultural Institute NAAS by method of state variety testing have been presented. By the {{results of the}} 6 -year studying (2007 - 2012) of 20 new Jonagold clones of domestic selection their estimation was carried out according to the complex of such qualities as productivity, early ripening, marketability, taste qualities and durability of fruits. The following clones are defined to be the best: DP- 16, DP- 17, DP- 18, DP- 20. They start fruiting in the age of 2 or 3 years, productivity of the 5 - or 6 -year-old trees reaches 8, 3 – 25, 5 tons per hectare, quantity of the fruits of the highest and first grade is about 57 – 76 % (in 2010 – 2012). Fruits of the mentioned clones are bigger than medium size (DP- 16), big (DP- 17, DP- 18) and very big (DP- 20); they have average similarity, excellent and very harmonious <b>sour-sweet</b> taste (8, 3 – 8, 7 points).

40|$|Psychophysical {{judgments}} often {{depend on}} stimulus context. For example, sugar solutions are judged sweeter when a tasteless fruity aroma has been added. Response context also matters; adding a fruity aroma to sugar increases the rated sweetness when only sweetness is considered {{but not when}} fruitiness is judged as well. The interaction between stimulus context and response context has been explored more extensively in taste–odor mixtures than in taste–taste mixtures. To address this issue, subjects {{in the current study}} rated the sourness of citric acid mixed with quinine (bitter), sodium chloride (salty), and cyclamate (sweet) (stimulus context). In one condition, subjects rated sourness alone. In another, subjects rated both sourness and the other salient quality (bitterness, saltiness, or sweetness) (response context). Sourness ratings were most sensitive to response context for sour–salty mixtures (i. e., ratings of sourness alone exceeded ratings of sourness made simultaneously with saltiness) and least sensitive to context for the <b>sour–sweet</b> mixtures (sourness ratings made under the 2 conditions were essentially identical). Response-context effects for the sour–bitter mixture were nominally intermediate. The magnitudes of these context effects were related to judgments of qualitative similarity between citric acid and the other stimuli, consistent with prior findings. These types of context effects are relevant to the study of taste–taste mixture interactions and should provide insight into the perceptual similarities among the taste qualities.
