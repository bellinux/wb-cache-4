5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have {{consulting}} status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 <b>scientists</b> <b>from</b> many nations.|$|E
5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising <b>scientists</b> <b>from</b> {{a number of}} different fields.
