Moreover, Ag nanoparticles are known for the antimicrobial [7], surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [8] and metal-enhanced fluorescence properties [9]. Silver nanoparticles are also known for cytoprotective and post-infected anti-HIV- 1 activities [10]. Ag nanorods have been synthesized by arc discharge technique [11], polyol process [12], hard template synthesis using porous materials such as mesoporous silica [13], and carbon nanotubes [14], using surfactants such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) [15], sodium dodecyl sulfonate [16], and dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid sodium (DBS) [17], seed-mediated [15] and seedless, and surfactantless wet chemical approach [18].

40|$|From Introduction]. The thermal {{decomposition}} of solids {{is characterized by}} the formation and growth of nuclei at sites {{on the surface of the}} solid or within the crystal lattice. Such nuclear formation is favoured by disorganisation of the crystal either by mechanical damage, or by the presence of impurities. Disorganisation results in positions which have a high thermodynamic instability. The nuclei are likely to be formed initially at the corners and the edges of the crystal since these are more prone to damage. Careful handling and storage in vacuo often leads to a large reduction in their number, while deliberate scratching of the surface facilitates their production. The number of potential sites for nuclear formation is also increased by pre-irradiation with ultra-violet light, though there are indications that a different type of nucleus may be produced. Nucleation can be facilitated by pre-irradiation with electrons, neutrons, X-rays, gamma-rays and atomic particles. The nature of the nuclei is not always clearly defined, but it is generally accepted that they are composed of solid reaction products e. g. in the decomposition of barium azide and <b>silver</b> <b>oxalate,</b> nuclei of metallic barium and silver, respectively, are formed...|$|E
30|$|Also, mere refluxing of PdCl 2 and {{potassium}} oxalate solution has not yielded any Pd nanoparticles even after 30 min. This observation reveals {{the importance of}} UV light for this decomposition reaction to occur for yielding metallic Pd. It is worthwhile to mention that more {{the intensity of the}} lamp more will be the conversion. Hence, in the current method, a high intensity lamp was utilized to synthesize Pd nanoparticles rapidly. Mechanism of decomposition of [Pd(C 2 O 4) 22 − {{is similar to that of}} <b>silver</b> <b>oxalate</b> (Ag 2 C 2 O 4) [22]. It is because decomposition of Ag 2 C 2 O 4 under UV light is also so rapid. Decomposition of Ag 2 C 2 O 4 is well explored in the literature [22]. Hence, mechanism of decomposition of [Pd(C 2 O 4) 22 − can be explained as follows. In this reaction, oxalate di anion in the intermediate complex, [Pd(C 2 O 4) 22 −, absorbs the light in the UV region [24], get excited and decomposes to CO 2. During the decomposition, electrons are transferred simultaneously to Pd 2 +. Thus, the reduction of Pd 2 + ions to yield Pd metal occurs. In general, this phenomenon is known as photo redox-decomposition [25]. Formation of CO 2 has been confirmed by the formation of white precipitate (BaCO 3) observed when the outlet of the reaction was dipped in Ba(OH) 2 (baryta) solution [26].|$|E

40|$|Theories of the {{formation}} of the Earth strongly suggest that the Earth should have been substantially molten during and immediately after accretion, when molten alloy and molten silicate underwent gravita-tional separation. It is expected hat during large-scale melting of the carbon-bearing mantle carbon-bearing liquids would be less effective at depleting silicate liquids in siderophile lements than C-free liquids. Nickel and cobalt show a modest reduction in siderophility at graphite saturation determined at 50 - 80 kbar and 2000 - 2300 ~ (Jana and Walker, 1997). This study was undertaken to exam the effect of pressure and elemental carbon and (CO,CO 2) fluid on equilibria between coexisting silicate and (Ni, Co) metallic carbon- bearing liquids at 7 - 15 kbar and 1350 - 1400 ~ Recently it has been proposed that carbon's volatility is strongly pressure-dependent (Wood, 1993). It is expected that addition of free carbon and CO,CO 2 to the system will effect the apparent partition coefficient by diluting the liquid metal with carbon and possible formation of metallic carbon- bearing species in the melt and the CO-CO 2 varpor phase (Kadik and Holloway, 1997).

40|$|The water {{activity}} except for pressure {{is known to}} be the most important parameter affecting the eutectic point in granitic systems. Water saturated magmas have lower solidus temperatures than water undersaturated magmas (Johannes, Holtz 1996). Water activity influences also Ab-Or relation in granitic systems (Holtz et al. 1992). Mineral phases present in water saturated conditions differ from those present in water poor conditions (Dall’Agnol et al. 1999). This effect of {{water activity}} on the granitic system has so far been analyzed on synthetic materials. Other parameters which would affect the eutectic point might exist in a natural granitic system. Therefore, two natural samples of Wangrah granites from Australia were taken to analyze their crystallization path. They were chosen so they had very similar composition in terms of Qz-Ab-Or, but different in terms of Ca and Fe contents. The homogenous glass powder was used as a starting material. The water was added to reach water saturated conditions. The water and <b>silver</b> <b>oxalate</b> were added to reach water undersaturated conditions. Crystallization experiments with both samples were performed in cold seal pressure vessel (CSPV) in the temperature range of 680 - 720 ºC for water saturated conditions and 765 - 815 ºC for water undersaturated conditions. The pressure of 2 kbar and oxygen buffer NNO were established for 15 days. The phases were identified and glass composition was determined by an electron microprobe. The water content of glass was measured with the use of near infrared spectroscopy. The results were plotted on the Qz-Ab-Or diagram with application of Blundy and Cashman corrections (Blundy, Cashman 2001) for the An content. Two very similar compositions in terms of Qz-Ab-Or show a different position of their cotectic lines for water saturated conditions. One possible explanation of this fact is that the projection of Blundy and Cashman does not account accurately for the effect of Ca. The alternative explanation is that there must be other parameters controlling the position of the cotectic line, one of them may be Fe. In any case, one cannot simply project natural granite or rhyolites on the Qz-Ab-Or diagram to extract quantitative information on pressure or water activity of granites or rhyolites.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{increasingly}} recognized that {{dramatic changes in}} magma storage conditions can occur over very {{short periods of time}} at a single volcano and might be in close relationships with stress variations imposed on the crustal plumbing by the overlying volcano as it changes shape and volume over time. The Santorini volcano (South Aegean Arc) is an ideal target to unravel these potential relationships as its history is marked by alternating episodes of edifice construction and caldera collapses and the chronostratigraphy is well constrained. We focused our study on the products of the four major, dominantly silicic, explosive eruptions of Santorini: the Lower Pumice 1 and 2 (200 to 180 ka; 1 st explosive cycle) and, the Cape Riva and the Minoan (~ 21 to 3 ka, 2 nd explosive cycle). In order to precisely define the P, T, fO 2, X (X for volatiles) storage conditions of the silicic magmas prior to these eruptions, we carried out a detailed micro-petrological and geochemical study on natural samples combined with an experimental work. The selected silicic components of the four eruptions are dacite to rhyodacite (SiO 2 = 67 - 70 wt. %) with similar mineral paragenesis (plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, magnetite, apatite ± pyrrhotite) and crystallinity < 20 %. High resolution BSE images of plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts and EMPA profiles reveal a complex crystallization history. Plagioclases display fine-scale oscillatory normal zoning, resorbtion zones where melt inclusions (MI) of rhyolitic compositions were trapped, and An-rich sieved cores. Clinopyroxenes also show zoning patterns and include rhyolitic MI. Both interstitial glass and MI are Cl-rich (~ 3000 ppm) while F and S are less abundant (F ≤ 700 ppm, S ≤ 100 ppm). Determination of H 2 O contents by SIMS is in progress at the CRPG-Nancy (previous measurements from the literature gave ~ 5 wt. % H 2 O in the Minoan rhyodacite and ~ 4 wt. % in the Lower Pumice 2). Ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry indicates temperatures ranging from ~ 850 to 900 °C and deltaNNO ~ - 1. For experimental work, the natural rocks were melted twice at 1400 °C and 1 atm; the resulting dry glasses were used as starting materials.

40|$|Volatiles are a {{fundamental}} {{component of the}} Magmatic-Hydrothermal model of platinum group element (PGE) ore deposition for PGE deposits in layered mafic intrusions such as Bushveld and Stillwater. Volatiles {{have the potential to}} complex with PGEs in silicate melts and hydrothermal fluids, increasing PGE solubility; in order to assess the models of PGE ore deposition reliable estimates on the solubilities in the various magmatic phases must be known. However, experimental studies on the solubility and partitioning behaviour of PGEs in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal systems under relevant conditions are sparse, and the data that do exist produce conflicting results and new or adapted experimental methods must be applied to investigate these systems. Experimental results are presented here, investigating the effect of volatiles (i. e. H 2 O, Cl and CO 2) on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt and fluid-melt partitioning of Pt between an aqueous fluid and a haplobasaltic melt under magmatic conditions using a sealed-capsule technique. Also included are the details of the development of a novel experimental technique to observe fluid-melt partitioning in mafic systems and application of the method to the fluid-melt partition of Pt. Solubility experiments were conducted to assess the effect of volatiles on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt of dry diopside-anorthite eutectic composition at 1523 K and 0. 2 GPa. Synthetic glass powder of an anhydrous, 1 -atm eutectic, diopside-anorthite (An 42 -Di 58) haplobasalt composition was sealed in a platinum or platinum-iridium alloy capsule and was allowed to equilibrate with the noble metal capsule and a source of volatiles (i. e. H 2 O, H 2 O-Cl or H 2 O-CO 2) at experimental conditions. All experiments were run in an internally-heated pressure vessel equipped with a rapid quench device, with oxygen fugacity controlled by the water activity and intrinsic hydrogen fugacity of the autoclave (MnO-Mn 3 O 4). The resultant crystal- and bubble-free run product glasses were analyzed using a combination of laser ablation ICP-MS and bulk solution isotope-dilution ICP-MS to determine equilibrium solubilities of Pt and Ir and investigate the formation and contribution of micronuggets to overall bulk determined concentrations. In water-bearing experiments, it was determined that water content did not have an intrinsic effect on Pt or Ir solubility for water contents between 0. 9 wt. % and 4. 4 wt. % (saturation). Water content controlled the oxygen fugacity of the experiment and the resulting variations in oxygen fugacity, and the corresponding solubilities of Pt and Ir, indicate that over geologically relevant conditions both Pt and Ir are dissolved primarily in the 2 + valence state. Pt data suggest minor influence of Pt 4 + at higher oxygen fugacities; however, {{there is no evidence of}} higher valence states for Ir. The ability of the sealed capsule technique to produce micronugget-free run product glasses in water-only experiments, allowed the solubility of Pt to be determined in hydrous haplobasalt at lower oxygen fugacities (and concentrations) then was previously observed. Pt and Ir solubility can be represented as a function of oxygen fugacity (bars) by the following equations: [Pt](ppb) = 1389 (fO-sub- 2) + 7531 (fO-sub- 2) ^(1 / 2) [Ir](ppb) = 17140 (fO-sub- 2) ^(1 / 2) In Cl-bearing experiments, experimental products from short run duration (< 96 hrs) experiments contained numerous micronuggets, preventing accurate determination of platinum and iridium solubility. Longer run duration experiments showed decreasing amounts of micronuggets, allowing accurate determination of solubility; results indicate that under the conditions studied chlorine has no discernable effect on Pt solubility in the silicate melt from 0. 6 to 2. 75 wt. % Cl (saturation). Over the same conditions, a systematic increase in Ir solubility is found with increasing Cl content; however, the observed increase is within the analytical variation/error and is therefore not conclusive. If there is an effect of Cl on PGE solubility the effect is minor resulting in increased Ir solubilities of 60 % at chlorine saturation. However, the abundance of micronuggets in short run duration experiments, which decreases in abundance with time and increases with Cl-content, offers compelling evidence that Cl-bearing fluids have the capacity to transport significant amounts of Pt and Ir under magmatic conditions. It is suggested that platinum and iridium dissolved within the Cl-bearing fluid are left behind as the fluid dissolves into the melt during the heating stages of the experiment, leaving small amounts of Pt and Ir along the former particle boundaries. With increasing run duration, the metal migrates back to the capsule walls decreasing the amount of micronuggets contained within the glass. Estimates based on this model, using mass-balance calculations on the excess amount of Pt and Ir in the run product glasses (i. e. above equilibrium solubility) in short duration experiments, indicate estimated Pt and Ir concentrations in the Cl-bearing fluid ranging from tens to a few hundred ppm, versus ppb levels in the melt. Respective apparent (equilibrium has not been established) partition coefficients (D,fluid-melt) of 1 x 10 ^ 3 to 4 x 10 ^ 3 and 300 - 1100 were determined for Pt and Ir in Cl-bearing fluids; suggesting that Cl-bearing fluids can be highly efficient at enriching and transporting PGE in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming systems. Platinum solubility was also determined as a function of CO 2 content in a hydrous haplobasalt at controlled oxygen fugacity. Using the same sealed capsule techniques and melt composition as for H 2 O and Cl, a hydrous haplobasaltic melt was allowed to equilibrate with the platinum capsule and a CO 2 -source (CaCO 3 or <b>silver</b> <b>oxalate)</b> at 1523 K and 0. 2 GPa. Experiments were conducted with a water content of approximately 1 wt. %, fixing the log oxygen fugacity (bars) between - 5. 3 and - 6. 1 (log NNO = - 6. 95 @ 1573 K and 0. 2 GPa). Carbon dioxide contents in the run product glasses ranged from 800 - 2500 ppm; and over these conditions, CO 2 was found to have a negligible effect on Pt solubility in the silicate melt. Analogous to the Cl-bearing experiments, bulk concentrations of Pt in CO 2 -bearing experiments increased with increasing CO 2 content due to micronugget formation. Apparent Pt concentrations in the H 2 O-CO 2 fluid phase, prior to fluid dissolution, were calculated to be 1. 6 to 42 ppm, resulting in apparent partition coefficients(D,fluid-melt) of 1. 5 x 10 ^ 2 to 4. 2 x 10 ^ 3, increasing with increasing mol CO 2 :H 2 O up to approximately 0. 15, after which increasing CO 2 content does not further increase partitioning. As well, a novel technique was developed and applied to assess the partitioning of Pt between an aqueous fluid and a hydrous diopside-anorthite melt under magmatic conditions. Building upon the sealed-capsule technique utilized for solubility studies, a method was developed by adding a seed crystal to the capsule along with a silicate melt and fluid. By generating conditions favourable to crystal growth, and growing the crystal from the fluid, it is possible to entrap fluid inclusions in the growing crystal, allowing direct sampling of the fluid phase at the conditions of the experiment. Using a diopside seed crystal with the diopside-anorthite eutectic melt, it was possible to control diopside crystallization by controlling the temperature, thus allowing control of the crystallization and fluid inclusion entrapment conditions. Subsequent laser ablation ICP-MS analysis of the fluid inclusions allowed fluid–melt partition coefficients of Pt to be determined. Synthetic glass powder of an anhydrous, 1 -atm eutectic, diopside-anorthite (An 42 ¬Di 58) haplobasalt composition (with ppm levels of Ba, Cs, Sr and Rb added as internal standards), water and a diopside seed crystal were sealed in a platinum capsule and were allowed to equilibrate at experimental conditions. Water was added in amounts to maintain a free fluid phase throughout the experiment, and the diopside crystal was separated from the melt. All experiments were run in an internally heated pressure vessel equipped with a rapid-quench device, with oxygen fugacity controlled by the water activity and intrinsic hydrogen fugacity of the autoclave (MnO-Mn 3 O 4). Experiments were allowed to equilibrate (6 - 48 hrs) at experimental conditions (i. e. 1498 K, 0. 2 GPa, fluid+melt+diopside stable) before temperature was dropped (i. e. to 1483 K) to induce crystallization. Crystals were allowed to grow for a period of 18 - 61 hours, prior to rapid isobaric quenching to 293 K at the conclusion of the experiment. Experimental run products were a crystal- and bubble-free glass and the diopside seed crystal with a fluid-inclusion-bearing overgrowth. Analysis of fluid inclusions provides initial solubility estimates of Pt in a H 2 O fluid phase at 1488 K and 0. 2 GPa at or near ppm levels and fluid melt partition coefficients ranging from 2 – 48. This indicates substantial metal enrichment in the fluid phase in the absence of major ligands such as carbonate or chlorine. The results of this study indicate that the volatiles studied (i. e. H 2 O, CO 2, and Cl) do not have a significant effect on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt at magmatic conditions. These results suggest that complexing of Pt and Ir by OH, Cl, and carbonate species in a haplobasaltic melt is insignificant and the presence of these volatiles will not result in significantly increased PGE contents over their dry counterparts, as has been suggested. Preliminary evidence of minor Cl-complexing of Ir is presented; however, resulting in only a slight increase (< 100 %) in Ir solubility at Cl-saturation. Significant partitioning of Pt and Ir into a fluid phase at magmatic conditions has been demonstrated; with estimates of fluid-haplobasaltic melt partition coefficients increasing from 1 x 10 ^ 1 for pure water to up to an apparent 4 x 10 ^ 3 with the addition of Cl or CO 2 to the system. This result indicates complexing of Pt and Ir with OH< HxCOy≤ Cl. Using these estimates, Cl- or CO 2 -bearing magmatic fluids can be highly efficient at enriching and transporting platinum group elements (PGEs) in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming systems...|$|E
