5|$|Bugfix releases, which {{introduce}} no {{new features}} but fix bugs. The {{third and final}} part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded {{to the city of}} Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E

5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of {{necessity}} be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} months were spent on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{never had}} a timetable, and {{operated}} according to demand. Whenever one station had a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of passengers the driver signalled to the other station {{that he was about}} to depart, and the trains from both stations would set off simultaneously, passing at the halfway crossing loop. The journey took approximately five minutes. Outside of times of peak demand the full-length trains were generally not used, and the trains used split into their two-car sections. There was no depot: trains were stabled in the lower section of the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation {{on the number of}} endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{more than}} 340 of the village's 1,830 {{residents}} {{served in the}} United States Armed Forces. The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward. Such a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of firefighters was serving the armed forces that the village requested volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department; at least nine served on active duty {{during the war and}} had the ability to excuse themselves from school (which was then located adjacent to Law Memorial Park) if the fire siren went off. Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the existing equipment. One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt. Arthur J. Quinn, Jr. of the 45th Division was killed in action in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful immunotherapy is to rapidly generate <b>sufficient</b> <b>numbers</b> of CAR-modified cells in vitro, which requires {{at least one}} million cells for expansion ex vivo. In general, there are <b>sufficient</b> <b>numbers</b> of NK cells that can be directly isolated from peripheral human blood. Around 10 %– 15 % of PBMCs in the buffy coat layer are CD 3 -negative and CD 56 -positive NK cells. We usually can isolate between 10 – 20 million NK cells per buffy coat layer in each healthy individual. Immobilized apheresis products contain 5 %– 15 % NK cells. To isolate NK cells, CD 3 + cell depletion of PBMCs is commonly performed, followed by CD 56 + cell enrichment using immunomagnetic bead separation with medical devices and clinical-grade reagents; these methods are feasibly conducted in the clinic due to the <b>sufficient</b> <b>numbers</b> of NK cells that can be isolated directly from peripheral blood.|$|R

5|$|In 1897, Garran {{published}} The Coming Commonwealth, {{an influential}} {{book on the}} history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of coins {{have been found to}} show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E

5|$|The reverse design had in 1895 been {{modified}} by Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. Following Queen Victoria's death in 1901, de Saulles was {{called upon to}} create a design for the obverse featuring Edward VII. This appeared on the penny in 1902, and remained in use until the year of King Edward's death, 1910. An obverse design by Sir Bertram Mackennal depicting George V went into use in 1911, and remained with some modification until {{the year of the}} King's death, 1936. No pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, as there were a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> in circulation. At least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; they are valuable today. Edward VIII's short reign is only represented by a single pattern coin, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design depicting George VI by Humphrey Paget went into use. During the Second World War period of 1941 to 1943, pennies were struck only for the colonies; these are all dated 1940, the most recent year of production for the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for the penny began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, with many retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.|$|E
5|$|Varaždin was the {{garrison}} of the JNA 32nd Corps commanded by Major General Vladimir Trifunović. In {{addition to the}} Corps headquarters there were several other JNA facilities {{in and around the}} city. The most substantial of these were located in Varaždin itself – the Kalnički partizani barracks where Colonel Berislav Popov's 32nd Mechanised Brigade was based, and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks of the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Davidović. The Corps' area of responsibility extended beyond Varaždin and its immediate surroundings, where further significant combat units were based. The most significant among them were the 32nd Engineer Regiment in Čakovec, the 411th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment based in Križevci, the 73rd Motorised Brigade headquartered in Koprivnica, the 265th Mechanised Brigade based in Bjelovar, and the 288th Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade in Virovitica. In Varaždin itself, the JNA units included approximately 1,000 troops, making the JNA garrison of Varaždin the second largest in Croatia. Despite this, the JNA did not have <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of troops in the area to secure all its facilities.|$|E
25|$|The board {{found that}} the crew and {{passengers}} had not jumped immediately from the aircraft owing to several factors, including a loss of altitude while attempting to find an emergency field, the rapidly spreading fire, which blocked or impeded egress from the plane, {{and the fact that}} a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of parachutes were either not on board or were not being worn. Almost immediately following the crash, Prime Minister Churchill issued a directive requiring any test flights with civilians or scientific personnel to carry a <b>sufficient</b> <b>number</b> of parachutes for all individuals involved.|$|E
