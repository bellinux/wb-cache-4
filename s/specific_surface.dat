25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area. The <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} double-layer {{as well as}} pseudocapacitance stored per unit voltage in a {{supercapacitor}} is predominantly {{a function of the}} electrode surface area. Therefore, supercapacitor electrodes are typically made of porous, spongy material with an extraordinarily high <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area, such as activated carbon. Additionally, the ability of the electrode material to perform faradaic charge transfers enhances the total capacitance.|$|E
25|$|CNTs {{can store}} {{about the same}} charge as {{activated}} carbon per unit surface area, but nanotubes' surface is arranged in a regular pattern, providing greater wettability. SWNTs have a high theoretical <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area of 1315m2/g, while that for MWNTs is lower and {{is determined by the}} diameter of the tubes and degree of nesting, compared with a surface area of about 3000 m2/g of activated carbons. Nevertheless, CNTs have higher capacitance than activated carbon electrodes, e.g., 102F/g for MWNTs and 180F/g for SWNTs.|$|E
40|$|Processing {{of powder}} {{metallurgical}} components {{is related to}} high <b>specific</b> <b>surfaces,</b> in particular in the first stages of the process. Thus, high <b>specific</b> <b>surfaces</b> give rise to carbonization and oxidation during debinding and sintering due to reactions with degradation products of binders and additives. Since measurements in the furnace exhaust system may lead to ambiguous results, {{the objective of the}} present work is to observe reactions of PM components with the process atmosphere directly in the furnace. Therefore, in-situ FTIR gas phase measurements of the debinding and sintering of PM steel components were performed in reducing atmospheres. The results show the composition of the degradation products in the low temperature region 500 °C. With such informations, temperature and dwell time schedules may be optimized. As a conclusion, it is shown that in-situ monitoring of the gas phase composition in sintering furnaces is a strong instrument for the improvement of PM processes...|$|R

25|$|The {{activity}} (A) of a soil is the PI {{divided by}} the percent of clay-sized particles (less than 2 μm) present. Different types of clays have different <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> areas which controls how much wetting is required to move a soil from one phase to another such as across the liquid limit or the plastic limit. From the activity, one can predict the dominant clay type present in a soil sample. High activity signifies large volume change when wetted and large shrinkage when dried. Soils with high activity are very reactive chemically.|$|E
25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day compressive strength equal to the seven-day compressive strength of types I and II. Its seven-day compressive strength is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only downside is that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic charge {{acceptance}} (DCA) of modern lead-carbon batteries {{is one of}} the key parameters for their future application in micro- and mild-hybrid cars. This work elucidates the impact of the external surface area of carbon additives on the electrochemical performance of lead-carbon electrodes with respect to the DCA. Five specially synthesized amorphous hard carbon powders with different <b>specific</b> external <b>surface</b> area ranging from 13 m 2 g− 1 to 192 m 2 g− 1 were added to the negative active material of laboratory lead-carbon test cells. Results from cyclic voltammetry reveal that the <b>specific</b> external <b>surface</b> area of amorphous carbons exhibits a clear correlation to the electrochemical activity of lead-carbon electrodes. Firstly, an almost linear increase of the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction with increasing <b>specific</b> external <b>surface</b> area of the carbon additive can be found. Secondly, the specific double-layer capacity of the negative active material is directly linked to the <b>specific</b> external <b>surface</b> area of the additive, as well. Thirdly, a clear correlation to the DCA can be established. In conclusion, a high <b>specific</b> external carbon <b>surface</b> in the negative active material seems to be a key to improve the dynamic {{charge acceptance}} of modern lead-carbon batteries...|$|R

BN aerogels are highly hydrophobic and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted chemical vapor deposition using borazine as the feed gas.|$|E

Contrary to current assumptions concerning these two products, both AFM and adsorption/desorption of N 2 at 77 K and of CO 2 at 273 K show that these two imogolites are polydisperse and heterogeneous in terms of length and inner and outer diameter. An analysis of adsorption clearly shows that N 2 is limited to the characterization of porosities between 1 and 50 nm and that CO 2 is better-suited to the analysis of ultramicropores (< 1 nm). The <b>specific</b> <b>surfaces</b> of micropores estimated with N 2 are greatly underestimated.

2500|$|Nutritional {{stress can}} change {{bacterial}} morphology. [...] A common shape alteration is filamentation {{which can be}} triggered by a limited availability {{of one or more}} substrates, nutrients or electron acceptors. Since the filament can increase a cell’s uptake–surface area without significantly changing its volume appreciably. [...] Moreover, the filamentation benefits bacterial cells attaching to a surface because it increases <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area in direct contact with the solid medium. In addition, the filamentation may allows bacterial cells to access nutrients by enhancing the possibility that part of the filament will contact a nutrient-rich zone and pass compounds {{to the rest of the}} cell’s biomass.
