5|$|Released {{as part of}} a shift by Microsoft towards regular yearly major updates for its {{software}} platforms and services, Windows 8.1 aims to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Visible enhancements include an improved <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11, a Bing-powered unified search system, restoration of a visible Start button on the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> Windows 8.1 also added support for such emerging technologies as high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file system.|$|E
5|$|After {{installation}} of the KB3033055 update for Windows RT 8.1, a desktop Start menu becomes available {{as an alternative to}} <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> It is divided into two columns, with one devoted to recent and pinned applications, and one devoted to live tiles. It is similar to, but not identical to, Windows 10's version.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the <b>start</b> <b>screen</b> many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
2500|$|Women {{should wait}} {{a few years after}} they first have {{intercourse}} before they <b>start</b> <b>screening,</b> and should not be screened before age 21. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend <b>starting</b> <b>screening</b> at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women). [...] Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to <b>start</b> <b>screening.</b> For instance, some parts of Great Britain <b>start</b> <b>screening</b> at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that people with uteruses age 30–65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, and that they do get Pap tests at three-year intervals.|$|R

25|$|Windows 8.1 {{addressed}} {{a number of}} criticisms faced by Windows 8 upon its release, with additional customization options for the <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> the restoration of a visible Start button on the desktop, the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display, {{and the ability to}} boot to the desktop instead of the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> Windows 8's stock apps were also updated, a new Bing-based unified search system was added, SkyDrive was given deeper integration with the operating system, and a number of new stock apps, along with a tutorial, were added. Windows 8.1 also added support for 3D printing, Miracast media streaming, NFC printing, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
25|$|Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 were {{released}} on October 17, 2013. Windows 8.1 is available as an update in the Windows store for Windows 8 users only and also available to download for clean installation. The update adds new options for resizing the live tiles on the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> {{no longer}} {{supports}} several previously available features. A list of recently launched program or shortcuts to special folders no longer {{appears on the}} <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> It no longer supports more than one level of nesting for groups in All Programs view. Drag and drop support for adding new items to the menu as well as reorganizing the contents of All Programs view is no longer available. In addition, {{for the first time}} in the history of Windows, the Start menu in a stock installation of Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 does not provide any facility for shutting down, restarting or activating sleep mode or hibernation, forcing users to use the settings button in the charms bar to perform these actions. An April 2014 update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restores the latter.|$|E

25|$|The Start menu is a user {{interface}} element used in Microsoft Windows since Windows 95 {{and in some}} other operating systems. It provides a central launching point for computer programs and performing other tasks. It has different names in different operating systems and window managers, such as Kickoff Application Launcher in KDE, Dash in GNOME and Unity, and <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> in Windows 8.|$|E
25|$|A {{vertical}} toolbar {{known as}} the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button. The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has {{been converted into a}} hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 {{is similar to that of}} Windows 7.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 2012, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 8 to the public. One edition, Windows RT, runs on some system-on-a-chip devices with mobile 32-bit ARM (ARMv7) processors. Windows 8 {{features a}} redesigned user interface, {{designed to make}} it easier for touchscreen users to use Windows. The interface introduced an updated Start menu known as the <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> and a new full-screen application platform. The desktop interface is also present for running windowed applications, although Windows RT will not run any desktop applications not included in the system. On the Building Windows 8 blog, it was announced that a computer running Windows 8 can boot up much faster than Windows 7. New features also include USB 3.0 support, the Windows Store, the ability to run from USB drives with Windows To Go, and others. Windows 8 was given the kernel number NT 6.2, with its successor 8.1 receiving the kernel number 6.3. So far, neither has had any service packs yet, although many consider Windows 8.1 to be a service pack for Windows 8.|$|E

25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E
500|$|To {{improve the}} {{usability}} of the desktop interface, a visible Start button was {{restored to the}} taskbar for opening the <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> and the Quick Links menu (accessed by right-clicking the Start button or pressing [...] ) now contains shutdown and sign-out options. Users can also modify certain user interface behaviors, such as disabling the upper hot corners for using the charms and recent apps list, going to the desktop instead of the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> on login or after closing all apps on a screen, automatically opening the [...] "All Apps" [...] view on the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> when opened, and prioritizing desktop programs on the [...] "Category" [...] sort mode on [...] "All Apps". To assist users in learning the Windows 8 user interface, an interactive tutorial is also offered, along with a new Help + Tips app for additional information. In contrast, Windows RT 8.1 downplays the desktop interface further by not displaying the Desktop tile on its default <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> at all (however, it can still be manually added to the <b>Start</b> <b>screen).</b>|$|E
500|$|Further {{interface}} behavior {{changes are}} made on the April 2014 [...] "Windows 8.1 Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> uses context menus instead of a toolbar {{across the bottom of}} the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding title bar with minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop programs and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and power buttons are added to the <b>Start</b> <b>screen.</b> In non-touch environments, the default image viewer and media player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.|$|E
50|$|Once all treasures {{have been}} collected, the player must escape {{back to the}} <b>starting</b> <b>screen.</b> Subsequently, they receive a level {{password}} and the game restarts in a higher of the four difficulty levels.|$|R

500|$|The Aurelien and Florian Marrel [...] {{directed}} video {{begins with}} {{a shot of the}} band reflected in a television screen then cuts to the <b>start</b> <b>screen</b> of a fictional video game called 'Lazer Beam' which claims to have been made by the Kocakatpiece Corporation in 2005. 'Arcade mode' is selected then two characters are chosen from a menu featuring four Super Furry Animals band member lookalikes before a brief 'How to play' screen is shown.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down arrow button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E
500|$|Group Policy {{has a new}} [...] "Policy Cache" [...] setting {{which allows}} domain-joined {{machines}} to store {{a copy of the}} group policy settings on the client machine and, depending on the speed of access to the domain controller, use those at startup time instead of waiting for the policy settings to download. This can improve startup times on machines that are disconnected from the company network. [...] New Group Policy settings have been added to cover new features in Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11, such as enabling/disabling SPDY/3 support, configuring <b>start</b> <b>screen</b> layouts, and detecting phone numbers in web pages.|$|E
2500|$|According to the 2010 European guidelines, the age {{at which}} to <b>start</b> <b>screening</b> ranges between 20 and 30 years of age, [...] "but {{preferentially}} not before age 25 or 30 years", and depends on burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.|$|R

500|$|Peter Bright of Ars Technica praised {{many of the}} {{improvements}} on Windows 8.1, such as its more [...] "complete" [...] touch interface, the [...] "reasonable" [...] tutorial content, the new autocomplete tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E
500|$|Windows 8.1 {{received}} more positive reviews than Windows 8. Tom Warren of The Verge still considered the platform to be a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{due to the}} number of apps available, the impaired level of capabilities that apps have in comparison to desktop programs, and because he felt that mouse and keyboard navigation was still [...] "awkward". However, he touted many of the major changes on Windows 8.1, such as the expanded snapping functionality, increased <b>Start</b> <b>screen</b> customization, SkyDrive and Bing integration, improvements to stock apps, and particularly he considered the Mail app to be [...] "lightyears ahead" [...] of the original version from 8. He concluded that [...] "Microsoft has achieved a lot within 12 months, even a lot of the additions feel like they should have been there from the very start with Windows 8." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Build conference, during April, Microsoft's Terry Myerson {{unveiled}} further {{user interface}} changes for Windows 8.1, including {{the ability to}} run Metro-style apps inside desktop windows, and a revised Start menu, which creates a compromise between the Start menu design used by Windows 7 and the <b>Start</b> <b>screen,</b> by combining the application listing in the first column with a second {{that can be used}} to display app tiles. Myerson stated that these changes would occur in a future update, but did not elaborate further. Microsoft also unveiled a concept known as [...] "Universal Windows apps", in which a Windows Runtime app can be ported to Windows Phone 8.1 and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase. While it does not entirely unify Windows' app ecosystem with that of Windows Phone, it will allow developers to synchronize data between versions of their app on each platform, and bundle access to Windows, Windows Phone, and Xbox One versions of an app in a single purchase.|$|E
