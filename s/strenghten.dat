40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} a Josephson junction consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor (FI-S) bilayer tunnel-coupled to a superconducting electrode. We show that the Josephson coupling in the structure is <b>strenghtened</b> by the presence of the spin-splitting field induced in the FI-S bilayer. Such <b>strenghtening</b> manifests itself as an increase of the critical current $I_c$ with the amplitude of the exchange field. Furthermore, the effect can be strongly enhanced if the junction is taken out of equilibrium by a temperature bias. We propose a realistic setup to assess experimentally the magnitude of the induced exchange field, and predict a drastic deviation of the $I_c(T) $ curve ($T$ is the temperature) with respect to equilibrium.
