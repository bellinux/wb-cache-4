25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually <b>smooth</b> <b>release.</b> A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E

5000|$|James Kozanitis from Game Revolution {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 4 out of 5 stars saying that [...] "Tekken will always have a place among todays {{fighting}} games, but {{it will always be}} its own place, and Tekken 7 is the best embodiment of that mentality. Theyve made very little effort to conform to what other fighting games have taken for granted, even down to Tekken 7s use of 3D arenas where most fighters conformed to a 2D battlefield years ago. Rather than getting hit by typical fighting game tropes, Tekken 7 was able to sidestep them. But its the ways in which Tekken 7 can still feel fresh despite its classic formula that set it apart from the pack. Even in the few concessions Tekken 7 did make to become more traditional, it did so with its own flair. Its <b>smooth</b> <b>release</b> on PC only goes to bolster the fact that the Tekken series will be around for quite some time, doing its own thing and doing it well.|$|E

Now, the {{producers}} start searching for a distributor and meet Ontikannu Gavarraju (Kota Srinivasa Rao), but he wants the promos in a different manner with lots of exposure of heroine and the hero in an attractive manner. But Appalaraju refuses to change the promos. Gavarraju refuses to distribute the film first but changes his mind after meeting Babugaru and agrees to take distribution rights across the state. In the last minutes, Gavarraju cheats the producer and refuses to release the film. Again, Rakhee and Appalaraju meet Database to distribute the film and he accepts their proposal.

The Movie ends with Appalaraju and Swati dancing for the remix of the Item song used in the film.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new control strategy {{to enhance the}} ability of reactive power support of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine during serious voltage dips. The proposed strategy is an advanced {{low voltage ride through}} (LVRT) control scheme, with which a part of the captured wind energy during grid faults is stored temporarily in the rotor's inertia energy and the remaining energy is available to the grid while the DC-link voltage and rotor current are kept below the dangerous levels. After grid fault clearance, the control strategy ensures <b>smooth</b> <b>release</b> of the rotor's excessive inertia energy into the grid. Based on these designs, the DFIG's reactive power capacity on the stator and the grid side converter is handled carefully to satisfy the new grid code requirements strictly.

40|$|The {{different}} {{steps in}} the dissolution process of polydisperse polymers in water have been studied. To that end, poly(ethylene oxide), dextran and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose tablets varying widely in polydispersity have been produced by mixing low molecular weight and high molecular weight samples in different proportions. The individual release of the low and high molecular weight fractions has been monitored and the swelling of the so-called gel layer, {{as well as the}} disappearance of the solid core, of selected tablet compositions have been followed during the dissolution process. Moreover, the release rates of the mixed tablets have been compared to the release rates of less polydisperse tablets. Even though the swelling and the release rate varied dramatically between the tablets of different polymer type, they all shared the same release behaviour; They all developed a gel layer, they all showed <b>smooth</b> <b>release</b> curves with similar shapes and the low and the high molecular weight fractions were released at the same rate for all tablets. Furthermore, corresponding tablets, that is tablets with the same release rate differing widely in polydispersity, showed similar swelling behaviours and shared the same viscosity versus concentration behaviour. Based on these results a physical picture is presented of the polymer dissolution process where the polymer release is described in terms of a threshold viscosity at the gel layer surface. Furthermore, the polymer release from the tablets is shown to correlate with the inverse of the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer in the tablet...|$|E
