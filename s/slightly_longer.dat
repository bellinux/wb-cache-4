5|$|Finally, the Moon's perigee {{is moving}} {{forwards}} or precessing in its orbit {{and makes a}} complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month.|$|E
5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from the Sun is roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E
50|$|Fist {{unveiled}} at IDEF 2013, the Cobra II {{is a more}} heavily-armored {{successor to}} the Cobra. The Cobra II has a combat weight that is roughly double that of its predecessor and is <b>slightly</b> wider, <b>longer</b> and taller.|$|R

5000|$|Framing chisel: usually {{used with}} mallet; {{similar to a}} butt chisel, except it has a <b>longer,</b> <b>slightly</b> {{flexible}} blade.|$|R
5|$|The other subspecies, sclateri, has <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> {{wings and}} a smaller bill. The plumage is less golden, with the {{forehead}} and uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and with both the wings and tail being blue-black. The underparts of T. e. sclateri also vary in being pure white without streaks.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than the Sublette, but {{had the advantage of}} only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E

5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|German {{zoologist}} and botanist Peter Simon Pallas originally {{described the}} alpine pika in 1773, {{in his work}} Reise durch verschiedene Provinzen des Russischen Reichs. It is a large species in the pika family, Ochotonidae, which consists of small mammals that have short ears, forelimbs very <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than hindlimbs, and no external tail. There are four recognised subspecies: O. a. alpina (Pallas, 1773), O. a. cinereofusca (Schrenk, 1858), O. a. sushkini (Thomas, 1924), and O. a. changaica (Ognev, 1940).|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, Polydor only {{released}} the album on both CD and cassette, {{whereas in the}} US, Geffen also released it on vinyl LP. For the 2014 reissue, an unreleased and <b>slightly</b> different <b>longer</b> version of [...] "New Skin" [...] was included as a bonus track (the original version had been released in 1995 on the soundtrack for the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls).|$|R

5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were <b>slightly</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, sound more like voiceless stops in English, but are <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Stadtbahn ("city railway") is a {{major railway}} {{thoroughfare}} in the German capital Berlin, which runs through Berlin from east to west. It connects the eastern district of Friedrichshain with Charlottenburg in the west via 11 intermediate stations including Hauptbahnhof. The Berlin Stadtbahn is often also defined as the <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> route between Ostkreuz and Westkreuz, although this is not technically correct.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} aircraft were designated the V-1A {{and had a}} <b>slightly</b> larger and <b>longer</b> fuselage for two pilots and eight passengers. Production ended in 1936 after 24 aircraft plus the prototype had been built.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to Lygus wagneri, but usually it is <b>slightly</b> larger, has <b>longer</b> {{membrane}} and a more densely pubescent corium. It is also quite similar to Lygus maritimus and Lygus rugulipennis.|$|R
50|$|Several {{populations have}} been named. The central Indian {{subspecies}} legerli, named by Walter Norman Koelz {{on the basis}} of a single specimen obtained from the foot of Mahendra Giri in Orissa is not always recognized, but said to be <b>slightly</b> larger, <b>longer</b> winged and brighter than malabaricus of the Western Ghats. The nominate race found in the central wet zone of Sri Lanka is smaller and the upperparts are brighter.|$|R
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than three months.|$|E
50|$|Lahori Gogona(লাহৰি গগণা) {{is made to}} fit a woman's hand, so it is <b>slightly</b> slimmer and <b>longer</b> {{than the}} Ramdhan Gogona. It is {{generally}} tucked into a hair knot while performing the vibrant Bihu dance.|$|R
40|$|Far-IR {{spectra of}} Venus, Mars and Jupiter between 46 and 115 microns have been {{obtained}} at a resolving power of about 10, observing from the NASA Lear Jet {{at an altitude of}} 13. 7 km. The results are calibrated with lunar observations and show Mars and Venus to have relatively constant brightness temperatures over this wavelength region, with Venus appearing somewhat warmer at longer wavelengths. The brightness temperature of Jupiter decreases <b>slightly</b> toward <b>longer</b> wavelengths...|$|R
50|$|The W84 is 13 in in {{diameter}} and 34 in long, <b>slightly</b> wider and <b>longer</b> than the W80 warhead used on air-launched and submarine-launched cruise missiles. It weighs 388 lb, almost 100 lb pounds heavier than the W80.|$|R
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|The Karlsruhe {{class of}} light cruisers {{was a pair}} of two ships built for the German Imperial Navy before the start of World War I. The ships and were very similar to the {{previous}} s, mounting the same armament and similar armor protection, though they were larger and faster than the earlier ships. Both vessels were laid down in 1911, and launched one day apart, on 11 and 12 November 1912. Karlsruhe joined the fleet in January 1914, but fitting out work lasted <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> on her sister; Rostock was commissioned the following month.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Etna-class {{protected}} cruisers was based on that of Sir W G Armstrong Mitchell & Co.'s Elswick Works' earlier Giovanni Bausan, {{which was the first}} modern protected cruiser constructed for the Italian Navy. She proved successful enough that the Italians negotiated for a license to build copies in Italian shipyards. George Rendel and Carlo Vigna designed the ships. The first three ships varied somewhat in their displacement and engine power, and the last ship, Ettore Fieramosca, was <b>slightly</b> <b>longer</b> than the others.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the DOX uptake in MCF- 7 cells {{incubated}} with DOX-NBs was <b>slightly</b> increased upon <b>longer</b> irradiation time. This {{may be due}} to {{an increased}} rupture of DOX-NBs, generating transient pores on the membranes of MCF- 7 cells.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two teams}} {{played with the}}ir {{respective}} footballs from each league; the Chiefs used the AFL ball, the <b>slightly</b> narrower and <b>longer</b> J5V by Spalding, and the Packers played with the NFL ball, [...] "The Duke" [...] by Wilson.|$|R
