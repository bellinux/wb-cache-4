As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

40|$|A {{thermally}} mature palynomorph assemblage containing <b>significant</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristic dinoflagellate cyst Liasidium variabile Drugg 1978 {{was recovered}} from the Lower Jurassic Pabay Shale Formation of southwest Raasay. This is <b>the</b> first record <b>of</b> this biostratigraphically important species from <b>the</b> Jurassic <b>of</b> onshore Scotland. Liasidium variabile is a zonal index for the Late Sinemurian in northwest Europe, and this occurrence allows a correlation to <b>the</b> Oxynotum Zone <b>of</b> this substage. This is the first evidence for this chronozone on Raasay. Furthermore, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> morphotypes A and B of Liasidium variabile indicates a probable correlation to <b>the</b> Oxynotum Subzone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oxynotum Zone. This interpretation is not consistent with a hiatus within the Upper Sinemurian succession on Raasay...|$|R
5|$|Historical {{reaction}} to the battle {{has focused on the}} significantly stronger British position in the encounter, with three large regular warships pitted against a hastily converted merchant vessel with a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew suffering from illness. Duguay-Trouin was also weakly built and weakly armed: early estimates that the Duguay Trouins main battery mounted twenty-six 18-pounder long guns were revised to 12-pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck. The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year, with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October. Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict, the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796.|$|E
5|$|Some species live separately, in {{vertical}} tubes {{embedded in}} soft sediment, while others form tangled masses buried in or encrusting rocks and shells. In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter. The actinotroch larvae are familiar among plankton, and sometimes {{account for a}} <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zooplankton biomass. Predators include fish, gastropods (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). One phoronid species is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators. Various parasites infest phoronids' body cavities, digestive tract and tentacles. It is unknown whether phoronids have any significance for humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E

5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to consume a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with {{both the state and}} with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It {{can be divided into}} the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
5|$|Hastily deployed, {{the first}} {{contingent}} of AIF was essentially untrained and suffered from widespread equipment shortages. In early 1915 the AIF was largely an inexperienced force, {{with only a}} small percentage of its members having previous combat experience. However, many officers and non-commissioned personnel (NCOs) had previously served in the pre-war permanent or part-time forces, and a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enlisted personnel had received some basic military instruction as part of Australia's compulsory training scheme. Predominantly a fighting force based on infantry battalions and light horse regiments, the AIF had a high proportion of close combat troops to support personnel. Nevertheless, the AIF eventually included a large number of logistics and administrative units which were capable of meeting most of the force's needs, and in some circumstances provided support to nearby allied units. Each division also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. Corps troops included light horse, army artillery, and cyclists. Regardless, the AIF mainly relied on the British Army for medium and heavy artillery support and other weapons systems necessary for combined arms warfare that were developed later in the war, including aircraft and tanks.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} explanations of women’s partner aggression {{in a sample}} of 358 women. Women completed measures of physical aggression, control, and fear. Three explanations of women’s partner aggression were explored: (a) that its use is associated with fear, (b) that it is reciprocal, and (c) that it is coercive. Each explanation received partial support, with multivariate analysis showing that collectively they explained <b>significant</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variance in women’s self-reported use of physical aggression toward their male partners. These results indicate that women’s physical aggression toward male partners cannot be understood using a unitary explanation. There is a research tradition that assumes that women are only victims of relationship violence and never or rarely perpetrators (e. g., Dobash, Dobash, Cavanagh, & Lewis, 1998).

5|$|Most Indonesians {{lived in}} fear and uncertainty, {{particularly}} a <b>significant</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless {{in their efforts to}} stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the wheelhouse}} complex has been dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries.
