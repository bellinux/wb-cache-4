5|$|These alleles do {{not account}} for all dominantly {{inherited}} white spotting in horses. More KIT alleles {{are expected to be}} found with roles in white spotting. Most W alleles each occur within a specific breed or family and arise as spontaneous mutations. The KIT gene itself seems prone to mutation, and <b>so</b> <b>new</b> alleles of W could occur in virtually any breed.|$|E
5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were <b>so</b> <b>new</b> that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, <b>so</b> <b>new</b> clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was <b>so</b> <b>new,</b> there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta {{still had}} three test assemblies, F101, F102 and F103, but the damaged F32 was unserviceable, <b>so</b> <b>new</b> {{explosive}} blocks {{would have to}} be flown in from Project Camel. There were also shortages of some components, notably detonator chimneys. These were fabricated on Tinian. Seven B-29s of the 509th Composite Group flew Pumpkin bomb missions on 14 August. Word that Japan had surrendered reached Tinian the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Beaufort was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, <b>so</b> <b>new</b> tactics had to be {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single Beaufort.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and <b>so</b> <b>new</b> slave states should not be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E
5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, <b>so</b> <b>New</b> Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
