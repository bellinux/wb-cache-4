5|$|Stewart led on the restart; On {{the next}} lap, the sixth caution was given as Jeff Burton spun <b>sideways.</b> <b>At</b> the lap 180 restart, Stewart was the leader, ahead of Johnson, Newman, Earnhardt and Hamlin. On the next lap, Johnson claimed the lead through turn one, while Sam Hornish, Jr. {{went to his}} garage due to oil issues. Two laps later, Earnhardt and Montoya moved up into third and fifth {{positions}} respectively. Five laps later, Montoya passed McMurray for the fourth position; Earnhardt passed Stewart for second. By the 190th lap, Johnson had a lead of three seconds, while Montoya passed Stewart for third. On lap 193, Allmendinger made contact with Stremme who spun into the wall at turn two, prompting the seventh caution. Most of the leaders made pit stops during the caution. Kurt Busch became the leader by the lap 197 restart, from Martin and Sadler.|$|E
5|$|Menard {{remained}} leading, as Bowyer and Burton {{moved to}} {{the third and fourth}} positions on lap53. On the following lap, they moved to first and second after passing Menard. On lap 57, the sixth caution was given after Brian Vickers' car stalled. The front runners made pit stops during the caution, as McMurray and Montoya reclaimed the first two positions at the restart. On lap61, Johnson returned to the race after his team repaired the car in the garage. Also on the same lap, Ku. Busch overtook McMurray to become the leader, as both McMurray and Montoya fell to the 17th and 18th positions. On the 63rd lap, Logano, with assistance from Stewart, moved into the fifth position, as Kasey Kahne moved to tenth. By lap65, Logano and Stewart had fallen to seventh and eighth. On the next lap, Burton moved into the first position. On the 67th lap, Keselowski moved to third, as Smith became the leader. Smith remained the leader until lap72 when Jeff Burton and Bowyer passed him. By lap73, the race had 26 lead changes. On the following lap, Burton passed Bowyer for the first position. Three laps later, Kvapil prompted the caution after spinning <b>sideways.</b> <b>At</b> the lap78 restart, Bowyer was the leader ahead of Earnhardt, Jr. in second.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{attempted}} to replicate his earlier overtaking manoeuvre on Sette Cãmara {{but was not}} successful. Yamashita and Ilott made {{contact with each other}} but the Japanese driver was able to move into fourth place after passing Ilott. Sette Cãmara slid <b>sideways</b> <b>at</b> Fisherman's Bend corner, allowing Rosenqvist to get into the slipstream of the Brazilian driver. Rosenqvist went to the outside line and passed Sette Cãmara driving into Lisboa corner to move into second place. Piquet collided with Ticktum, ending the Double R Racing driver's race while MacLeod went wide off the track in order to avoid a multi-car accident. Rosenqvist began catching Félix da Costa by setting the race's fastest lap on lap 14, completing a circuit of two minutes and 11.080 seconds, but was unable to get close to the Portuguese driver, though yellow flags were waved for Maini who drove straight at Lisboa corner. Félix da Costa controlled the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch the victory. It was the second Macau Grand Prix win of Félix da Costa's career. Rosenqvist finished in second place, 1.603 seconds behind, with Sette Cãmara in third, Yamashita fourth and Ilott fifth. Hughes, Russell, Juncadella, Piquet and Sims completed the top ten finishers. The race had two yellow flag periods and two lead changes among two different drivers. Félix da Costa led once for a total of nine laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

25|$|Magnussen {{made a good}} getaway off the grid, {{moving to}} sixth, which {{involved}} passing Massa outside of track limits at the fifth corner, but later slid <b>sideways</b> <b>at</b> turn seven while fending off teammate Button which dropped him to ninth. Button made the best start in the field, gaining four positions {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Rosberg's pit lane start meant he lost 21 positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Hamilton led from Vettel, Alonso, Ricciardo, Räikkönen, Massa, Button, Bottas, Magnussen and Kvyat. Alonso's start was investigated by the stewards but elected to take no further action against the driver. Rosberg left the pit lane on the second lap but was initially unable to maintain the pace of Chilton's Marussia. DRS was enabled on the third lap as the field spread out and Magnussen was investigated by the stewards for going beyond track limits. McLaren teammates Magnussen and Button avoided colliding with each other on lap four and the result meant they fell behind both Williams cars. Vettel kept Hamilton's lead advantage constant, prompting the latter to increase his pace by going half a second faster than Vettel while conserving fuel.Rosberg overtook Chilton to move into 20th on lap five, while Kvyat was told over his radio to battle Magnussen after going three-tenths of a second faster than Magnussen in the first sector on the following lap. Rosberg was not able to overtake Ericsson and was more than 40 seconds behind race leader Hamilton by the same lap. It was announced on the seventh lap that no further action against Magnussen was necessitated. Magnussen, Kvyat and Vergne were within one second of each other and battle for ninth place. Vergne encouraged his team get teammate Kvyat to cede a position to him but Kvyat insisted he had the pace to get past Magnussen. Kvyat lost tenth place to teammate Vergne on lap eight and the latter began gaining on Magnussen. Rosberg was only able to shift gears two at any one point and was five seconds slower than teammate Hamilton. Hamilton led the field by five seconds by the start of lap ten despite having balance problems with his car over the space of one lap. Massa ran closely behind Räikkönen by the time of his first pit stop at the end of lap ten as part of a plan by the Williams team to undercut the second Ferrari car. Räikkönen made his stop on the following lap and emerged behind Massa.|$|E

500|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. As in 2012, qualifying {{was divided}} into two groups of thirteen cars, with the odd numbered vehicles in Group A and the even numbered cars in Group B. The starting order was determined by the fastest overall driver in either group. Most cars had the soft types equipped at the start of qualifying and most made pit stops for set-up alterations with some having supersoft tyres installed. Cecotto clinched his first pole position of the season, the second of his career, and his second in Monte Carlo with a time of one minute and 21.141 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Evans who topped Group B but his best time set at the end of qualifying was 0.016 seconds slower than Cecotto and Evans's effort was not enough to earn him pole position. On his final timed lap, Bird was fastest in the first sector, but lost six tenths of a second in the final two sectors and could only muster third. Leimer drifted <b>sideways</b> <b>at</b> the final corner on his fastest lap but did not make contact with the barrier en route to fourth place. Kevin Ceccon took fifth. Palmer's first attempt at going faster proved unsuccessful as he came across Richelmi in the final sector but took it at his next attempt before Leimer demoted him down the order. Palmer eventually took sixth.|$|E

The diesel-electric propulsion with two Siemens Schottel Z-drive thrusters and two bow thrusters allows the ship to maneuver and even move <b>sideways</b> <b>at</b> low speeds, considerably increasing the oil recovery rate.|$|E
