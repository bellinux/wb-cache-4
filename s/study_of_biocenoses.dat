The comprehensive <b>study</b> <b>of</b> littoral <b>biocenoses</b> allows reveal interrelation of benthic organisms with the vegetable substrate where they inhabit. The aim of the work is the investigation of structure and distribution features of epibenthic communities on the littoral macrophytes of the Chupa inlet (the White Sea). The investigations were conducted at The White Sea Biological Station "Kartesh" (WSBS) during the summer period of three years (2012 – 2015). The material was being collected on the intertidal zone of the Levaya bay, Kruglaya bay, and Sel'dyanaya bay of the Chupa inlet by the method of vertical transects using the accounting frame (0. 25 m 2) in the three-fold repetition. In the processing of samples, the abundance of algae and epibionts has been defined; the biomass and number of macrophytes and invertebrates have been measured. In the course of the work, it has been revealed that Fucus algae create a favorable habitat for epibenthos including moving animals. A variety of seaweed substrates contributes to increase of invertebrates' biomass. The only exceptions are parts of the bays, where seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum and Pelvetia caniculata are abundant. These algae are not favourable substrate for most of epibenthic organisms and serve as habitat mainly of sedentary invertebrates due to the morphology of the thallus. Mussels Mytilus edulis are dominant invertebrates in the communities, where Fucus is the substrate. Filamentous algae contribute to active development of Hydrobia ulvae communities...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{extensive}} research during the 70 s, sequencing batch reactors (SBR) {{have become a}} quite common modification of activated sludge process.

While several comparative studies between the two systems were done in terms of organic carbon and nutrients removal efficiency, a detailed comparison <b>of</b> their <b>biocenoses</b> is not documented in the literature. The present work aims to compare the biocenoses from SBR and SBBR. In order to reach this objective four reactors were operated in parallel. One reactor was operated just with suspended biomass (SBR 1) while the others combined suspended biomass with biofilm cultivation. The biofilm was formed on a new type of polyethylene support developed by University of Minho, called DupUM.

All the D. desulfuricans strains grown on lactate and sulfate indicated the presence of considerable amounts of i-C 15 : 0, i-C 17 : 1 and C 16 : 0. Although differences in the quantities of individual fatty acids present in each strain were clear {{in the group of}} soil strains (similarity, 67. 6 %), in contrast to almost identical fatty acid patterns (similarity, near 100 %) in the intestinal strains, the results were variable within the limits acceptable for species demonstration. The higher similarity of the fatty acid profiles of intestinal strains may be a result of the similarity <b>of</b> <b>biocenoses</b> in the human digestive tract. The coefficients of variability of i-C 17 : 1 and i-C 15 : 0 (the major branched-chain fatty acids), as well as clustering of the investigated strains compared with strains described in the literature after plotting percentages of i-C 17 : 1 fatty acid against i-C 15 : 0 fatty acid, confirmed a certain heterogeneity of cellular fatty acid profiles within the group of soil strains, in contrast to almost ideal homogeneity within the group of intestinal isolates. Intestinal strains contained a higher ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (2. 2 +/- 0. 14) than did soil strains (1. 6 +/- 0. 2; in one case, 2. 7).
