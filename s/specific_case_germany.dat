40|$|The {{sales taxes}} in the EU - and in several other {{countries}} - are practiced as value-added tax of the consumption type with invoice method. Literature on microsimulation models (MSM) {{for this type of}} VAT is rare, though the importance of VAT has continuously increased. We discuss the issues of VAT-MSM in detail and develop a basic general VAT-MSM, applicable to the EU member states (and beyond). To illustrate the functioning of the general model, we apply it in detail to the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Germany.</b> We provide comprehensive estimation results for the distributional and fiscal effects of the German VAT. Finally, we simulate the effects of a small VAT reform in 2010, comparing static and behavioral response simulations...|$|R

The semester project is working around different theories about interviews, innovations in sociotechnical systems and the implementation of technologies. With these theories, a technical view of the algaetechnology and empiric data makes a base for {{an analysis of the}} collected data. This makes it possible to make a draft for a deployment strategy, which will be included in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|In {{parts of}} the German media, {{with the support of}} a number of German economists, the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s low nominal {{interest}} rate policy is criticised as unnecessary, ineffective and as expropriating the German saver. This paper provides a review of the relevant arguments. It is recalled that returns on savings are anchored to the real rate of return on capital. Good monetary policy tries to avoid being a source of disturbance in itself, and may be able to smooth the effects of temporary external shocks, but beyond that cannot structurally improve the real rate of return on capital. Against this general background, the paper critically analyses a number of recent arguments as to why low interest rate policies could actually be counterproductive. Finally, the paper reviews what can be done about the medium to long-term real rate of return on capital, which remains in any case the basic issue for the saver, focusing on the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Germany.</b> The key policies identified relate to demographics, education, labour markets, infrastructure and technology. Low growth dynamics in the coming decades and correspondingly low real rates of return on investments are not inevitable...|$|R

By collecting taxes and granting mon-etary transfers, the government tries to affect the personal distribution of incomes. Whereas the supply of redistribution {{is relatively easy to}} determine, it is rather difficult to identify the determinants of the citizens’ demand for redistribution. Most of the lit-erature concerning the individuals’ preferences for redistribution relies on survey based analysis. A shortcoming of these studies is the failure of imposing a budget con-straint. Discrete-Choice-Experiments (DCE) solve this problem by forcing individuals to take the consequences of their decisions with respect to their own income into ac-count. This study aims at developing a theory based approach to elicit individuals’ preferences for redistribution using DCEs. For the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of <b>Germany,</b> we show how to design and implement such a DCE. In particular, we discuss how the price at-tribute in a DCE should be specified and which levels adequately define the price an individual is willing to pay for redistribution. We are able to demonstrate that even for a highly complex topic such as redistribution a correctly applied DCE can provide au-thoritative results. This allows deriving policy implications on how to design redistribu-tive policies which are in line with citizens’ preferences. ...|$|R
40|$|Power {{production}} from renewable energies is supported through special support schemes {{in almost all}} industrialised countries. This {{is because they are}} generally not competitive today although their use offers a number of benefits that are not considered by energy markets. These support schemes need to be financed, though. Two main options can be observed: Either support through the general public budget or through a renewable energy mark-up that is charged to final power consumers. As this mark-up increases power costs for consumers, the support schemes have been criticised, especially by power intensive industries. It argues that it looses competitiveness on the world marked with higher electricity costs due to the mark-up. However, this argument is short-sighted as it only reflects one side of the medal, namely the mark-up. The increased used of renewable energies may also have an influence on the power price on the whole sale market. Based on the analysis of a <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> in <b>Germany</b> the present paper analyses this impact on the whole market more generally. Assuming a simple power market, I show that the power costs for consumers may decrease due to the support scheme. If and to what extend power costs decrease depends on the specific characteristics of the market and the value attached to the greenness of power from renewable energies. [...] Renewable energy suppport schemes...|$|R
40|$|Language {{minorities}} can {{be found}} as evidence of unfinished nation-building in relatively closed territorial settlements all over contemporary Europe. From a comparative perspective, different paths of accommodating linguistic diversity can be followed resulting in very dissimilar regimes of legal, political and cultural recognition. In recent years, standardisation of minority protection has taken place, with a new emphasis on the values of linguistic diversity, non-discrimination and tolerance. As will be argued, the expanding rights of language minorities must be understood {{in relation to a}} re-structuration of nation-states in Europe and a re-evaluation of difference in the course of European integration. The confrontation with internal diversity and the confrontation with a Europe of deep diversity are closely interlinked setting the conditions for the unfolding of a new politics of recognition towards language minorities. This changing minority-majority relationship and the related processes of Europeanization of opportunity structures for the political and cultural mobilisation of language minorities shall be analysed with reference to <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> studies from <b>Germany,</b> France and Spain. identity; minorities; Nation-state; civil society; Germany; France; Spain...|$|R
