The overburden overlying the <b>salt</b> <b>cavity</b> is characterized by a competent layer where most brittle damage, with the associated microseismicity, is expected.

A methodology of a large scale coupled continuum-discrete modelling is proposed and applied to the site of Cerville-Buissoncourt. The numerical verification of the hybrid approach response is achieved by comparing the results with those from the fully continuum model at the site scale when the competent layers behave elastically. The first results of a large scale modelling based on the hybrid approach suggest that the fracture mechanisms in the competent layers are predominantly tensile.

Understanding such behaviors and developing relevant constitutive models require a micro-mechanical analysis.

We develop a model that treats monocrystals as spherical inclusions embedded in an infinite homogeneous matrix with purely elastic inclusion-matrix interactions. To predict grain breakage and its subsequent impact, we also introduce a failure criterion. The model provides micro-mechanical interpretations of the common viscoplastic and fatigue behavior of salt such as damage and accelerated creep from grain breakage and the shakedown effect observed in elastoplastic media. Finite element (FE) simulations confirmed the macrostrain and microstress predictions obtained by homogenization.

The potential of passive microseismic monitoring to prevent such disasters was already indicated by several studies. Nonetheless, to further improve monitoring reliability {{a better understanding of}} associated seismicity is inevitable. In this context, within a large multi-parameter research project at Cerville-Buissoncourt in Lorraine, France, the growth of a single, shallow, about 150 m diameter <b>salt</b> <b>cavity</b> created by salt dissolution mining was surveyed from 2004 until 2009 when the cavity reached its critical size and a ”controlled ” collapse was initiated.

40|$|Conceptual {{design studies}} have been {{conducted}} to identify Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) systems which are technically feasible and potentially attractive for future electric utility load-levelling applications. The CAES concept consists of compressing air during off-peak periods and storing it in underground facilities for later use. During peak-load periods the air would be withdrawn, heated by recuperation and combustion and expanded through turbines to generate power. By using off-peak electricity for compression and stored air for peak-load generation, the resulting oil consumption would be about 40 per cent of that consumed by conventional gas-turbine peaking plants. The turbomachinery requirements for this type of system could be met using existing equipment with relatively modest modifications. Although the study discussed herein focused on the storage of air in hydraulically compensated, mined, hard-rock caverns, the compressed air could also be stored in underground aquifers or leached-out <b>salt</b> <b>cavities.</b> Conventional underground excavation technology could be used to construct these storage caverns. A geological survey of the north-central and north-east regions of the United States indicated that sufficient siting opportunities exist such that a prudently designed CAES plant should have little long-term adverse impact on the environment. The competitive position of CAES relative to conventional generation alternatives is highly dependent on utility-specific factors. The cost of electric energy from CAES is generally competitive with costs from conventional peak-shaving systems such as gas turbines and will improve as low-cost off-peak energy from nuclear plants becomes available. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{objective}} {{to better understand}} the induced microseismicity in a salt mine environment due to an underground solution mining, an in situ experiment is undertaken by GISOS 1 in the Lorraine salt basin. The overburden overlying the <b>salt</b> <b>cavity</b> is characterized by the presence of two competent layers where most microseismic events are expected. This paper presents a coupled continuum-discrete modelling to simulate the mechanics of fracture initiation and propagation in the rock mass overlying the cavity: discrete approach for the competent layers and continuum approach for marls, salt and other rocks and soils. For the competent layers, numerous calibrations of the model microparameters based on the laboratory results are firstly performed. The first coupled modelling results suggest that the mechanism of fracturing in the competent layers is predominantly tensile as it could be expected. The results also show that the microseismic events associated to the progressive damage in the competent layers through microcraks development can be modelled. This opens interesting perspectives to assess the feasibility of seismic monitoring of underground cavities by comparing, in the future, the numerical modelling results with the recorded seismicity of the study area...|$|E

In this respect GISOS, a French scientific interest group is investigating techniques for monitoring the eventual collapse of underground cavities. One of methods under investigation was monitoring the stability of a <b>salt</b> <b>cavity</b> through recording microseismic-precursor signals that may indicate the onset of rock failure. The data were recorded in a salt mine in Lorraine (France) when monitoring the controlled collapse of 2, 000, 000 m 3 of rocks surrounding a cavity at 130 m depth. The monitoring in the 30 Hz to 3 kHz frequency range highlights the occurrence of events with high energy during periods of macroscopic movement, once the layers had ruptured; {{they appear to be}} the consequence of the post-rupture rock movements related to the intense deformation of the cavity roof. Moreover the analysis shows the presence of some interesting precursory signals before the cavity collapsed. They occur a few hours before the failure phases, when the rocks were being weakened and damaged. They come from the damaging and breaking process, when micro-cracks appear and then coalesce. From these results we expect that deeper signal analysis and statistical analysis on the complete event time distribution (several millions of files) will allow us to finalize a complete typology of each signal families and their relations with the evolution steps of the cavity over the five years monitoring...|$|E

For this subsurface model scenario we generated different synthetic data sets without and with adding random noise in order to robust the applied techniques for the real field applications. Datasets are inverted by posing different constraints on the initial model. Results reveal principally the capability of the applied integrative geophysical approach to resolve the CAES targets (plume, host reservoir, and cap rock). Constrained inversion models of elastic FWI and ERT are even able to recover well the gradual gas desaturation with depth.

Laboratory research results have been confirmed by in-situ creep experiments using a large rock salt pillar.

40|$|The {{design of}} a salt working {{requires}} detailed studies of the chambers and galleries which will remain opened during the operation. The excavation of the cavity changes the natural distribution of tensions, and the resulting derived cause the flow of <b>salt</b> towards the <b>cavity.</b> The relation between the diverting tensions and the velocity of the associated deformation is defined by a constitutive law depending on temperature. There {{are a series of}} computer programs which solve the equations of the thermic and mechanical phenomena, which are used to produce results to compare and combine with the measurements gathered in the mine. So it is a study of the rheologic behavior of a salt material in a visco-elasto-plastic performance, representing such performances by means of programs of numerical simulation based on procedures of finite differences with integration in time...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{is a very}} {{promising}} source of fuel; it has already constituted {{a significant part of}} modern innovations for power generation in automobile and space shuttle. Hydrogen can be produced from several sources and as a byproduct of some chemical processes, including the association of magnesium with water. The production yield of this later production method is limited by influences associated with the formation of passive oxide/hydroxide films on the surface of magnesium metal during reaction. The experiments within this project highlight optimization conditions towards improved hydrogen yield via magnesium hydrolysis. Reduced rate of hydroxide layer formation on Mg surface, hence increased production yield, is accomplished by exposing a greater surface area of Mg in contact with water. This has been achieved via ball milling process; Mg powders with greater higher surface area to volume ratios are ball-milled with certain salts (e. g. NaCl and KCl). The weight percentage (wt. %) of these salt within the mixture influences hydrogen production yield by facilitating the creation of reaction sites. Here, these <b>salts</b> produce <b>cavities</b> within the magnesium/salt powdery matrices, thus creating more assessable surface area for water. The experimental results from this work reveal that ball milling duration and weight percentage of salts affect the final size of Mg particle produced. Thus, the maximum hydrogen yield is achieved by controlling these two parameters and the results are further correlated by the microstructure of the samples under scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Acridine orange (AO) is a metachromic {{cationic}} dye and its photophysical property is extremely sensitive to its environment and surrounding pH conditions. One {{of the most}} important applications of AO is its photosensitizing ability and thus extensively employed in photodynamic therapy. AO exhibits excellent potential towards selective anti-cancer cell activity often considered as a "Magic Bullet" for cancer treatment. The photosensitizer when administered intravenously reaches to the target tissue by circulating through blood, which emphasizes its interaction with various biomolecules such as proteins, DNAs, biosurfactants etc. Moreover, the interactions between dyes and surfactants, in general, are interesting for their complex nature governed and influenced by the chemical structure of dye and physicochemical properties of the surfactants. Bile salts are referred to as biosurfactants taking into account their capacity to solubilize and emulsify cholesterol, bilirubin, lecithin, lipids and fat soluble vitamins in living organisms. The focus of the present study is to study the interaction AO with two variants of bile salts deoxycholates (sodium deoxycholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate) and cholates (sodium cholate, sodium taurocholate) by spectroscopic technique. These bile salts below CMC induce aggregation of the dye whereas AO gets solubilised in monomeric form in the bile <b>salt</b> micellar <b>cavity</b> above their CMC. Dihyroxy bile salts induce the aggregation of AO more efficiently as compared to the corresponding trihydroxy bile salts. The binding constant and partition coefficient were determined and the order was found to be NaDC > NaTDC > NaTC > NaC. The negative values of standard free energy and enthalpy indicates towards the spontaneity and exothermic nature of these processes. The effect of ionic strength and cosolvents was also studied on the micellisation and aggregation behaviour of AO...|$|R
40|$|In a {{world where}} energy demand, population, and {{environmental}} concern are increasing by the day, the use of solar energy and other renewable energy sources becomes ever more important. Most of the African population lives in rural areas and uses wood as primary energy source for cooking. The wood, however, can {{be replaced by the}} energy in the abundant sunshine most African countries experiences and used in solar cookers. However, the biggest disadvantage of most common solar cookers available today is that they are dependent on direct solar radiation to work. This makes them vulnerable to the intermittent nature of the sun and limits the cooking to the sunny hours of the day. In this thesis, a possible solution to that problem area is examined. A solar energy heat storage for vapour based solar concentrators is designed, constructed and analysed with cooking of the traditional Ethiopian bread injera in mind. The storage consists of an aluminium bolt with <b>salt</b> filled <b>cavities</b> that has working fluid (steam or oil) running through it. The energy stored during the salt melting (latent heat) is released at constant temperature between 210 °C- 220 °C which is the melting temperature of the salt, and the temperature needed to cook injeras. One experiment was performed with heat transfer oil as working fluid, but did not yield any results due to air bubbles that prevented circulation. Two experiments were done with steam as working fluid. The first experiment measured the discharge of the storage which was found to be a temperature fall from 221. 8 °C to 50 °C during a time span of 85 hours. The other experiment aimed for boiling of one litre of water, but the highest temperature reached was 70. 9 °C. However, several modifications can be done to improve the storage capacity and cooking procedure, as for instance increasing the amount of salt. </p...|$|R
