40|$|The {{experience}} of villagers in Maimafu, in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, {{calls attention to}} two forms of social interaction between rural people and outsiders that have been little examined in the anthropological literature. One of these is scientific research {{and the other is}} scientific tourism, a form of ecotourism that is linked not to science but to self‐fashioning and individual gain. Scientific tourists may be seeking an educational adventure that they can turn into symbolic capital on their return home, a way into the world of science, or an experience that can be turned into economic capital through publication in popular magazines. For both researchers and <b>scientific</b> <b>journalists,</b> New Guinea combines the exotic, the about‐to‐be‐lost, the primitive, the untouched, and the spectacular and is therefore a powerful space for imaginary and representational practice...|$|R

30|$|The title {{assumes that}} there is a {{difference}} between political Utopia and the transhumanist techno-vision. But if one follows recent publications that promise a renaissance of utopia, the transhumanist “Zukunftsfiguren des 21. Jahrhunderts (21 st century figures of the future)” [1] are not a disconnected trend running parallel to the classic utopian discourse since Plato [2] and More [3]; in fact, they are its consumers. They have, so to speak, incorporated the original utopian potential and thus undergone a transformation beyond recognition. The new bearers of modern utopia are no longer philosophers like Plato, humanists like More or even novelists like Aldous Huxley [4] and Ursula K. Le Guin [5]. Rather, they are transhumanist engineers and technical scientists like Eric Drexler [6], Hans Moravec [7], Ray Kurzweil [8], Marvin Minsky [9], etc. Their versions have been broken down with the concrete research policies by <b>scientific</b> <b>journalists</b> and managers like William S. Bainbridge and Mihail Roco [10].|$|R

30|$|Second, {{society may}} be seen as citizen science, {{reflections}} of which are crowdsourcing, Wikipedia, and other novelties from recent times. In another words, society in this case is a source of ideas. Citizen science, in turn, usually may prosper only in civil society. Civil society in Russia is underdeveloped. Indeed, the very term now has a rather negative connotation since it was brought to the country by foreign (mostly American) foundations. Building civil society was in their agenda, and some elements of civil society do exist in Russia. For example, the Society of Scientific Researchers which is a union of scientists, researchers, and even <b>scientific</b> <b>journalists</b> who are interested in problems around the scientific complex and are ready to raise their voice in support (or against) new policy measures. But overall, the attempt of foreigners to expand civil society failed. Nevertheless, an indigenous civil society tradition expressed in samizdat and underground artistic movements during the Soviet era and in the attempt to build an independent media during the post-Soviet era, persists.|$|R
