5|$|Cervical <b>stenosis</b> {{refers to}} an {{abnormally}} narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical <b>stenosis</b> and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing of the {{pulmonary}} artery as it exits the heart. Other cardiac abnormalities may be present, including aortic <b>stenosis,</b> or mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{therapy has}} also been {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of peripheral vasculature <b>stenosis</b> and considered for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.|$|E
5|$|A self-expanding metal stent is {{permanently}} deployed {{within the}} dominant transverse sinus across the <b>stenosis</b> under general anaesthesia. In general patients are discharged the next day. Patients require double antiplatelet therapy {{for a period}} of up to 3 months after the procedure and aspirin therapy for up to 1 year.|$|E
5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (<b>stenosis)</b> or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic <b>stenosis,</b> angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Campbell became {{addicted}} to painkillers prescribed for his spinal <b>stenosis,</b> taking {{as many as}} ten OxyContin pills a day with Budweiser. He went through rehabilitation and broke his addiction the same year, and since publicizing the incident in 2013 has spoken out {{about the dangers of}} substance abuse.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic <b>stenosis</b> is {{an often}} {{congenital}} narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a balloon catheter).|$|E
5|$|Surgery may {{be useful}} in those with a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. It may also be useful in those with spinal <b>stenosis.</b> In the absence of these issues, there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E
5|$|The mucosal {{lining of}} the trachea may also be injured by {{inhalation}} of hot gases or harmful fumes such as chlorine gas. This can lead to edema (swelling), necrosis (death of the tissue), scar formation, and ultimately <b>stenosis.</b> However, TBI due to inhalation, foreign body aspiration, and medical procedures is uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Ford died on December 26, 2006, at {{his home}} in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic {{cerebrovascular}} disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis. He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic <b>stenosis</b> and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve <b>stenosis,</b> {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} <b>stenosis</b> of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the <b>stenosis</b> may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary <b>stenosis</b> are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, growth retardation, pulmonary <b>stenosis</b> (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness of breath), and renal agenesis (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal <b>stenosis</b> involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{evidence}} both {{for and against}} the association of pyloric <b>stenosis</b> and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) {{has been linked to}} an increased probability of pyloric <b>stenosis</b> in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric <b>stenosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|From {{clinical}} trials, 20% is {{the average}} <b>stenosis</b> at plaques that subsequently rupture with resulting complete artery closure. Most severe clinical events do not occur at plaques that produce high-grade <b>stenosis.</b> From clinical trials, only 14% of heart attacks occur from artery closure at plaques producing a 75% or greater <b>stenosis</b> prior to the vessel closing.|$|E
25|$|If {{studies show}} carotid artery <b>stenosis,</b> {{and the person}} has a degree of {{residual}} function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the <b>stenosis)</b> may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.|$|E
25|$|Lumen <b>stenosis</b> that {{is greater}} than 75% was {{considered}} the hallmark of clinically significant disease in the past because recurring episodes of angina and abnormalities in stress tests are only detectable at that particular severity of <b>stenosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ascending aortic {{aneurysm}} causing pulmonary <b>stenosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carotid <b>stenosis</b> {{may occur}} in {{patients}} with atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{urethral}} valves; urethral or meatal <b>stenosis.</b> These causes {{are treated}} surgically when possible.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{auscultation}} of {{an individual}} with mitral <b>stenosis,</b> the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral <b>stenosis.</b> It {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of the {{gastrointestinal system}} include numerous forms of <b>stenosis</b> and atresia, and perforation, such as gastroschisis.|$|E
25|$|Infantile pyloric <b>stenosis</b> is {{typically}} managed with surgery; very few cases are mild {{enough to be}} treated medically.|$|E
25|$|AF in {{the context}} of mitral <b>stenosis</b> is {{associated}} with a seventeenfold increase in stroke risk.|$|E
25|$|He {{suffered}} from aortic <b>stenosis,</b> {{and died of}} a coronary occlusion in his home in Hawthorn, aged 59.|$|E
25|$|Late graft <b>stenosis,</b> {{particularly}} of saphenous vein grafts due to atherosclerosis causing recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} options for mitral <b>stenosis</b> include medical management, mitral valve replacement by surgery, and percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty by balloon catheter.|$|E
25|$|Although UGI {{endoscopy}} {{would demonstrate}} pyloric obstruction, physicians {{would find it}} difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic pyloric <b>stenosis</b> and pylorospasm.|$|E
25|$|If {{pulmonary}} hypertension secondary to mitral <b>stenosis</b> is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) {{component of the}} second heart sound (S2) will become loud.|$|E
25|$|Mitral <b>stenosis</b> is a valvular {{heart disease}} {{characterized}} by the narrowing of the orifice of the mitral valve of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Mitral {{valvuloplasty}} is a {{minimally invasive}} therapeutic procedure to correct an uncomplicated mitral <b>stenosis</b> by dilating the valve using a balloon.|$|E
25|$|Vascular disease {{includes}} large vessel disease such as bilateral renal artery <b>stenosis</b> {{and small}} vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{associated}} with ureteral <b>stenosis</b> and interstitial nephritis. In bone marrow transplant recipients it is notable as a cause for hemorrhagic cystitis.|$|E
