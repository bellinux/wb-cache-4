40|$|Abstract: The {{effectiveness}} of microwave heating has been evaluated for the detoxification of aflatoxins contaminated peanut and peanut products. The products comprise of various confectionery such as peanut brittle toffee, peanut brittle <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> and jaggery, roasted and salted peanut {{and peanut butter}} which were highly contaminated with aflatoxins B 1 ranging from 5 to 183 µg/kg and aflatoxin B 2 ranging from 7 to 46. 7 µg/kg. The level of aflatoxins was determined and subsequently products were treated to microwave heating, {{which resulted in the}} reduction of aflatoxins content. The microwave cooking resulted in 50 to 60 % reduction in the levels of aflatoxins B 1, while B 2 was reduced to non-detectable limits...|$|R

500|$|Odwalla's {{sugar content}} {{can be even}} higher than Coca-Cola's.

[...] Coca-Cola contains 3.25 grams <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> per ounce.

40|$|Abstract: The {{precipitation}} in continuously casting <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> a Ti-Nb {{microalloyed steel}} was studied. The samples {{were taken from}} different places along cross section <b>of</b> <b>slabs</b> and the precipitations were observed by TEM. The {{results show that the}} centre area <b>of</b> <b>slab</b> contains more precipitates of Ti-Nb and carbonitrides more uniformly distribute in the centre along thickness direction. Moreover, the precipitates in the middle are more than those in the edge along width direction <b>of</b> <b>slab.</b> Some large carbonitrides exist in the middle <b>of</b> <b>slab</b> because the temperature in the middle is higher during slab cooling resulting in the large precipitates. The study provides the basis for understanding the precipitation in <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> Ti-Nb microalloyed steels...|$|R
