5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation.

He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E

5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English <b>scientists,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited <b>scientists</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
