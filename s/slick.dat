5|$|The next {{match was}} a tag team match between The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager The Baron, and The Bolsheviks (Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff), who {{were accompanied by}} <b>Slick.</b> Immediately, The Powers of Pain chased The Bolsheviks from the ring. <b>Slick,</b> however, distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give The Bolsheviks an advantage. Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical low {{combined}} with a frontal system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; <b>slick</b> roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.|$|E
50|$|The local horse thieves {{were known}} as the Pony Club, and the vigilantes were the <b>Slicks.</b> At first, the <b>Slicks</b> would just hold Pony Club members caught {{stealing}} horses until a jury trial could be held. But Pony Club members usually had no trouble finding witnesses to prove their innocence, so the <b>Slicks</b> eventually started holding their own trials and the guilty were whipped. Things {{came to a head}} during the election of 1832 when large numbers of Pony Club members and <b>Slicks</b> got into a brawl. The <b>Slicks</b> won the fight, and the Pony Club demanded a grand jury try the <b>Slicks</b> on charges of assault and battery with intent to kill. However, the jury ended up commending the <b>Slicks</b> and thanking them for their work.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{compared}} the normalized radar cross section {{in the cases of}} oil spill, biogenic <b>slicks,</b> and clean sea areas with image samples made from 11 -pixel NRCS average, and determined their thresholds of the NRCS of the synthetic aperture radar. The results show that the thresholds of oil and biogenic <b>slicks</b> exhibit good consistency with the corresponding synthetic aperture radar images. In addition, we used the normalized radar cross section of clean water from adjacent patches of oil or biogenic <b>slicks</b> areas to replace that of oil or biogenic <b>slicks</b> areas, and retrieve wind field by CMOD 5. n and compare wind velocity mending of oil and biogenic <b>slicks</b> areas with Weather Research and Forecasting modeled data, from which the root mean squares of wind speed (wind direction) inversion are 0. 89 m/s (20. 26 A degrees) and 0. 88 m/s (7. 07 A degrees), respectively. Therefore, after the occurrence of oil spill or biogenic <b>slicks,</b> the real wind field could be repaired using the method we introduced in this paper. We believe that this method could improve the accuracy in assessment of a real wind field on medium and small scales at sea, and enhance effectively the monitoring works on similar oil or biogenic <b>slicks</b> incidents at sea surface.

5|$|June 2, 2007– Tropical Storm Barry makes {{landfall}} near Tampa Bay as a disorganized tropical cyclone, {{and drops}} moderate precipitation across the drought-ridden state that peaks at 6.99inches (178mm) in Palm Beach. The rainfall causes <b>slick</b> roads, leading to two indirect traffic casualties. Damage {{in the state}} is minor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the group}} disbanded, Schulz and Esch formed the band <b>Slick</b> Idiot, while Konietzko and Skold regrouped as MDFMK, adding singer Lucia Cifarelli {{to form a}} trio. MDFMK {{released}} one self-titled album with Republic/Universal Records, and toured North America. After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who would produce the next album, Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records and asked if they'd be interested in signing KMFDM. The label agreed, although at the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate.|$|E
5|$|Along {{the coast}} of North Carolina, the {{hurricane}} produced light winds and rough waves, as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern New England, causing flooding in portions of New York City and producing <b>slick</b> roads that caused nine traffic fatalities. Able produced hurricane-force winds in Nova Scotia, and damage across Canada totaled over $1million (1950CAD, $ USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries. Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned.|$|E
40|$|Images of {{distinctive}} <b>slicks</b> in the Gulf of Mexico {{collected by}} two orbital platforms are presented. An analytical expression is derived {{for the formation}} of floating <b>slicks</b> based on a parameterization of seafloor flow rate, downstream movement on the surface, half-life of floating oil, and threshold thickness for detection. From application of this equation to the lengths of the observed <b>slicks,</b> it is suggested that the <b>slicks</b> in the Atlantis photograph and in the TM image represent seepage rates of 2. 2 - 30 cu m/ 1000 sq km s and 1. 4 - 18 cu m/ 1000 sq km d, respectively. Generalizing to an annual rate suggests that total natural seepage in this region is of the order of at least 20, 000 cu m/yr (120, 000 barrels/yr) ...|$|R

5|$|Browne's {{interest}} in Amazing declined when {{the project to}} turn it into a <b>slick</b> magazine was derailed. Although he stayed involved with Fantastic Adventures, another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on Amazing to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on lap 46, as Barrichello and Rosberg were contesting eighth position. Button {{had caught}} Maldonado and Alguersuari, and passed both cars for tenth place. Mark Webber {{was the first}} driver to switch to <b>slick</b> tyres, and was {{followed}} by Barrichello and Buemi. Kobayashi and Massa, fighting for second place, were both passed by Schumacher on lap 51; Massa then passed Kobayashi for third place. As the drivers pitted for <b>slick</b> tyres {{over the next three}} laps, Massa damaged his wing forcing him into another pitstop, while damage to Adrian Sutil's car led to his retirement. Button had risen from ninth after his pit-stop to fourth, and was catching the leading trio of Vettel, Schumacher and Webber. On lap 56 Heidfeld, while battling Kobayashi for fifth place, collided with the rear of the Sauber which damaged his front wing. The wing then detached and folded under the car, and Heidfeld after losing control of his car ran down an escape road on turn 3. The debris on-track from the accident called the sixth safety car period of the race.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1970s, highly <b>slick</b> and {{commercial}} bands such as Philly soul group The O'Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success. By {{the end of}} the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, had been disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E
5000|$|At the start, {{the rear}} tires ("slicks") {{were made with}} a {{bias-ply}} construction ("wrinklewall" [...] <b>slicks</b> had not been invented yet), which meant that grip upon launching was poor. Racers who performed these altered wheelbase modifications found it shifted {{the center of gravity}} rearward, which placed more weight on the rear wheels, enhancing traction from these bias-ply <b>slicks.</b> Because of these many obvious modifications they did not look stock, hence the name [...] "funny". The wheelbases were changed to assist traction for the narrow (7 in-wide) <b>slicks</b> (required by NHRA rules), while keeping the mandatory factory distance between axle centers.|$|R

5|$|The book {{became a}} bestseller and was well {{received}} by {{graduates of the}} est training. Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, {{and a number of}} critics felt that it was unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining, others felt the tone was too <b>slick,</b> promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was a <b>slick</b> and pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} hybrid-polarity (HP) {{architecture}} is exploited to observe sea oil <b>slicks.</b> HP features are interpreted {{in terms of}} sea surface scattering with or without oil <b>slicks,</b> under low to moderate wind conditions. They are shown to exhibit a different sensitivity with respect to slick-free, weak-damping slick-covered and oil-covered sea surface. This sensitivity is verified against HP measurements obtained transforming actual L- and C-band quad-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data where both oil <b>slicks</b> and weak-damping look-alikes are present. Experiments demonstrate: a) the remarkable performance of HP features to both observe oil <b>slicks</b> and distinguishing them from weak-damping look-alikes; b) the marginal effect played by the sensor’s noise floor on HP features performance; c) the pronounced sensitivity of the HP features to the damping properties of the surfactants; d) the comparable performance that characterizes polarimetric entropy derived by HP and conventional polarimetric measurements...|$|R
