500|$|The album's {{title track}} and lead single [...] "Eazy-Duz-It", written by MC Ren, {{opens with a}} woman acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then {{interrupts}} saying [...] "Bitch <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>up,</b> get the fuck outta here." [...] This {{is followed by a}} bass line provided by Dr. Dre. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does. The song declares that Eazy is a [...] "hardcore villain" [...] who collects money from his prostitutes, and feels great when his [...] "pockets are fat." [...] The chorus, repeated three times, states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>up,</b> and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

50|$|The {{group also}} created a series of videos in this period. Pilot (1977) was {{commissioned}} by TVOntario, Test Tube (1979) was created during a residency at the De Appel Gallery and produced for Dutch television. <b>Shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Up</b> (1984) was likewise commissioned by De Appel, this time in collaboration with Time Based Arts, also for Dutch television. Pilot, an appropriation of the documentary format, is a further elaboration of the General Idea identity. Test Tube (a faux-soap opera, complete with commercials) and <b>Shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Up</b> are deconstructions of and confrontations with the media distortion of the persona of the artist.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes Springsteen {{felt the}} need to {{reiterate}} parts of the message after subsequent songs, especially if Brooocing continued.

50|$|Being in a {{cover band}} {{saturated}} market, {{members of these}} bands started networking across the region and started booking shows for their own bands as well as bringing acts from other cities and far away places. It soon took off and there were shows every other week and bands popping up every day. Strong connections to nearby already established scenes in Chicago, South Bend, Indianapolis and Detroit were made and growth continued producing even more bands such as After The Quarrel, <b>Shut</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Up,</b> and most notably Blood In/ Blood Out. Apathy, commercialism and violence has marred the scene {{over the last decade}} and as with any punk genre and subcultures in general the fakes come and go, personal lives take precedence over participation, and Things change but, the majority of the stalwarts remain and the ball keeps rolling with shows in Hammond and Gary and new bands such as No Dice and All These Years and Nothing, plus strong ties to the Heavy Metal and Hip-hop communities, as well as international ties to the Punk and Hardcore scene from the years of hard work, perseverance and resistance to the powers that be.|$|E
