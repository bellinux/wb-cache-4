50|$|By 1985, the MBTA {{was finally}} in a {{position}} to retire its PCCs from the Green Line as the issues plaguing the Boeings were resolved to a point where a majority of the cars operated reliably and the MBTA placed an order for additional light rail cars from Kinki Sharyo, which were delivered the following year. With the PCC cars retired, the Green Line operating fleet had become exclusively pantograph equipped, eliminating the need for the wire frogs that were used to guide the trolley poles' current collectors at switches. The overhead catenary received additional upgrades, the first of which used primarily <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> support from the existing line poles. The second upgrade used many more bracket arms. Due to the added weight of the new overhead construction, side guy wires were added to many existing line poles or a horizontal beam was installed across a pair of line poles.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} form, the Type B was an equal <b>span,</b> <b>wire</b> braced two bay biplane, though the inner bay {{was only about}} half the width of the outer. The two spar fabric covered wings had the same rectangular plan apart from angled tips. There was no stagger, so the three sets of parallel interplane struts were parallel and vertical; the innermost pair defined the centre section and supported the nacelle with the assistance of further cabane struts. The rear spar was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping. A second Type B, the B2 which appeared in August 1911 with similar wings, was six months later modified into a sesquiplane with an upper wing span of 11.6 m, a lower span of 7.30 m and a total wing area of 32 m2. The upper overhang was supported by parallel, outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts. Many later Caudron designs were similarly braced sesquiplanes.|$|E

She twice got underway in June for engineering training and on 8 July conducted three days of sea trials off Jacksonville. On 11 September, the ship held a dependent's cruise a day ahead of commencing an extended maintenance availability. On 18 December, the SPS-40 radar suffered damage when it rotated into <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> rigged for holiday lighting. Although a 23 December fast cruise concluded her availability, the need for a significant amount of work on her underwater hull led to the guided-missile destroyer being towed to Jacksonville Shipyard on 13 January 1987 for three months in drydock. On 9 April, Tattnall left drydock and entered Mayport under tow the following day. The ship occupied herself with inspections, sea trials, and a visit to Jacksonville as part of the [...] "Say No to Drugs" [...] program ahead of her 5 June departure for refresher training at Guatanamo Bay.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shortage}} of multiproduct replenishment {{ships in the}} early 1970s {{led to the development}} of an improvised system for dispensing fuel from ammunition and stores ships that allowed them to transfer fuel to smaller combatants. Neither type of ship had cargo fuel, but each could share its own fuel with destroyers and frigates in an emergency. The lack of sufficient numbers of AOEs or AORs precluded the deployment of these types in support of any of the surface warfare groups, which were generally composed of destroyers and frigates. The old saw that necessity is the mother of invention proved to be true when Rear Admiral John Johnson devised a practical solution to the {{shortage of}} fuel-carrying UNREP ships based on the modification of existing cargo transfer gear on ammunition and stores ships. As commander Task Force 73 (the service force of the Seventh Fleet) in 1973, Admiral Johnson had to contend with the problem of how to provide logistic support for the two Seventh Fleet destroyers deployed to the Indian Ocean for an extended period of time. The answer was to turn the [...] into a mini multiproduct ship by adding two cargo reefer boxes as deck cargo and outfitting it with a jury-rigged fuel station. The latter was achieved by temporarily rigging a 7-inch fuel hose to the starboard side cargo station—the one closest to the ship's fuel receiving raiser. The highline was used as a <b>span</b> <b>wire,</b> and fuel hose saddles were supported from a wire whip from a nearby hauling winch or a fiber whip from a nearby gypsy. Fuel was pumped from the ship's own fuel bunkers to the receiving ship alongside using the fuel-transfer pump normally carried aboard the AE. The pumping rate was considerably less than that of a fleet oiler and, while workable, contained many drawbacks.|$|E

The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned <b>span</b> <b>wires</b> and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helicopter pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations.

40|$|Three basic bridge {{protection}} schemes were investigated: Rigid passive overhead device, ● Nonrigid passive overhead device, and ● Active {{detection and}} warning system. The first scheme investigated {{was the use}} of an immovable, rigid crossbeam across the road. Thecrossbeam would beset at the clearance of the bridge, and an overweight vehicle would strike the beam, thus warning the driver that the truck wastoohigh for the bridge. Such devices have been used in the past in other states, but, because of their extreme liability, this method was not seriously considered. Inaddition to possible damage to the overheight truck, vehicles traveling behind a log truck are in danger from logs that could be knocked off the truck by the crossbeam. The second scheme investigated {{was the use of}} passive overhead devices that are not rigid and destructive. In some states, items such as chains have been suspended from a <b>span</b> <b>wire</b> in advance of low-clearance obstructions. The noise of the chain striking the top of the overweight vehicle is intended to warn the driver without causing significant damage to the vehicle. However, it was felt that passive overhead devices could not adequately warn the driver of a loud log truck with an overheight load. The third scheme investigated was a system utilizing infrared beam devices located in advance of the bridge, which would detect the overweight vehicle and warn the driver through means of audible bells and/or warning signs with flashing beacons. This scheme was selected for implementation. Warning System Components A system to detect and warn overheight vehicles was designed that incorporated the following five basic parts: ● Advance warning signs of the height restriction, A device to detect overheight vehicles, ● Audible alarm bells that are activated when an overheight vehicle is detected, ● Overhead warning signs with flashing yellow beacons that are activated when an overheight vehicle is detected, an...|$|E
