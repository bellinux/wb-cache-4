5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E

The controversial bill was tabled in 2008 during the second session of the 39th Canadian Parliament by Minister of Industry Jim Prentice.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{enactment}} of Article 100, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted during the <b>Second</b> <b>Reading</b> of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill that the Singapore Constitution had no provisions for referring questions of constitutional interpretation to the courts for an advisory ruling, especially those relating to new and complex provisions of the Constitution.

However, they do not permit reference to other explanatory statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under these provisions are strictly the statements concerning the bill in question.|$|E

5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E
5|$|The Bill {{was then}} sent {{up to the}} House of Lords, a {{majority}} in which {{was known to be}} hostile to it. After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.|$|E
5|$|The Public Interest Disclosure Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons by Shepherd in 1997, and given its <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> on 12 December before being sent to a committee. After being passed by the Commons it moved to the House of Lords on 27 April 1998, and was passed on 29 June, receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July and becoming the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Originally scheduled to come into force on 1 January 1999, the Act instead became applicable law on 2 July.|$|E

50|$|Regular {{semantics}} are {{weaker than}} linearizability. Consider the example shown below, where the horizontal axis represents {{time and the}} arrows represent the interval during which a read or write operation takes place. According to a regular register's definition, the third read should return 3 since the read operation is not concurrent with any write operation. On the other hand, the <b>second</b> <b>read</b> may return 2 or 3, and the first read may return either 5 or 2. The first read could return 3 and the <b>second</b> <b>read</b> could return 2. This behavior would not satisfy atomic semantics. Therefore, regular semantics is a weaker property than an atomic semantics. On the other hand, Lamport proved that a linearizable register may be implemented from registers with safe semantics, which are weaker than regular registers.|$|R

5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform {{had grown so}} great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority {{in the general election}} of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its <b>second</b> <b>reading.</b> He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E
5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's <b>second</b> <b>reading,</b> and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E

It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but said nothing about limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E
5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two weeks}} of his {{appointment}} as Minister of Health Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought {{the abolition of the}} elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians which administered relief—and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a half}} hours on the <b>second</b> <b>reading</b> of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.|$|E
