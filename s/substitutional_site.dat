40|$|With {{molecular}} dynamics we {{have studied the}} deposition of single Co atoms on Ag(001) {{as a function of}} the energy of deposition on the surface. Co atoms were deposited with an energy between 5 and 30 eV, typically used for low-energy ion deposition. As a consequence of the impact, Co atoms that arrive on the surface mainly end up in two positions: either the adatom site or the <b>substitutional</b> <b>site</b> in the first Ag surface layer. The configuration energy of both sites is independent of the impact position and the deposition energy, indicating that not only the adatom site but also the <b>substitutional</b> <b>site</b> is thermodynamically stable. For increasing deposition energy the fraction of Co atoms ending up in a <b>substitutional</b> <b>site</b> increases. When a Co particle ends up in a <b>substitutional</b> <b>site,</b> this is accompanied with the creation of at least one Ag adatom. Under our experimental conditions, the direction of impact can differ considerably from the surface normal. Therefore, we also studied the influence of the impact angle between 0 degrees and 40 degrees off normal. When the deposition angle increases, the fraction of substitutional Co atoms as well as the fraction of created Ag adatoms decrease. status: publishe...|$|E

The most stable configurations can consist of tetrahedral, substitutional, {{or a combination}} of the two types of sites. In the dilute limit, Li, Na prefer interstitial, while Mg prefers <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites.</b> At higher concentrations of Li, Na, and Mg, there is a combination of interstitial and <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites.</b> This is an important finding, as previous ab initio studies of alloying type electrode materials ignored <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites.</b> Insertion energies computed at dilute concentration (x = 1 / 64) show that Na and Mg insertion are not thermodynamically favored in Ge vs formation of bulk Na and Mg, as opposed to Li insertion which is favored. We investigate the effect of p-doping of Ge (with Ga) on the thermodynamics and find that it considerably lowers the defect formation energies associated with the insertion of Li/Na/Mg at tetrahedral sites. On the other hand, the energetics associated with Li/Na/Mg insertion at <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites</b> are not significantly affected. In addition, we compute the migration energy barriers for Li/Na/Mg diffusion between two tetrahedral sites (0. 38 / 0. 79 / 0. 66 eV), between two <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites</b> (0. 77 / 0. 93 / 1. 83 eV), and between two sites of different type (2. 15 / 1. 75 / 0. 85 eV) ...|$|R

The primary Mg-rich precipitates were presumed to be Mg 3 N 2 [27, 28], which can be formed when Mg do not incorporate as acceptors in the desired <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites.</b> The <b>substitutional</b> Mg was suggested to be usually passivated by H during growth, and the corresponding Mg acceptor can be activated by postgrowth thermal annealing to dissociate the Mg[*]-[*]H complex [29].

Combinations of lattice vacancies, antisite atoms and host interstitials that form equilibrium defects are enumerated for the CsCl (B 2) and Ni 2 Al 3 structures. For CsCl, in addition to the two <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites,</b> a distorted tetrahedral interstitial site is considered. For Ni 2 Al 3, the Ni site, two distinct Al sites and a vacant, insterstitial-type Ni-site are considered. An equation of constraint among concentrations of elementary defects is derived that is valid for any crystal structure. The concentration of a selected defect can be solved using the equation of constraint in conjunction with mass-action equations for defect combinations. The method leads directly to defect concentrations without the need to evaluate composition-dependent chemical potentials, resulting in a more transparent formalism. The model is used to explore the phenomenology of site-preferences of dilute ternary solute atoms. Findings are in agreement with previous treatments restricted to <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites.</b> General rules for how site-preferences depend on temperature and on composition in non-stoichiometric compounds are obtained through algebraic analysis and numerical simulations: (1) Solute S tends to occupy <b>substitutional</b> <b>sites</b> of the element {{in which there is a}} deficiency. (2) If the difference of energies of S on sites A and B is very positive or negative, then S will occupy site B or A exclusively, independent of composition.
