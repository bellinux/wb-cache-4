5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> copper partly {{explains}} {{its high}} electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E

5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight {{simulator}} {{in which the}} player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. The tests presented to the player require {{him or her to}} complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded either a bronze, silver, or gold license {{based on the number of}} points attained. More difficult tests become available as the player progresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

40|$|Developing tactile {{displays}} is {{an important}} aspect of improving the realism <b>of</b> feeling <b>softness</b> in laparoscopic surgery. One of the major challenges of designing a tactile display is to understand how the perception of touch can be perceived with differences in material properties. This project seeks to address this limitation by investigating how the interaction of material properties affects perception <b>of</b> <b>softness</b> and to present the perception <b>of</b> <b>softness</b> through a tactile display. The first aim explores how the interaction of material properties affects perception <b>of</b> <b>softness</b> through the use of two psychophysical experiments. Experiments used a set of nine stimuli representing three materials of different compliance, with three different patterns of surface roughness or with three different coatings of stickiness. The results indicated that compliance affected perception <b>of</b> <b>softness</b> when pressing the finger, but not when sliding; and that compliance, friction and thermal conductivity all influenced the perception <b>of</b> <b>softness.</b> To achieve the second aim of reproducing various levels <b>of</b> <b>softnesses,</b> the tactile display was built at the University of Leeds. The displayed softness was controlled by changing the contact area and tension of a flexible sheet. Psychophysical experiments were conducted to evaluate how well humans perceive softness through the display. The data was analysed using MatLab to plot psychometric functions. The results indicated that the tactile display might be good for some applications which need to compare between simulated softnesses, but it might be insufficient for other applications which need to compare between simulated softness and real samples...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E
25|$|The western portal is {{decorated}} with special splendour. An important role in its decoration is played by the cantilevered stairs {{that lead to the}} upper level, with profiled butts to the steps. The doorways are framed with broad rectangular plaitbands, with ledges in the upper part, with columns, fillets and strips of various, mostly geometrical, fine and intricate patterns. Between the outer plathand and the arched framing of the openings there are representations of doves and sirens with women's crowned heads. Such reliefs were widely used in fourteenth-century Armenian art and in earlier times in architecture, miniatures and works of applied art, on various vessels and bowls. The entrance tympanums are decorated with bas-reliefs showing, on the lower tympanium, the Holy Virgin with the Child and Archangels Gabriel and Michael at her sides, and, on the upper tympanium, a half-length representation of Christ and figures of the Apostles Peter and Paul. As distinct from the reliefs of Noravank's vestry, these ones are carved on a plain surface, which gives them greater independence. The figures are distinguished by their plasticity of form, <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> modeling, and accentuation of certain details of clothing.|$|E
