In the spring of 2013, thirty-five educators in Atlanta, Georgia, including the former superintendent, principals, teachers, and testing coordinators were indicted for cheating on statewide-standardized tests.

The substance of standardized examinations, their common content, and the things they do not test are also explored. The relationship of good teaching to history and the corollary of research and teaching to defeat irrational thinking are considered. The paper also addresses what students and parents can do when they are confronted with <b>standardized</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Standardized</b> <b>tests</b> are characterized by "intellectual bias, irrationalism, racism, fatuous anticommunism, witless patriotism, the worship of capital, the fear of sexuality, and the justification of the way things are.

For example, <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> are used more than they ever were before to assess students' eligibility for grade promotion, graduation from high school, acceptance into institutions of higher learning, and many other important decisions. With such emphasis being placed on <b>standardized</b> <b>test</b> scores alone for the basis of many important decisions, some educators and educational theorists {{want to know if}} the <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> are reliable, valid, and unbiased. Many politicians and test-makers maintain that the tests do achieve their main goal of providing an accurate measure of students' academic performance. However, many parents, educators, and educational theorists believe that current <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> are too structurally flawed to accurately reflect students' academic abilities.
