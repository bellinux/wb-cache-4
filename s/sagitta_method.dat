40|$|Introduction: Due to German statuatory provisions, {{radiation}} exposure {{of patients in}} diagnostic X-ray procedures must be kept to a minimum. Medical X-ray diagnostics thus follow a principle of radiation protection known as ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable). To comply with this requirement, {{the field of view}} (FoV) must be adjusted as medically indicated before a CBCT image is taken. There are numerous and diverse recommendations concerning the adjustment of the FoV. However, these recommendations are not sufficiently based in science. As a result, there is a very high likelihood for inadequately chosen FoV. If the reproduced volume is too small, diagnostic value of the CBCT image may be lessened. On the other hand, too large a FoV would expose the patient to an unnecessarily high dose of X-ray radiation. This analysis investigates the required dimensions of FoV for 5 orthodontically relevant areas and identifies age and sex group specific differences in the sample population. Materials and methods: Anonymized DICOM records of 1000 patients were retrospectively evaluated using the digital volumetric imaging software Invivo 5. 1 (Anatomage Inc., San Jose, California). The dimensions of cylindrical FoV required for detecting bone reference points; bone and soft tissue reference points; bone reference points and the Corpus C 4; bone and soft tissue reference points and the Corpus C 4; and the dentition were determined. Before measurements were taken, the skulls were adjusted based on the Frankfurt horizontal plane to create a standardized starting position for all records. Whereas the height of the cylinder could be measured directly in the "Section View" mode, the cylinder diameter was calculated using the modified <b>sagitta</b> <b>method.</b> The the patients were evenly divided in 4 subgroups according to age (5 - 18 years, 19 - 75 years) and gender (male, female). The measurement results of the subgroups and required FoV were analyzed and compared. Results: The dimensions of the required FoV were 12. 88 x 16. 48 cm (young: 11. 94 x 15. 87 cm) for the detection of bone reference points, 14. 06 x 18. 55 cm (young: 12. 73 x 17. 54) for the detection of bone and soft tissue reference points, 12. 60 x 15. 87 cm for the detection of bone reference points and the vertebral body C 4, 12. 73 x 17. 54 cm for the detection of bone and soft tissue reference points and the Corpus C 4 and 7. 65 x 11. 15 cm (young: 7. 63 x 11. 15 cm) for the detection of the dentition. The FoV required for the different regions of interest and the individual patient groups differed significantly. Conclusions: The FoV has to be as small as possible to keep {{radiation exposure}} of patients to a minimum and as large as necessary to ensure the diagnostic capability of the X-Ray images taken. The analysis yielded sex and age specific measurements which can support the ALARA-compliant adjustment of fields of view for several regions of interest...|$|E
