25|$|Positive priming {{is thought}} to be caused by <b>spreading</b> <b>activation.</b> This means that the first {{stimulus}} activates parts of a particular representation or association in memory just before carrying out an action or task.

25|$|In {{semantic}} priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same semantic category and share features. For example, the word dog is a semantic prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized to work because of <b>spreading</b> <b>activation</b> within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.|$|E

25|$|TLC is an {{instance}} of a more general class of models known as semantic networks. In a semantic network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a specific concept, word, or feature. That is, each node is a symbol. Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as {{may be found in}} a neural network. The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes. Processing in a semantic network often takes the form of <b>spreading</b> <b>activation</b> (see above).|$|E
25|$|<b>Spreading</b> <b>activation,</b> {{a process}} where similar {{concepts}} are activated when their neighbors are activated, {{is a widely}} accepted model of lexical access. It {{has been shown in}} both bilingual and monolingual individuals, with bilinguals showing activation in both languages during language research tasks. Multiple studies have shown that bilinguals recognize cognate words more quickly than non-cognate words, especially identical cognates, which produce the strongest effect. These effects occurred even when the participants knew ahead of time what language the target words would be in. Despite the specific language contexts, both languages are activated, showing that lexical access is not language-specific and that top-down processing is important in lexical access. Findings suggest that the amount of activation that occurred cross-linguistically was related to the similarity between the translation equivalents of the languages.|$|E

2500|$|Age is an {{important}} factor when considering TOT states. There are complaints that problems recalling information increases with age. The frequency of TOTs increases in adulthood and even more so during the elderly years. Compared with young adults, older adults generally report having more TOT states, fewer alternate words, and less phonological information about the target word. The underpinnings of TOT with regard to age have focused on neurological brain differences. Current research uses neuroimaging methods to access the presence of different brain patterns when a younger and older individual is experiencing a TOT state. It is found that older and younger individuals employ a similar network of brain regions during TOT states such as the prefrontal cortex, left insula, and sensorimotor cortex. However, older individuals show differences in activity in some areas compared to younger individuals. TOTs increase with age-related gray matter loss in the left insula for older individuals. [...] This is accompanied by less activity in the left insula and is related to higher frequency of TOTs. Furthermore, it was found that older individuals have over-activation in their prefrontal cortex when experiencing TOT states. This may indicate a continued search when the retrieval process fails and a TOT state is experienced. More specifically, greater activation in the sensorimotor cortex in older individuals and less in younger adults may reflect differences in the knowledge that is used to retrieve the target information. Priming words during word retrieval tests generally reduces the frequency of TOTs and improves the retrieval of the target word and has been shown to have a larger benefit for older adults. This is consistent with the <b>spreading</b> <b>activation</b> model, where neural connections are strengthened when used more. [...] Although older people experience more tip of the tongue states more often than any other category, [...] recent studies have shown that frequent tip of the tongue states are not linked at all to dementia, which is common in the elderly. Despite the association of increased age with lower levels of episodic memory and more frequent TOT states, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{interactive}} activation framework proposed by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981), <b>activation</b> <b>spreads</b> both {{forward and backward}} between some levels of representation during visual word recognition. An important boundary condition, however, is that the <b>spread</b> of <b>activation</b> fromlower to higher levels can be prevented (e. g., explicit letter processing during prime processing eliminates the well-documented semantic priming effect). Can the <b>spread</b> of <b>activation</b> fromhigher to lower levels also be prevented? This question was addressed with a choice task procedure in which subjects read a prime word and then responded to a target, performing either lexical decision or letter search depending on {{the color of the}} target. A semantic context effect was observed in lexical decision, providing evidence of semantic-level activation. In contrast, there was no semantic context effect in the letter search task, despite evidence of lexical involvement: Words were searched faster than nonwords. Further evidence of lexical involvement in the letter search task appeared in Experiment 2 in the form of greater identity priming for words than for nonwords. The results of these experiments are consistent with the conclusion that feedback from the semantic level to the lexical level can be blocked.
