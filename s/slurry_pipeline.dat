25|$|Coal, {{petroleum}} {{and their}} derivatives are delivered by boat, rail, or road. Petroleum {{and natural gas}} may also be delivered by pipeline, and coal via a <b>Slurry</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Fuels such as gasoline and LPG may also be delivered via aircraft.

2500|$|Coal is {{delivered}} by highway truck, rail, barge, collier ship or coal <b>slurry</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Some plants are even built near coal mines and coal {{is delivered}} by conveyors. A large coal train called a [...] "unit train" [...] may be two kilometers (over a mile) long, containing 130-140 cars with 100 short tons of coal in each one, {{for a total}} load of over 15,000 tons. A large plant under full load requires at least one coal delivery this size every day. Plants may get {{as many as three}} to five trains a day, especially in [...] "peak season" [...] during the hottest summer or coldest winter months (depending on local climate) when power consumption is high. A large thermal power plant such as the now decommissioned Nanticoke, Ontario stores several million metric tons of coal for winter use when the lakes are frozen.|$|E
2500|$|The Polk County IGCC has design problems. [...] First, {{the project}} was {{initially}} shut down because of corrosion in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pipeline</b> that fed slurried coal from the rail cars into the gasifier. [...] A new coating for the pipe was developed. [...] Second, the thermocoupler was replaced {{in less than two}} years; an indication that the gasifier had problems with a variety of feedstocks; from bituminous to sub-bituminous coal. [...] The gasifier was designed to also handle lower rank lignites. [...] Third, unplanned down time on the gasifier because of refractory liner problems, and those problems were expensive to repair. [...] The gasifier was originally designed in Italy to be half the size of what was built at Polk. [...] Newer ceramic materials may assist in improving gasifier performance and longevity. [...] Understanding the operating problems of the current IGCC plant is necessary to improve the design for the IGCC plant of the future.

The ratio of coal to water is about 3 or 4 to 1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{practice}} used {{to prevent}} corrosion in buried <b>slurry</b> <b>pipelines</b> is the hibernation of pipelines with an aqueous solution containing corrosion inhibitors before beginning the mining operation. The aim of this work is to evaluate the corrosion resistance of API 5 L X 70 steel used in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pipelines</b> in hibernation solution containing sodium sulphite, sodium hydroxide and glutaraldehyde in a synthetic river water. The electrochemical techniques used are the Tafel analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synergistic effect {{of the components of}} hibernation solution on the corrosion resistance of the API 5 L X 70 steel was evaluated. A lower corrosion resistance was obtained for the API steel in aqueous solution of sodium sulphite, and in solution of sodium sulphite with glutaraldehyde. The hibernation solution was efficient in inhibiting steel corrosion but the highest corrosion inhibition efficiency was obtained with the glutaraldehyde aqueous solution...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model {{was developed in the}} present study to gain insight into the concentration profile of solid liquid <b>slurry</b> flow in <b>pipelines.</b> The preliminary simulations highlighted the need for the correct modeling of the interphase drag force. In light of the shortcomings of appropriate drag co-efficient model (namely Syamlal O’-Brien model, Gidaspow model and Wen & Yu model), an effort was made in the present study to modify the existing models to incorporate the effect of solid concentration at drag co-efficient. A two-dimensional user defined model was then developed using CFD to understand the influence of the particle drag coefficient on solid concentration profile. The proposed correlation was then incorporated in a two-fluid model (Euler-Euler) along with the standard k-ε turbulence model with mixture properties to simulate the turbulent solid-liquid flow in a pipeline. The predicted results show reasonably good agreement with the experimental data.
