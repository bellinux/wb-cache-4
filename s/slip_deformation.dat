40|$|Strike-slip faults evolve to {{accommodate}} more fault slip, resulting in less off-fault deformation. In analog experiments, the measured fault <b>slip</b> to off-fault <b>deformation</b> ratios {{are similar to}} those measured in crustal strike-slip systems, such as the San Andreas fault system. Established planar faults have the largest fault <b>slip</b> to off-fault <b>deformation</b> ratio of 0. 98. In systems without a pre-existing fault surface, crustal thickness and basal detachment conditions affect shear zone width and roughness. However, once the applied plate displacement is 1 - 2 times the crustal thickness, partitioning of <b>deformation</b> between fault <b>slip</b> and off-fault distributed shear is 3 ̆e 0. 90, regardless of the basal boundary conditions. In addition, at any moment during the evolution of the analog fault system, the ratio of fault <b>slip</b> to off-fault <b>deformation</b> is larger than the cumulative ratio. We also find that the upward and lateral propagation of faults as an active shear zone developing early in the experiments has greater impact on the system’s strike-slip efficiency than later interaction between non-collinear fault segments. For bends with stepover distance of twice the crustal thickness, the fault <b>slip</b> to off-fault <b>deformation</b> ratio increases up to 0. 80 - 0. 90, after applied plate displacement exceeds twice the crustal thickness. Propagation of new oblique-slip faults around sharp restraining bends reduces the overall off-fault deformation within the fault system.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the role of <b>slip</b> <b>deformation</b> on {{cavitation}} erosion, vibratory cavitation tests were carried out for a NiTi shape memory alloy in martensitic phase and austenitic phase. This alloy deforms plastically by the combination of slip and twinning deformation, and the erosion resistance of NiTi shape memory alloy is 500 to l 000 times {{higher than that of}} SUS 316 stainless steel. The erosion resistance of austenitic phase is superior to martensitic phase, because the accumulation of slip in the austenitic phase is slower due to the superelasticity than that in the martensitic phase. The martensitic phase test with intermittent shape recovery shows a better resistance without the shape recovery, since the deformation twins produced by cavitation erosion test are eliminated by shape recovery, resulting in the delay of slip accumulation. However, the amount of shape recovery was decreased with test duration. The decreasing rate of shape recovery has a good linear relationship with the volume loss rate.

40|$|Mixing of {{materials}} {{is fundamental to}} many natural phenomena and engineering applications. The presence of discontinuous deformations - such as shear banding or wall slip - creates new mechanisms for mixing and transport beyond those predicted by classical dynamical systems theory. Here we show how a novel mixing mechanism combining stretching with cutting and shuffling yields exponential mixing rates, quantified by a positive Lyapunov exponent, an impossibility for systems with cutting and shuffling alone or bounded systems with stretching alone, and demonstrate it in a fluid flow. While dynamical systems theory provides a framework for understanding mixing in smoothly deforming media, a theory of discontinuous mixing {{is yet to be}} fully developed.

40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) polycrystal intergranular {{model that}} accounts for grain boundary deformation and intergranular weakening at elevated temperatures is presented. The effects of grain boundaries on the accumulated <b>slip</b> <b>deformation</b> of grain interiors and lattice rotation have been investigated through a comparison between results from a model including grain boundary region (GBM) and a model representing only the grain interiors not the grain boundary region directly (NGBM). It is found {{that the presence of}} grain boundaries seems to suppress the grain interior <b>slip</b> <b>deformation,</b> and this suppressive role is reduced with increased relative thickness of the grain boundaries. In addition, grain boundaries promote the lattice rotation of individual grains in shear bands but suppress that of individual grains within non-shear bands. Mutual rotation of grains in both shear and non-shear bands is caused by the introduction of grain boundary regions. Rate-dependence of high-temperature plasticity could be more accurately captured by the GBM than by the NGBM. By considering creep damage of grain boundary, when the damage variable reaches a critical value, the corresponding grain boundary element is eliminated to describe dynamic intergranular fracture processes. The volume-averaged stress–strain curve by a model considering grain boundary damage (DGBM) showed better agreement with experimental results than that by a model not considering grain boundary damage (GBM) ...|$|E
