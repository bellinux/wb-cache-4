5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{failure of}} its industries, and the PRR reduced {{both local and}} long-distance service due to {{competition}} from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding parking lots and ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E

5|$|In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, {{built the}} first fixed visual {{telegraphy}} system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E

All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) {{began to}} land {{at the same time}} as the main {{elements}} of 5th Parachute Brigade, and <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same problems. All of its constituent units were scattered throughout the area due to poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop-zones either not being marked correctly or marked correctly but incorrectly positioned due to pathfinder error.|$|E
5|$|The Etna {{class was}} an {{improved}} {{version of the}} preceding Giovanni Bausan, being slightly larger but carrying the same armament and armor protection. License-built variants of the earlier ship, they were partially designed by George Rendel, who had also designed Giovanni Bausan. As such, they <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same limitations as the earlier vessel that were imposed by their slow-firing 10-inch guns and poor stability.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, {{at least until}} the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|By a Bangladeshi {{government}} ordinance on 2 October 1983, {{the project}} was authorised and established as an independent bank. Bankers Ron Grzywinski and Mary Houghton of ShoreBank, a community development bank in Chicago, helped Yunus with the official incorporation of the bank under {{a grant from the}} Ford Foundation. The bank's repayment rate <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> economic disruption following the 1998 flood in Bangladesh, but it recovered in the subsequent years. By the beginning of 2005, the bank had loaned over USD4.7billion {{and by the end of}} 2008, USD7.6billion to the poor.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were followed closely in the press. Outside of cricket, {{he worked for a}} brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E
5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same condition. Domery {{recalled}} {{that his father was}} a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but was too young to recall the quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A.

Dew also broke a wheel, but {{continued}} the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the Alaska Railroad {{purchased}} the Tanana Valley Railroad, which had <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wartime economic problems. The railroad line was extended westward, until {{it reached the}} town of Nenana and a construction party working north from Ship Creek, later renamed Anchorage. Until the railroad was finished and coal from Healy became available, Fairbanks burned wood as a heating source and to provide electricity. In 1913, the town burned between 12,000 and 14,000 cords of wood, with the Northern Commercial Company (owners of the power plant) burning 8,500 cords alone.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the opening of}} the American branch, various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of 0.15 per foot was standardized across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E
