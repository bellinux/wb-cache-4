5|$|On the maxi-catamaran Cheyenne (formerly named PlayStation), Fossett twice set {{the prestigious}} 24 Hour Record of Sailing. In October 2001, Fossett {{and his crew}} set a transatlantic record of 4 days 17 hours, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} record by 43 hours 35 minutes; an increase in average speed of nearly seven knots.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles {{encounters}} Rouge and Eggman, who try {{to steal}} the Master Emerald. He stops them by <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> emerald and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust.|$|E

5|$|A {{cannonball}} {{from the}} second French broadside struck Corbet within minutes of the first broadside, the ball tearing off his foot above the ankle just as a large wooden splinter thrown from the gunwale struck the thigh of the same leg, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> bone. Corbet was brought below to the ship's surgeon where the remnant of his leg was hastily amputated and bound, and command devolved on Lieutenant John Crew Tullidge. At 02:30, Astrée pulled away from Africaine to perform hasty repairs, but Bouvet's guns had wrecked Africaines rigging, leaving the British frigate uncontrollable and largely immobile. Slowly moving ahead, Africaine engaged Iphigénie at close range but was counter attacked by Astrée and found herself assailed on both sides, Astrée angled in such a position {{that she was able}} to rake the British ship, inflicting significant damage and casualties.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's only {{significant}} military defeat {{occurred during the}} Siege of Petersburg. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth attacked and overran the faulty Union position at Reams's Station, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> II Corps, capturing many prisoners. Despite a later victory at Hatcher's Run, the humiliation of Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November. He left the II Corps after {{a year in which}} it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial First Veteran Corps. He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in command of forces in the now-quiet Shenandoah Valley. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.|$|E

5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E
5|$|With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had {{to carry}} most of the load in her junior season, with help from {{returning}} teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class of Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 {{was supposed to be}} a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

25|$|On August 19, 2009, gunmen {{seized control}} of a bank in {{downtown}} Kabul one day before the Afghan election. The bold raid was the third major attack in Kabul in five days, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> capital city's relative calm since the last major attacks there in February. Police reported that three fighters and three policemen {{were killed in the}} four-hour-long siege.|$|E
25|$|In Bulgaria the All-Bulgarian Federation {{of unions}} chose to {{affiliate}} with the Profintern outright, {{but even that}} movement was split when opponents established a rival organization called the Free Federation of Trade Unions. Spain, too, saw its national labor movement formally divided. The climate was acrimonious as bitter charges and counter-charges levying responsibility for the <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> trade union movement flew in all directions.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August, Hamas coordinated {{a suicide}} {{attack on a}} crowded bus in Jerusalem killing 23 Israeli civilians, {{including}} 7 children.

25|$|Again, {{under the}} cover of intense aerial bombardment, US {{infantry}} and local Afghan forces attacked, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the vessels}} involved, {{the three most}} {{battered}} (the American brig Lawrence and the British ships Detroit and Queen Charlotte) were converted into hospital ships. A gale swept the lake on 13 September and dismasted Detroit and Queen Charlotte, further <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> already battered ships. Once the wounded had been ferried to Erie, Lawrence was restored to service for 1814, but the two British ships were effectively reduced to hulks.|$|E
25|$|The 1914 Saint John {{street railway}} strike (sometimes called the Saint John street railwaymen's strike) was a strike by {{workers on the}} street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22–24, 1914, with rioting by Saint John {{inhabitants}} occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.|$|E

25|$|Operation Yoav {{was headed}} by the Southern Front {{commander}} Yigal Allon. Committed to Yoav were three infantry and one armoured brigades, who were given the task of breaking through the Egyptian lines. The Egyptian positions were badly weakened {{by the lack of}} a defense in depth, which meant that once the IDF had broken through the Egyptian lines, there was little to stop them. The operation was a huge success, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian ranks and forcing the Egyptian Army from the northern Negev, Beersheba and Ashdod.|$|E
25|$|In the quarter-finals Lithuanians easily swept China 95–75, {{successfully}} {{qualifying for}} the semi-finals. The familiar Italian team awaited in the semi-finals. Lithuania started well, winning {{the first quarter}} 29–17, and leading 34–23 in the second. However, the Italians managed {{to take the lead}} before half time and a close game ensued. Lithuanians were able to tie the game in the third quarter (53–53) and even take the lead in the fourth (78–73); however, at the buzzer the Italians celebrated a 91–100 victory, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian dream of Olympic gold.|$|E
25|$|Police alleged the group's {{plan was}} to hijack a Boeing 747 and {{threaten}} to kill one passenger every hour until Manson and fellow Family members were released from prison. When a police squad car arrived, Share opened fire on the vehicle, <b>shattering</b> <b>the</b> windshield. As more squad cars arrived, they blocked the van from fleeing the scene, spraying it with over 50 bullets; the Family members fired nearly 20 rounds at the officers. When police finally gained control of the scene and apprehended the group, Mary Brunner, Catherine Share, and Larry Bailey were injured.|$|E
