40|$|Journal articleIn {{spite of}} the well known economic, <b>social,</b> and <b>sustainability</b> {{benefits}} of agroforestry systems, the adoption of agroforestry technologies continues to be very slow in developing countries. This {{is partly due to}} the design and implementation of agroforestry expansion programs, which rely heavily on the economic benefits and costs of agroforestry technologies, while the <b>social</b> and <b>sustainability</b> benefits remain unaccounted for. This paper is an attempt to incorporate <b>social</b> and <b>sustainability</b> benefits into the evaluation of agroforestry systems. Based on a case study of 200 farmers engaged in four types of agroforestry systems in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it shows that if the externalities associated with agroforestry were internalized, these systems would be more attractive as investments. The paper argues that the future evaluation of agroforestry systems should account for both private and societal benefits. IFPRI 3 COMP...|$|R
