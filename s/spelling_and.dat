500|$|Mutants and monsters have {{different}} <b>spells</b> <b>and</b> abilities {{depending on their}} battle experience and sub-class. These come in one of four categories: attack, non-combative, healing, and resistances/weaknesses. When used in combat, attack <b>spells</b> <b>and</b> abilities will damage a target by an elemental type, while non-combative <b>spells</b> <b>and</b> abilities inflict various status ailments (such as [...] "blindness") or grant benefits upon a target. Healing <b>spells</b> <b>and</b> abilities restore a target's HP {{and can be used}} outside of combat. Certain <b>spells</b> <b>and</b> abilities have added traits, like affecting a group of enemies or draining HP from a target. Each <b>spell</b> <b>and</b> ability has a finite number of uses, and once depleted the party must visit an inn to recharge them. Resistances and weaknesses are abilities that are active throughout combat. Represented by an [...] "O" [...] or [...] "X" [...] next to the related element or status ailment, they respectively give the user either resistance or weakness to one or more types of attack; status ailments grant immunity against a particular ailment.|$|R

5|$|The Swedish Language Council (Språkrådet) is the {{official}} regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the Académie française does for French. However, many organizations and agencies {{require the use of}} the council's publication Svenska skrivregler in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the glossary Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL, currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordbok, in addition to various books on grammar, <b>spelling</b> <b>and</b> manuals of style. Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language, their main purpose is to describe current usage.|$|E

5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori <b>Spelling</b> <b>and</b> Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
