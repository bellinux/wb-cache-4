5000|$|The {{windward}} <b>shore</b> is a lee <b>shore</b> for vessels traveling offshore, {{and that}} <b>shore</b> is [...] "to leeward" [...] of the vessel, {{but that does}} not make it the leeward <b>shore</b> of the island. Although the terms are often confused, [...] "the lee shore" [...] is different from [...] "a leeward shore" [...] based on the reference point from which the <b>shore</b> is viewed. Notice the different articles [...] "the" [...] and [...] "a" [...] — [...] "the" [...] windward or leeward <b>shore</b> versus [...] "a" [...] lee <b>shore.</b> The <b>shore</b> that is a lee <b>shore</b> changes based on the reference point, which is the vessel from which the island or lake <b>shore</b> is viewed, and of which the island or lake <b>shore</b> is in the lee. The leeward <b>shore</b> does not change based on the position of the vessel. This means that the [...] "leeward side" [...] of the vessel and the [...] "lee shore" [...] of the land face opposite directions.|$|R

5|$|The Adriatic's <b>shores</b> are {{populated}} {{by more than}} 3.5million people; the largest cities are Bari, Venice, Trieste and Split. The earliest settlements on the Adriatic <b>shores</b> were Etruscan, Illyrian, and Greek. By the 2nd century BC, the <b>shores</b> were under Rome's control. In the Middle Ages, the Adriatic <b>shores</b> and the sea itself were controlled, to a varying extent, {{by a series of}} states—most notably the Byzantine Empire, the Serbian Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria. Following Italian unification, the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century. Following World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the eastern coast's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania. The former disintegrated during the 1990s, resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia's successor states, but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian-Herzegovinian, and Montenegrin waters are still disputed. Italy and Albania agreed on their maritime boundary in 1992.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shore</b> (2003a) {{developed}} Inverse Normalizing Transformations (INTs) in {{the first}} years of the 21st century and has applied them to various engineering disciplines like statistical process control (<b>Shore,</b> 2000a, b, 2001a, b, 2002a) and chemical engineering (<b>Shore</b> at al., 2002). Subsequently, as the new Response Modeling Methodology (RMM) had been emerging and developing into a full-fledged platform for modeling monotone convex relationships (ultimately presented in a book, <b>Shore,</b> 2005a), RMM properties were explored (<b>Shore,</b> 2002b, 2004a, b, 2008a, 2011), estimation procedures developed (<b>Shore,</b> 2005a, b, 2012) and the new modeling methodology compared to other approaches, for modeling random variation (<b>Shore</b> 2005c, 2007, 2010; <b>Shore</b> and A’wad 2010), and for modeling systematic variation (<b>Shore,</b> 2008b).|$|R

5000|$|To {{someone on}} a vessel, the <b>shore</b> to lee {{of the vessel}} is the lee <b>shore,</b> and since that is the <b>shore</b> the wind reaches first, to someone on the <b>shore</b> it is the {{windward}} <b>shore.</b> [...] "Lee" [...] historically means [...] "shelter". Standing on the leeward side of the vessel, a sailor observes being blown towards an exposed shoreline by the wind. Here again the reference point from which a <b>shore</b> is viewed determines {{whether it is the}} lee <b>shore</b> or a leeward <b>shore.</b> On a lake, the reference point is a body of water, so the windward <b>shore</b> is upwind of the center of the lake. On an island, the reference point is a landmass, so the windward <b>shore</b> is the <b>shore</b> upwind (most to windward) of the center of the island. On a vessel, however, the windward rail is the one the wind is hitting first, or the one most upwind. The same is true regarding an island: the side of the island most to windward is the windward <b>shore.</b>|$|R
