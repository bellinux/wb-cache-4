40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of the radiance field estimated from bidirectional models {{derived from}} Nimbus 7 ERB scanner data is {{compared with the}} anisotropy observed with the ERB Experiment (ERBE) scanner aboard the ERB satellite. The results of averaging over groups of 40 ERBE scanner <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> for a <b>period</b> of a month revealed {{significant differences between the}} modeled and the observed anisotropy for given scene types and the sun-earth-satellite viewing geometries. By comparing the radiative fluxes derived using the observed anisotropy with those derived assuming isotropic reflection, it is concluded that a reasonable estimate for the maximum error due to the use of incorrect bidirectional models is a bias of about 4 percent for a typical 2. 5 deg latitude-longitude monthly mean, and an rms error of 15 percent...|$|R
50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode lines the scrolling region then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third line in the scrolling region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 2 to 7 (six <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight <b>scan</b> <b>lines),</b> and the final Mode <b>line</b> ends at <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 2 showing <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> 0 to 2 (three <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> or VSCROL + 1). The total <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> displayed in the scrolling region is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $00 - Double line resolution. ANTIC updates its DMA fetch address {{every other}} <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> and updates the CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern {{registers}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line,</b> {{so that each}} Player/Missile byte pattern is two <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) works by masking updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> which results in shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $00 - Double line resolution. New data is fetched by DMA on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> but {{an update}} to CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern {{registers}} still occurs on every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> Consequently, each Player/Missile byte pattern is two <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) {{can be used}} to mask ANTIC's updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vertical Fine Scrolling allows single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> {{movement}} of the scrolling region for Text and Map modes which are greater than one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> tall. Vertical Fine Scrolling for Map modes only one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical [...] "fine" [...] scrolling for single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse scrolling method.|$|R
5000|$|Kell factor {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the horizontal resolution that is required to match the vertical resolution attained by a given number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> For 576i at 50 Hz, given its 4:3 aspect ratio, the required horizontal resolution must be 4/3 times the effective vertical resolution, or (4/3)&times;0.7&times;576 = 537.6 pixels per line. Taken further, since 537.6 pixels is equal to a maximum of 268.8 cycles for an alternating pixel pattern, and given 576i 50 Hz has an active <b>line</b> <b>period</b> of 52µs, its luminance signal requires a bandwidth of 268.8/52 = 5.17 MHz.|$|R
50|$|When enabled, Player/Missile DMA {{occurs on}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> in the visible display—from <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 8 to 247. Therefore, the Player/Missile {{data in the}} memory map (see ANTIC's PMBASE) above and below those <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> counts is unused and undisplayed.|$|R
5000|$|Ability to {{independently}} shift each P/M object by one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> vertically when {{operating on}} double <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> per data.|$|R
50|$|This {{register}} is used {{to provide}} single <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> movement when Double Line Player/Missile resolution is enabled in ANTIC's DMACTL register. This works by masking ANTIC DMA updates to the GRAF* registers on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> causing the graphics pattern to shift down one <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since fine {{scrolling}} {{is based}} on <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> not pixel height, and scrolling region movement is done simply by skipping <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> from the first Mode <b>line</b> and adding <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> to the last Mode line, {{it is possible to}} use different graphics Modes within the scrolling region. This merely requires additional care when determining how many <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> can be shifted for the current first and last Mode lines in the scrolling region.|$|R
50|$|ANTIC's {{process of}} {{vertical}} fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip {{a number of}} <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> for the first mode line of the scrolling region. Subsequent Mode lines in the scrolling region are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the scrolling region displaying the number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> that {{were removed from the}} first line. This number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode <b>line's</b> <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine scrolling 16 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> from 0 to 15.|$|R
5000|$|... $10 - Single line resolution. A new DMA fetch and Player/Missile {{register}} update {{occurs on}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) masking the updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution {{to appear to}} be Double line resolution, though the data is shifted one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> lower.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} {{extent of the}} entire Playfield display varies between 0 and 240 scanlines - this depends {{on the number of}} lines ANTIC is programmed to display according to the Display List. ANTIC begins generating <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> at TV <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> 8 continuing to line 247 for a total of 240 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Descenders: ANTIC Mode 3. A {{modification}} of the Standard method. The method of pixel color display is the same. Each mode line is 10 scanlines tall, though the character glyph is still 8 bytes. Characters $00hex/0dec to $5Fhex/95dec display in the top 8 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> with two blank <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> added at the bottom. Characters $60hex/96dec to $7Fhex/127dec begin with two blank <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> at the top, and then display the glyph bytes in the bottom 8 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> The first two bytes in the glyph are moved to the bottom two <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> This allows a properly designed character set to display true descenders. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM.|$|R
5000|$|In the NTSC {{television}} standard, {{horizontal blanking}} occupies [...] (17.2%) {{out of every}} [...] <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> In PAL, it occupies [...] (18.8%) out of every [...] <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|This shape {{created a}} {{portrait}} image, {{instead of the}} landscape orientation that is common today. The position of a framing mask before the Nipkow disk determines the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> orientation. Placement of the framing mask at {{the left or right}} side of the disk gives vertical <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> Placement at the top or bottom of the disk gives horizontal <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vertical fine {{scrolling}} {{moves the}} scrolling region {{the number of}} <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> in a single Mode line of the scrolling region, up {{to a maximum of}} 16 <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> See VSCROL.|$|R
50|$|Since Single Line {{resolution}} requires ANTIC DMA {{updates on}} each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> and VDELAY masks the updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> then this bit reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution to Double line.|$|R
5000|$|... {{decoupling}} physical <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> {{from the}} 'logical' lines. The repeat count of physical <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> could be 0 to 15 per line (Due to interlacing a physical scan was two pixels high), ...|$|R
5000|$|In a raster scan, {{an image}} is {{subdivided}} into {{a sequence of}} (usually horizontal) strips known as [...] "scan lines". Each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> can be transmitted {{in the form of}} an analog signal as it is read from the video source, as in television systems, or can be further divided into discrete pixels for processing in a computer system. This ordering of pixels by rows is known as raster order, or raster scan order. Analog television has discrete <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> (discrete vertical resolution), but does not have discrete pixels (horizontal resolution) - it instead varies the signal continuously over the <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> Thus, while the number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> (vertical resolution) is unambiguously defined, the horizontal resolution is more approximate, according to how quickly the signal can change over the course of the <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{register}} specifies {{the distance}} of the Vertical fine scrolling in <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> The lowest 4 bits are significant, however the Vertical scroll value should range from 0 to the ANTIC Mode <b>line's</b> <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> height - 1. Scrolling farther than the ANTIC Mode's number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> results in lines of repeated data upsetting the fine scrolling continuity (though, this can also be used as an exploitable behavior).|$|R
50|$|Vertical Scrolling would ordinarily not be {{considered}} useful for ANTIC Mode F which is one <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> tall. However, if Vertical Scrolling is enabled for the Mode F Display List instruction, and the VSCROL register is set to 13, then ANTIC's line counter will count from 13 to 0 (four scan lines—13, 14, 15, 0). In doing so ANTIC outputs the same line of graphics for each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> from its internal buffer without re-reading the same screen memory again. The end of the vertical scrolling region needs to have VSCROL reset to 3 allowing ANTIC to count from 0 to 3 (four <b>scan</b> <b>lines).</b> The end result is a Mode F display where the <b>lines</b> are four <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall rather than one, but with the DMA overhead of only one screen memory data read occurring on the first <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $10 - Single line resolution. A DMA fetch and Player/Missile {{register}} update {{occurs on}} every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) which masks updates on even <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> effectively reduces Single line resolution to Double line resolution.|$|R
5000|$|Bit 4 (value $10hex/16dec) of the DMACTL {{register}} {{controls the}} frequency of new data retrieval. ANTIC retrieves data and updates CTIA/GTIA every <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> The DMACTL resolution settings affect how often ANTIC increments its internal DMA pointer for fetching new data. Single Line resolution Player/Missile graphics increments the DMA address every <b>scan</b> <b>line,</b> and Double Line resolution increments the DMA address with every even <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> The DMACTL bit values for Player/Missile resolution: ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> path, a {{conventional}} machining path, is frequently used in CNC machining. In the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> polishing process, the polishing tool offsets an interval at the boundary and continues the machining until the processing is done.|$|R
50|$|During {{this time}} Theremin was {{also working on}} a {{wireless}} television with 16 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> in 1925, improving to 32 <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> and then 64 using interlacing in 1926, and he demonstrated moving, if blurry, images on 7 June 1927.|$|R

5000|$|The {{number of}} blank <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> are {{specified}} by the value of Bits 4 through Bits 6 allowing a range from 0 through 7. ANTIC adds one to this value and displays the resulting number of <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> Instruction Values: ...|$|R
40|$|We develop {{efficient}} algorithms for low {{and intermediate}} level image processing on the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> array processor, a SIMD machine {{consisting of a}} linear array of cells that processes images in a <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> fashion. For low level processing, we present algorithms for block DFT, block DCT, convolution, template matching, shrinking, and expanding which run in real-time. By real-time, we mean that, if the required processing is based on neighborhoods of size m Θ m, then the output lines are generated {{at a rate of}} O(m) operations per line and a latency of O(m) <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> which is the best that can be achieved on this model. We also develop an algorithm for median filtering which runs in almost real-time at a cost of O(m log m) time per <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> and a latency of b m 2 c <b>scan</b> <b>lines.</b> For intermediate level processing, we present optimal algorithms for translation, histogram computation, scaling, and rotation.

50|$|The Vertical scroll value {{indicates}} the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> number {{to begin the}} display in the first Mode line and is also used as the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> number to end the display in the last Mode line (the line without the VS bit set).|$|R
5000|$|In {{facsimile}} systems, {{the cooperation}} {{factor is the}} product of the total image scanning length and the scanning density, given by CF = L σ, where L is the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> length and σ is the <b>scanning</b> <b>line</b> density, both in compatible units.|$|R

50|$|If a {{graphics}} {{object is}} being displayed while the DLI changes its value {{the results may}} be inconsistent. The most common example is changing the background color. Since the DLI begins executing while the electron beam is in a visible portion of the screen, {{the transition from the}} previous background color to the new color written by the DLI will be visible somewhere on the current <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> (The exact location varies based on DMA requirements for the display mode and Player/Missile graphics.) To produce a clean transition from <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> to <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> the code should first write to WSYNC which halts the DLI execution {{until the end of the}} <b>scan</b> <b>line,</b> and then write to the desired registers.|$|R
50|$|The term is used, by analogy, for {{a single}} row of pixels in a raster {{graphics}} image.Scan lines are important in representations of image data, because many image file formats have special rules for data {{at the end of}} a <b>scan</b> <b>line.</b> For example, there may be a rule that each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> starts on a particular boundary (such as a byte or word; see for example BMP file format). This means that even otherwise compatible raster data may need to be analyzed at the level of <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> in order to convert between formats.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{idea of a}} sprite with an image/pattern that varies vertically is {{also built}} into the Player/Missile graphics system. The ANTIC chip includes a feature to perform DMA to automatically feed new pixel patterns to CTIA/GTIA as the display is generated. This can be done for each <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> or every other <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> resulting in Player/Missile pixels one or two <b>scan</b> <b>lines</b> tall. In this way the Player/Missile object could be considered an extremely tall character in a font, 8 bits/pixels wide, by {{the height of the}} display.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{for each}} sub-area, {{gradient}} analysis is performed with four <b>scan</b> <b>lines,</b> and the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> directions are as follows: 0 o, 45 o, 90 o, 135 o, respectively, which are denoted as Li, i[*]∈[*][1,[*] 4]. When {{the frequency of}} change of the Li gradient quantized value is greater than three times, the <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> may pass through the text area. If {{there are more than}} one such <b>scan</b> <b>line</b> in the four sweep lines of the sub-area, the sub-area may be considered to contain text. Then, the address area is located, and the address area is located by using the connected element labeling algorithm. For all sub-regions that match the gradient feature are marked as pixel foreground, the other sub-regions are uniformly labeled as pixel background.|$|R
