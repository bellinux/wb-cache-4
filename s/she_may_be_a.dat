A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E

2500|$|NXT Senator Rebekha Sharkie, who had {{stated in}} July 2017 {{that she had}} renounced her UK {{citizenship}} prior to the election, said in November 2017 that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had advised her that {{a reference to the}} High Court might be required in relation to her possible dual-citizenship status at the close of nominations. Sharkie said that an application to renounce her UK citizenship had been submitted before the close of nominations, but the renunciation had not been registered by British authorities until after the close of nominations, although prior to the election; [...] she states that the notification of registration was received on 29 June. [...] She argues that she had taken [...] "all reasonable steps" [...] to renounce her citizenship. It has also been suggested that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> citizen of the United States (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Media Matters {{singled out}} MSNBC's Chris Matthews for his {{consistently}} harsh coverage of Clinton. [...] During the primaries, and {{especially after the}} Iowa caucuses, Matthews was openly enthusiastic about Obama's candidacy. The New Republic reported that Matthews was [...] "swooning" [...] over Obama {{in the days leading}} up to the January 8 New Hampshire Democratic primary. [...] On the night of that election, Matthews co-anchored MSNBC's coverage. Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow and political analyst Patrick Buchanan both noted the high turnout among women, and asserted that the media coverage made Clinton a sympathetic figure to female voters. Buchanan stated that the media had [...] "virtually canonized" [...] Obama and behaved as if he'd been [...] "born in Bethlehem." [...] Maddow told Matthews that several blogs were citing him as [...] "a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton." [...] She added that sites such as TalkingPointsMemo.com indicated that voters felt that the media were [...] "piling on" [...] Clinton, and were [...] "coming to her defense with their votes." [...] Matthews replied sarcastically, [...] "My influence in American politics looms over the people. I'm overwhelmed myself." [...] He added, [...] "I will never underestimate Hillary Clinton again." [...] The next day, Matthews appeared on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC morning show and said, [...] "I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> front-runner is her husband messed around. That's how she got to be senator from New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit." [...] While this incited more controversy, Matthews noted that Clinton's political career started after she appeared with Senator Chuck Schumer and impressed Democratic leaders with her graceful handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. [...] "I thought it was an unexceptional statement," [...] he said. These comments, among others, [...] led Media Matters to launch a campaign against him and his remarks.|$|E
