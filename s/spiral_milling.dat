40|$|<b>Spiral</b> jet <b>milling</b> is a size {{reduction}} process used in various industries, ranging from paints to food and pharmaceuticals. It has great benefit in {{the pharmaceutical industry}} due to its ability to reduce particulate solids to micron sizes and narrow size distributions. Despite its heavy usage, the underlying {{size reduction}} mechanism of the mill is not well understood. However it is generally known that the milling behaviour {{is dependent on the}} grinding conditions of the mill, as well as the materials physical and mechanical properties. The system is also very energy inefficient. In this work the milling behaviour of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients in the <b>spiral</b> jet <b>mill</b> has been analysed based on their mechanical properties, as established from the Ghadiri and Zhang semi-brittle breakage model. Using the Single Particle Impact Test Rig, the breakability index (αH/KC 2) of three pharmaceutical materials (paracetamol, aspirin, and α-lactose monohydrate) is determined. It is shown that the order of breakability is paracetamol > aspirin > α-lactose monohydrate. For milling studies the Hosokawa Alpine Aeroplex <b>Spiral</b> Jet <b>Mill</b> 50 AS is used. The change in specific surface area (ΔSSA) due to milling is quantified by size analysis and related to the breakability indices. The order of ΔSSA is α-lactose monohydrate > paracetamol > aspirin at high grinding pressure conditions. The loading of particles in the grinding chamber of the mill is found to be an important characteristic for the classification of milled materials in addition to the effects of centrifugal and drag forces. Numerical simulations have been carried out and used to analyse the behaviour of the <b>spiral</b> jet <b>mill.</b> Using Computational Fluid Dynamics, the mechanics of internal particle classification by size of the 50 AS has been analysed. Particles of 2 µm and less are shown to be classified. The Discrete Element Method is coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics to investigate the effect of grinding conditions and particle properties on the particle motion and fluid-particle energy transfer, including gas pressure, the number of particles and the particle size distribution. A very small amount of energy is transferred to the particles from the fluid, highlighting the energy inefficiency of the system. Interparticle interactions are found to have a greater amount of dissipated energy compared to particle-wall interactions, which suggests interparticle collisions are the primary source of particle breakage. The majority of the stress exerted on the particles is close to the wall of the mill, with the normal stress being greater than the shear stress. A very low proportion of particles are found to be in contact at a given time, indicating particle breakage occurs from instantaneous collisions rather than particles shearing against each other. Finally the potential for scale-up of the <b>spiral</b> jet <b>mill</b> is investigated based on the fluid power input to the system. There is a good comparison of the ΔSSA of α-lactose monohydrate milled in four different mills at similar fluid power input conditions. Two of the mills are the 50 AS and the Hosokawa Alpine Piconizer (33 AS), and the other two are of different design but with internal diameters of 2 inches and 4 inches, i. e. roughly similar size to the Hosokawa mills. The latter two mills had a greater fluid power as the grinding nozzle diameters are larger than the Hosokawa mills...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In some {{surgical}} specialties (eg, orthopedics), robots {{are already}} {{used in the}} operating room for bony milling work. Otological surgery and otoneurosurgery may also greatly benefit from the enhanced precision of robotics. Study Design: Experimental study on robotic milling of oak wood and human temporal bone specimen. Methods: A standard industrial robot with a six-degrees-of-freedom serial kinematics was used, with force feedback to proportionally control the robot speed. Different milling modes and characteristic path parameters were evaluated to generate milling paths based on computeraided design (CAD) geometry data of a cochlear implant and an implantable hearing system. Results: The best-suited strategy proved to be the <b>spiral</b> horizontal <b>milling</b> mode with the burr held perpendicular to the temporal bone surface. To reduce groove height, the distance between paths should equal half the radius of the cutting burr head. Because of the vibration of the robot’s own motors, a high oscillation of the SD of forces was encountered. This oscillation dropped drastically to nearly 0 Newton (N) when the burr head made contact with the dura mater, because of its damping characteristics. The cutting burr could be kept in contact with the dura mater for an extended period without damaging it, because of the burr’s blunt head form. The robot moved the burr smoothly according to the encountered resistances. Conclusion: The study reports the first development of a functional robotic milling procedure for otoneurosurgery with force-based speed control. Future plans include implementation of ultrasound-based local navigation and performance of robotic mastoidectomy...|$|R

40|$|Although jetmilling {{is a very}} energy {{consuming}} grinding process it is increasingly used in industry because very fine grinding product with a narrow size distribution is attained without contamination as the milling occurs by inter particle collisions. At Delft University a project has been started to achieve a considerable energy reduction of the milling process. Main feature of the improved grinding system will be an operation control based on in-line particle size measurement using the laser diffraction technique. The pilot plant is equipped with an external classifier for the removal and recirculation of larger particles leaving the jet mill. Phenomena occurring in the mill are not yet well modeled and thus no real optimization of the grinding process can be achieved. Operation conditions of jet mills are still determined by trial and error. This paper is to {{form the basis of}} a model which allows a dynamic modeling of the behavior of the jet mill/classifier system. The closed loop grinding system has been split in 3 subsystems (zones), two internal to the mill and one external through which the particles pass. Exchange of particles is not described by complicated residence time distribution functions but by “particle size ” dependent probability functions. 1. Intmduction In a <b>spiral</b> jet <b>mill</b> high pressure air (7 bar) is tangentially injected in the mill chamber creating a rotating flow (see Fig. 1). Solids fed in the mill chamber are transferred to the outer zone where they are hit by jets. Size reduction is caused by mutual collisions. Fine particles are dragged to the central outlet. In a jet mill optimization for grinding and classification performance can not be achieved simultaneously, because this jet mill is normally operated {{in such a way that}} the number of particles larger than the desired product size is minimized. This leads to a highly inefficient grinding process in terms of energy consumption...|$|R

Using the lumped parameter method to simplify the main drive shaft, the lumped mass model and the force model were been obtained. When bending vibrating, the natural frequency of the main drive shaft is calculated using the transfer matrix method. The calculated critical speed is 43755 r/min, which far outweighs the motor rated speed. It means that the drive shaft under normal work won't be resonance, which accords with the request of production.

40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} usually are {{cut by the}} machine tools which are {{specifically}} made for manufacturing spiral bevel gear. For some practical applications, such as repair, prototype, and small batch, there are only several spiral bevel gears need to be machined. It seems not wise to buy a gear manufacturing machine tool for cutting those several gears. Consequently, some other manufacturing methods are introduced {{to cope with this}} situation. Recent advances in computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine tools make it possible to manufacture good quality spiral bevel gears. Moreover, CNC milling machine tools are usually cheaper than the specific gear manufacturing machine tools. Even more, they are not only cut gears but also other parts. Therefore, computer numerical control (CNC) milling is introduced in industry to cut spiral bevel gears. End milling and flank milling are two modes of CNC milling. Compared to end milling, flank milling has been highlighted in quality enhancement, manufacturing time and cost reduction. Theoretically, the result of flank milling a developable ruled surface does not contain geometric deviations. Hence, flank milling has been widely used to machine the parts with ruled surface or the surface close to ruled surface, such as turbines and blades. Due {{to the fact that the}} tooth surfaces of spiral bevel gears are close to ruled surface (the tooth surface of Format-cut spiral bevel is part of a cone), flank milling can also be used to cut spiral bevel gears. However, there is no literature about flank <b>milling</b> <b>spiral</b> bevel gears. Moreover, the current existing tooth surface models (except the tooth surface of Format-cut spiral bevel gear) are implicit, which makes further calculation inefficient and difficult. To address these two problems, a new ruled tooth surface design is proposed to spiral bevel gears design. Subsequently, the design model is used to be machined with five-axis flank milling by introducing a new tool path planning approach. To obtain the simulate machined tooth surface, a new geometric envelope approach is proposed to calculate the cutter envelope surface as a closed-form representation. Then the result of geometric deviations, which are obtained by comparing the design tooth surface and the simulate machined tooth surface, shows the flank milling is appropriate to cut spiral bevel gears. Furthermore, the conventional face-milled model is also used as the design model for flank milling, and another result of geometric deviations is obtained. Subsequently, both results are compared, and the comparison shows that the proposed design reduces the geometric deviations effectively. Moreover, the closed-form simulate machined tooth surface can only be obtained by using the proposed design...|$|R
