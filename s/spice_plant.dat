40|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} medicinal and spice plants in the organic agriculture system is {{an alternative to the}} conventional farming system, promoting environmentally friendly agricultural technologies which exclude synthetical chemicals, as well as healthy agricultural products that ensure consumers ’ health, environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources. The organic farming system is particularly important as it includes the production of medicinal and spice plants which are intended primarily to guarantee consumers ’ health; bt definition, these plants must be free of synthetic chemical residues (pesticides and chemical fertilizers). Medicinal and spice plants also have an economic importance since they can {{contribute to the development of}} sustainable agriculture in the context of natural resource depletion and constant population growth. Poverty in rural and urban areas can lead to health problems that can be treated by medicinal plants. Their high content in various active substances, such as essential oils, natural antioxidants, etc., provide natural sources for humankind’s health. The PhD thesis is aimed at highlighting the major role of ecological agriculture in the present national and international context, as well as the importance of growing medicinal and spice plants in an ecological system. The research carried out within the doctoral studies was aimed at studying several medicinal and <b>spice</b> <b>plant</b> species that are grown under organic agriculture conditions in southern Romania, and at observing fertilization by products that are accepted by the organic agriculture system and are applied to the studied medicinal and <b>spice</b> <b>plant</b> species.

40|$|The paper {{presented}} examines how useful plants can help counteracting “plant blindness” – a phenomenon leading people to overlook plants in everyday-life. Recent {{research indicates that}} people are most likely interested in useful plants, hence this group of plants {{could be used to}} trigger interest in botanical content in general. This study has investigated the structure of interest in five subgroups of useful plants (medicinal plants, stimulant herbal drugs, <b>spice</b> <b>plants,</b> edible plants, and ornamental plants). For this purpose, the FEIN-questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Erhebung des Interesses an Nutzpflanzen = Questionnaire acquiring interest in useful plants) was filled in by N =  1299 pupils from grade 5 to 12. Data analysis shows (for all age groups and both genders) that medicinal plants and stimulant herbal drugs trigger high interest while <b>spice</b> <b>plants,</b> edible plants and ornamental plants raise only lower interest. However, mean values do not allow conclusions on individual level (e. g. in a school class). In order to gain information about the interest structure in a specific target group teachers deal with in practice, we have analysed the interests on individual level using frequency analysis of different interest types. Results show that stimulant herbal drugs seem to strongly polarize students, whereas medicinal plants are interesting for almost the whole sample. Eventually, medicinal plants turned out to be well suited to introduce botanical content by means of plants catching the interest of as many students as possible.
