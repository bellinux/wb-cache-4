5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

30|$|Spectrum {{aggregation}} is {{an emerging}} technology {{to satisfy the}} data rate requirement of broadband services for next-generation wireless communication systems. In dynamic spectrum environment, in which the spectrum availability is time-varying, it is quite challenging to maintain the stability of spectrum aggregation. In this paper, we investigate the spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> access schemes to minimize the times of channel switching for achieving stable dynamic spectrum aggregation, taking into consideration the hardware limitations of spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> aggregation capability. We develop an analytical framework for the joint spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> access problem based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Especially, we derive the reward function by estimation of the stability of different spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> access strategies. Based on the POMDP framework, we propose a rollout-based suboptimal spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> access scheme which approximates the value function of POMDP, and propose a differential training method to improve its robustness. It is proved that the rollout policy achieves performance improvement over the basis heuristics. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed POMDP-based spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> access scheme improves the system stability significantly and achieves near-optimal performance with a much lower complexity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the paradigm of}} interactive <b>and</b> cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> control as a fundamental mechanism of integrating and fusing the strengths of man and machine for advanced teleoperation.

The emphasis of interactive <b>and</b> cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> control {{is given to the}} distribution of mutually nonexclusive subtasks to man and machine, the interactive invocation of subtasks under the man/machine symbiotic relationship, and the fusion of information and decision-making between man and machine according to their confidence measures. The proposed interactive <b>and</b> cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>and</b> control system is composed of such major functional blocks as the logical sensor system, the sensor-based local autonomy, the virtual environment formation, and the cooperative decision-making between man and machine.

He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
