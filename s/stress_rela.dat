40|$|Stringent {{response}} is a conserved bacterial stress response underlying virulence and antibiotic resistance. RelA/SpoT-homolog proteins synthesize transcriptional modulators (p) ppGpp, allowing bacteria {{to adapt to}} <b>stress.</b> <b>RelA</b> is activated during amino-acid starvation, when cognate deacyl-tRNA binds to the ribosomal A (aminoacyl-tRNA) site. We report four cryo-EM structures of E. coli RelA bound to the 70 S ribosome, in the absence and presence of deacyl-tRNA accommodating in the 30 S A site. The boomerang-shaped RelA with a wingspan of more than 100 A wraps around the A/R (30 S A-site/RelA-bound) tRNA. The CCA end of the A/R tRNA pins the central TGS domain against the 30 S subunit, presenting the (p) ppGpp-synthetase domain near the 30 S spur. The ribosome and A/R tRNA are captured in three conformations, revealing hitherto elusive states of tRNA engagement with the ribosomal decoding center. Decoding-center rearrangements are coupled with the step-wise 30 S-subunit 2 ̆ 7 closure 2 ̆ 7, providing insights into the dynamics of high-fidelity tRNA decoding...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunistic}} {{human pathogen}} Vibrio vulnificus survives {{in a wide}} range of ecological environments, which demonstrates its ability to adapt to highly variable conditions. Survival and gene expression under various conditions have been extensively studied in vitro; however, little work has been done to evaluate this bacterium in its natural habitat. Therefore, this study monitored the long-term survival of V. vulnificus in situ and simultaneously evaluated the expression of <b>stress</b> (rpoS, <b>relA,</b> hfq, and groEL) and putative virulence (vvpE, smcR, viuB, and trkA) genes at estuarine sites of varying salinity. Additionally, the survival and gene expression of an rpoS and an oxyR mutant were examined under the same conditions. Differences between the sampling sites in the long-term survival of any strain were not seen. However, differences were seen in the expression of viuB, trkA, and relA but our findings differed from what has been previously shown in vitro. These results also routinely demonstrated that genes required for survival under in vitro stress or host conditions are not necessarily required for survival in the water column. Overall, this study highlights the need for further in situ evaluation of this bacterium in order to gain a true understanding of its ecology and how it relates to its natural habitat...|$|R
40|$|The RelA-mediated {{stringent}} {{response is}} at the heart of bacterial adaptation to starvation and stress, playing a major role in the bacterial cell cycle and virulence. RelA integrates several environmental cues and synthesizes the alarmone ppGpp, which globally reprograms transcription, translation, and replication. We have developed and implemented novel single-molecule tracking methodology to characterize the intracellular catalytic cycle of RelA. Our single-molecule experiments show that RelA is on the ribosome under nonstarved conditions and that the individual enzyme molecule stays off the ribosome for an extended period of time after activation. This suggests that the catalytically active part of the RelA cycle is performed off, rather than on, the ribosome, and that rebinding to the ribosome is not necessary to trigger each ppGpp synthesis event. Furthermore, we find fast activation of RelA in response to heat <b>stress</b> followed by <b>RelA</b> rapidly being reset to its inactive state, which makes the system sensitive to new environmental cues and hints at an underlying excitable response mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Background. Although several {{reports have}} focused on the {{clinical}} importance of the systemic microinflammatory state in the uraemic population, the relationship between the activation of a specific transcriptome and the development of this condition is still not completely defined. Methods. Thirty haemodialysis (HD), 30 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 30 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were enrolled in our study. For all patients, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels were determined. In addition, the expression level of 234 inflammatory responses and oxidative stress pathway genes was measured, using oligonucleotide microarray chips (HG-U 133 A, Affymetrix), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 24 randomly selected patients (8 HD, 8 PD and 8 CKD). Results. HD patients demonstrated higher CRP and ferritin levels compared to PD and CKD patients (P < 0. 001). Statistical analysis identified 10 genes able to discriminate CKD from HD and PD patients (FDR = 5 %, P < 0. 001) and significantly correlated to CRP levels. All together, these genes were able to predict inflammation with an accuracy of 87 % (P < 0. 001). Among the selected genes there were those encoding for key regulators of inflammation and oxidative <b>stress</b> (e. g. <b>RELA,</b> GSS). Interestingly, only three inflammatory genes (MIF, IL 8 RB and CXCL 12) were still significantly associated with inflammation when included in a multivariate analysis. RT-PCR for RELA, MIF, CXCL 12 and western blots for IL 8 RB and GSS, using 66 patients, validated the microarray results. Conclusions. This study may help to better understand the physiopathology of the systemic inflammatory state in CKD and dialysis patients and to identify new target genes potentially useful for future bio-molecular studies and therapeutic approaches...|$|R
