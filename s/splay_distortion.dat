40|$|We present {{detailed}} systematic {{studies of}} structural transformations in thin liquid crystal films with the smectic-C to hexatic phase transition. For {{the first time}} all possible structures reported in the literature are observed for one material (5 O. 6) at the variation of temperature and thickness. In unusual modulated structures the equilibrium period of stripes is twice with respect to the domain size. We interpret these patterns in the frame work of phenomenological Landau type theory, as equilibrium phenomena produced by a natural geometric frustration in a system having spontaneous <b>splay</b> <b>distortion.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Open Access. We {{report on}} two {{anomalous}} {{trends in the}} temperature dependences of the splay (K 11) and bend (K 33) elastic constants in the nematic (N) phase of mixtures of compounds with rodlike (R) and bent-core (BC) molecules: As the sample is cooled from the isotropic to N transition point, (i) K 33 increases, attains a maximum value and then decreases, and (ii) close to the N to smectic A (SmA) transition point, K 11 decreases sharply. At higher temperatures the bow axes of BC molecules are aligned along the director n^, strongly favoring a bend distortion of n^ as the orientational order parameter is increased. Close to the N-SmA transition point the smecticlike short-range order builds up, and the arrow axes of BC molecules are aligned along n^, facilitating a <b>splay</b> <b>distortion</b> of n^. A simple model calculation brings out the anomalous trend in K 33...|$|E
40|$|Lonberg and Meyer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 718 (1985) ] have {{recently}} discovered in polymer nematics {{the existence of}} a critical value rc= 0. 303 for the ratio r=K 2 /K 1 between the twist and splay Frank elastic constants, below which a periodic splay-twist distortion is energetically favored with respect to the well-known aperiodic <b>splay</b> <b>distortion</b> which appears in a Fr√©edericksz transition. In this paper the effect of weak-anchoring conditions on the critical r value and on the other parameters of interest is theoretically investigated. Analytical expressions between these parameters are given. It is shown that the periodic transition is not allowed in the range 0. 5 <r< 2. Outside this range either the periodic or aperiodic transition appears, according to the surface treatment, the sample thickness, and the direction of the magnetic field. Hence the critical value of r can be controlled in a wide range...|$|E

In this paper, inspired by microscopic theoretical treatment of phases in liquid crystals, we introduce a novel mathematical framework, called Director Field Analysis (DFA), to study local geometric structural information of white matter from the estimated tensor field or spherical function field. 1) We propose Orientational Order (OO) and Orientational Dispersion (OD) indices {{to describe the}} degree of alignment and dispersion of a spherical function in each voxel; 2) We estimate a local orthogonal coordinate frame in each voxel with anisotropic diffusion; 3) Finally, we define three indices to describe three types of orientational <b>distortion</b> (<b>splay,</b> bend, and twist) in a local spatial neighborhood, and a total distortion index to describe distortions of all three types. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} work to quantitatively describe orientational <b>distortion</b> (<b>splay,</b> bend, and twist) in diffusion MRI.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control the {{movement}} and assembly of particles in liquid crystals {{is not only an}} important route to design functional materials, but also sheds light on the mechanisms of colloidal interactions. In this study we place micron-sized particles with "Saturn ring" defects near a wall with hills and dales that impose perpendicular (homeotropic) molecular anchoring. The strong <b>splay</b> <b>distortion</b> at the wall interacts with the distortion around the particles in the near field and favors their migration towards the dales via the so-called "lock-and-key" mechanism. We demonstrate experimentally that the lock-and-key mechanism can robustly localize a particle at specific topographical features. We observe the complex trajectories traced by the particles as they dock on the dales, estimate the binding energy, and explore a range of parameters that favor or disfavor the docking event, thus exploiting the capabilities of our experimental system. We extend the study to colloids with homeotropic anchoring but with an associated point defect instead of a Saturn ring and show that they find a different preferred location, i. e. we can place otherwise identical particles at well defined sites according to their topological defect structure. Finally, for deep enough wells, confinement drives topological transitions of Saturn rings to dipoles. This ability to tailor wall geometry to guide colloids to well defined sites within nematic liquid crystals represents an important new tool in directed assembly. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Liquid crystal {{elastomers}} {{realize a}} fascinating {{new form of}} soft matter that is a composite of a conventional crosslinked polymer gel (rubber) and a liquid crystal. These solid liquid crystal amalgams, quite similarly to their (conventional, fluid) liquid crystal counterparts, can spontaneously partially break translational and/or orientational symmetries, accompanied by novel soft Goldstone modes. As a consequence, these materials can exhibit unconventional elasticity characterized by symmetry-enforced vanishing of some elastic moduli. Thus, a proper description of such solids requires an essential modification of the classical elasticity theory. In this work, we develop a rotationally invariant, nonlinear theory of elasticity for the nematic phase of ideal liquid crystal elastomers. We show that it is characterized by soft modes, corresponding {{to a combination of}} long wavelength shear deformations of the solid network and rotations of the nematic director field. We study thermal fluctuations of these soft modes in the presence of network heterogeneities and show that they lead to a large variety of anomalous elastic properties, such as singular length-scale dependent shear elastic moduli, a divergent elastic constant for <b>splay</b> <b>distortion</b> of the nematic director, long-scale incompressibility, universal Poisson ratios and a nonlinear stress-strain relation fo arbitrary small strains. These long-scale elastic properties are universal, controlled by a nontrivial zero-temperature fixed point and constitute a qualitative breakdown of the classical elasticity theory in nematic elastomers. Thus, nematic elastomers realize a stable "critical phase", characterized by universal power-law correlations, akin to a critical point of a continuous phase transition, but extending over an entire phase.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} effects of shape anisotropy on the evolved microstructure of diblock copolymers at various levels. Due to chain connectivity and microphase separation, the diblock copolymers self-assemble into ellipsoidal grains of lamellar and cylindrical morphologies. A grain-structure related phenomenon, Excluded Volume Epitaxy (E. V. E.) is explored in Chapter 2. E. V. E. is a local, inter-grain azimuthal orientational correlations effect, which results {{from a combination of}} sporadic nucleation and impingement of growing anisotropic shaped grains. Due to E. V. E., the ellipsoidal grains have a propensity for similar orientations in a local neighborhood, despite complete absence of global orientation in the sample. Simulations and experiments have verified this effect. ^ The Avrami kinetics of anisotropic shaped grains is discussed in Chapter 3. Traditionally Avrami equation is used to model the growth kinetics of volume filling isotropic shaped grains. The probabilistic nature of Avrami kinetics produces a coupling between the grain shape and Poisson distribution. The Poisson-shape coupling remains latent for isotropic grains but becomes operative for anisotropic grains in random orientations scheme leading to inhibited growth kinetics. For unidirectional orientation of anisotropic grains, the growth kinetics remains uninhibited due to absence of Poisson-shape coupling. For two-dimensional case in simultaneous and continuous nucleation regimes, the inhibited kinetics scales as L 1 / 2 where L is the shape anisotropy. ^ The blends of highly shape anisotropic nanoclay, montmorillonite (MMT) and lamellar poly(styrene-b-isoprene), PS-PI are discussed in Appendix A. Annealing and cooling is sufficient to produce long-range lamellar order at 1 wt % clay loading. However at 5 wt % clay loading, shear force is additionally required. This system reveals the effect of shape anisotropy on evolution of long-range order in clay-block copolymer blends. ^ The effect of shape anisotropy of polymer chain in the context of rod-coil block copolymer is explored in Appendix B. Poly(styrene-b- 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene), PS-PCHD self-assembles into core-shell cylinder structure, seen rarely in AB diblock copolymers. A rod-coil free energy model that incorporates liquid crystalline <b>splay</b> <b>distortion</b> energy in the rod phase is presented. In this model, the PCHD block is treated as rod to explain the stability of the core-shell cylinder structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The flexoelectric e#ect {{in liquid}} {{crystals}} [1] concerns the linear coupling of splay and bend director deformations to an electric polarization. Flexoelectric liquid crystal materials exhibit a polarization P {{proportional to the}} orientational deformation of the director field n, P = e_ 11 n div n + e_ 33 n curl n, (1) where e_ 11 and e_ 33 denote the flexoelectric coe#cients related to <b>splay</b> and bend <b>distortions,</b> respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the structure, properties, and processing of various {{liquid crystal polymer}} systems. Morphologies of microphase separated side chain liquid crystal block copolymers are determined, both in the bulk and when confined to thin films. We show {{for the first time}} how these materials could potentially be used as a novel kind of surface stabilized liquid crystal display device. Magnetic field induced structures in a thermotropic main chain liquid crystal homopolymer were also examined. Defects in orienting fields are of interest because liquid crystal displays must be defect free over large areas. A study of the interaction of defects in an applied field yields information towards optimally processing these materials in order to minimize or completely eliminate these defects. The basic building block of the systems investigated is a liquid crystal mesogen. Liquid crystal mesogens are easily oriented by electric, magnetic, and flow fields and interact with polarized light such that they are desirable materials for display devices. Additionally, these systems are all polymeric, lending the complexity of the molecules' long-chain nature to the material properties, and the resulting processing challenges and mechanical advantages inherent to polymers. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) are the tools employed. Two-dimensional Ndel inversion walls formed in a nematic monodomain during magnetic realignment of a highly elastically anisotropic thermotropic liquid crystal polyether are examined via PLM and AFM. (cont.) he elastic anisotropy is defined as [epsilon] [approximately equal to] (kll 1 - k 33) /(kll + k 33), where kll is the Frank elastic constant for <b>splay</b> <b>distortions</b> and k 33 is the Frank elastic constant for bend distortions. For this polymer, [epsilon] [approximately equal to] + 0. 5; kll - 3 k 33. Following PLM examination, the detailed director patterns of these walls are imaged at high-resolution by AFM through a lamellar decoration technique, employed after walls have been fixed by quenching while under field. Walls form as closed loops comprised of a continuous inversion wall with antiparallel director alignment of the interior region with respect to that of the exterior. The energy of N 6 el walls is theoretically evaluated as a function of elastic anisotropy. In our experimental system, the energy of a splay wall is 17 % higher than that of a bend wall. The variation of the characteristic width of walls in this polyether as measured by AFM yields an effective elastic constant of 1. 6 x 10 - 6 dynes at 160 √¢¬Å¬∞C. Inversion wall dynamics may be followed through time-under-field experiments. Loops coalesce, shrink, and smooth their curvature, occasionally splitting into a partial loop terminated by two opposite strength 1 / 2 disclinations. The observed more rapid shrinkage of splay distortion-rich wall segments as compared to that of bend-rich wall segments corresponds to the expected wall energetics based on the elastic anisotropy of the polymer.
