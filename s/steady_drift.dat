He was succeeded by Trajan in 98, who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic, by, for example, allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities. Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor. By far, his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus, which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices, and a corresponding order of promotion. Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius, who made no real changes to the constitution. Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161. The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality, as he made his brother, L. Aelius, his co-emperor. In 169, Aelius died, and in 176, Marcus Aurelius made his son, L. Aurelius Commodus, his new co-emperor. In 180, Marcus Aurelius died, and Commodus became Emperor. Commodus' tyranny revived the worst memories of the later Julian emperors, as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally have, and in disregarding the constitution. He was killed in 192.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{numerical}} investigation of droplets walking on a rotating vibrating fluid bath. The drop's trajectory is described by an integro-differential equation, which is simulated numerically in various parameter regimes. As the forcing acceleration is progressively increased, stable circular orbits give way to wobbling orbits, which are succeeded in turn by instabilities of the orbital center characterized by <b>steady</b> <b>drifting</b> then discrete leaping. In the limit of large vibrational forcing, the walker's trajectory becomes chaotic, but its statistical behavior reflects the influence of the unstable orbital solutions. The study results in a complete regime diagram that summarizes the dependence of the walker's behavior on the system parameters.

60|$|This discontent, this resentment, this {{contempt}} even, {{and hostility}} to duly elected representatives is no mere accident of this democratic country or that; {{it is an}} almost world-wide movement. It is an almost universal disappointment with so-called popular government, and in many communities--in Great Britain particularly--it is manifesting itself by an unprecedented lawlessness in political matters, and in a strange and ominous contempt for the law. One sees it, for example, in the refusal of large sections of the medical profession to carry out insurance legislation, in the repudiation of Irish Home Rule by Ulster, and in the <b>steady</b> <b>drift</b> of great masses of industrial workers towards the conception of a universal strike. The case of the discontented workers in Great Britain and France is particularly remarkable. These people form effective voting majorities in many constituencies; they send alleged Socialist and Labour representatives into the legislative assembly; and, in addition, they have their trade unions with staffs of elected officials, elected ostensibly to state their case and promote their interests. Yet nothing is now more evident than that these officials, working-men representatives and the like, do not speak for their supporters, and are less and less able to control them.

30|$|A {{wind farm}} may consist of {{hundreds}} or {{even thousands of}} DFIGs. Sometimes many wind farms dispersed {{in a wide range}} are integrated into a large-scale interconnected power system. In this situation, each wind farm can be described with an equivalent DFIG. The total wind generation may be regarded as a virtual wind plant which composes many equivalent DFIGs. Wind speed and directions differ one from another and the wind farm cannot be analyzed with detailed models because of the well-known ‘dimension catastrophe’ problem. The equivalent model is an effective method for reducing system order. However, the equivalent model is usually calculated at a specific steady state. The environmental scenario of wind farms keeps changing, and the <b>steady</b> state <b>drifts</b> due to the unpredictability of wind. Therefore, the equivalent model based on the operation point is stochastic; both structures and parameters of the equivalent model are random.

40|$|Abstract. Sommerfeld paradox roughly {{says that}} mathematically Couette linear shear is linearly stable for all Reynolds number, but {{experimentally}} arbitrarily small perturbations can induce {{the transition from}} the linear shear to turbulence when the Reynolds number is large enough. The main idea of our resolution of this paradox is to show that there is a sequence of linearly unstable shears which approaches the linear shear in the kinetic energy norm but not in the enstrophy (vorticity) norm. These oscillatory shears are single Fourier modes in the Fourier series of all the shears. In experiments, such linear instabilities will manifest themselves as transient nonlinear growth leading to {{the transition from the}} linear shear to turbulence no matter how small the intitial perturbations to the linear shear are. Under the Euler dynamics, these oscillatory shears are steady, and cat’s eye structures bifurcate from them as travelling waves. The 3 D shears U(y, z) in a neighborhood of these oscillatory shears are linearly unstable too. Under the Navier-Stokes dynamics, these oscillatory shears are not <b>steady</b> rather <b>drifting</b> slowly. When these oscillator...|$|R

40|$|A {{perturbation}} analysis {{based on}} {{equations of motion}} in Lagrangian form is presented for the oscillatory and mean motions induced by a forced periodic wave propagating in {{a thin layer of}} viscoelastic material. The material is assumed to be a Voigt body, for which the constitutive relation is a linear combination of viscous and elastic parts. In this work, the elastic part of the stress is assumed to be a linear function of the Lagrangian deformation tensor. The aim is to show a proper approach of carrying out the analysis to the second order {{in order to determine the}} mean deformation undergone by the material. This approach is in sharp contrast to the previous studies, which have mistakenly applied the complex viscoelastic parameter to the second order and assumed the mean motion to be a <b>steady</b> Lagrangian <b>drift.</b> It is shown here that for a sufficiently soft and viscous material the mean motion is actually a creeping motion that slowly dies out as a limit of finite deformation is approached.

This paper reports an attempt to perform such a comparison using the jet in the quasar 3 C 380. Observations made with the VSOP antenna HALCA together with a ground array at wavelength 1. 6 GHz provide total intensity and polarization images of comparable resolution to those from the ground array alone at 5 GHz.
