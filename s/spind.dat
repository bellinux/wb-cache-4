Due to coherent evidence 1 that, asymptotically, a zero energy state of a SU(N) -invariant supersymmetric matrix model in d = 3, 5 or 9 dimensions factorizes into a part involving only the Cartan subalgebra degrees of freedom (with effectively free dynamics) and a part forming supersymmetric harmonic oscillators, the following “wishful conjecture ” appeared: CW: For each N ≥ 2, and d = 9, the free Laplacian (times the unit operator in a 2 (N− 1) (d− 1) -dimensional Fock space) admits exactly one <b>Spin(d)</b> × SN invariant wavefunction (where SN denotes the permutation group of N letters) which is square integrable at ∞ and harmonic everywhere except at the origin, –whereas for d = 5 and 3 no such function exists. If true, CW would provide further evidence for the global existence of a unique (normalizable) zero energy state for d = 9, and (assuming effectively free dynamics for the Cartan subalgebra part) prove the nonexistence of a global zero energy state for d = 3 and 5. For N = 2, the d = 9 part of CW is implied by [4], [5], while the nonexistence for d = 3 and 5 was proven in [6], [3].

In an attempt to extend our knowledge about the asymptotic form of zeroenergy wave functions of SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix models beyond N = 2, it was recently shown [1], for N = 3, how to construct Weyl ⊗ <b>Spin(d)</b> invariant asymptotic states out of the Cartan-subalgebra degrees of freedom.

Should the answer really be that for arbitrary N, already for this “free ” problem, exactly one supersymmetric state exists for d = 9 (and none for d = 2, 3, 5), this should obviously have a “simple ” (deep?) mathematical explanation, of more general relevance.

Generalized Geometry allows us in addition to express the equations of motion explicitly in terms of fluxes.

Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation in the time gauge which yields a <b>Spin(D)</b> theory, a major challenge is to extend the internal gauge group to Spin(D+ 1) in presence of the Rarita-Schwinger field. This is non trivial because SUSY typically requires the Rarita-Schwinger field to be a Majorana fermion for the Lorentzian Clifford algebra and Majorana representations of the Clifford algebra are not available in the same spacetime dimension for both Lorentzian and Euclidean signature.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{background}} independent membrane field theories are studied, and several properties are discovered which {{suggest that they}} {{may play a role}} in a background independent form of M theory. The bulk kinematics of these theories are described in terms of the conformal blocks of an algebra G on all oriented, finite genus, two-surfaces. The bulk dynamics is described in terms of causal histories in which time evolution is specified by giving amplitudes to certain local changes of the states. Holographic observables are defined which live in finite dimensional states spaces associated with boundaries in spacetime. We show here that the natural observables in these boundary state spaces are, when G is chosen to be <b>Spin(D)</b> or a supersymmetric extension of it, generalizations of matrix model coordinates in D dimensions. In certain cases the bulk dynamics can be chosen so the matrix model dynamics is recoverd for the boundary observables. The bosonic and supersymmetric cases in D= 3 and D= 9 are studied, and it is shown that the latter is, in a certain limit, related to the matrix model formulation of M theory.
