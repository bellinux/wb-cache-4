40|$|High- and low-latitude forcing of {{terrestrial}} African paleoclimate variability is demonstrated using 900 ka eolian and biogenic component records from Ocean Drilling Program site 663 {{in the eastern}} equatorial Atlantic. Terrigenous (eolian dust) and phytolith (<b>savannah</b> <b>grass</b> cuticle) accumulation rate records vary predominantly at 100 and 41 kyr periodicities and spectral phase estimates implicate high-latitude forcing. The abundance of freshwater diatoms (Melosira) transported from dry African lake beds varies coherently at 23 - 19 kyr orbital periodicities and at a phasing which implicates low-latitude precessional monsoon forcing. Modeling studies demonstrate that African climate is sensitive to both high- and low-latitude boundary conditions. African monsoon intensity is modulated by direct insolation variations due to orbital precession, whereas remote high-latitude forcing {{can be related to}} cool North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) which promote African aridity and enhance dust-transporting wind speeds. The site 663 terrigenous and phytolith records covary with North Atlantic SST variability at 41 °N (site 607). We suggest that Pleistocene African climate has responded to both high-latitude North Atlantic SST variability as well as low-latitude precessional monsoon forcing; the high-latitude influence dominates the sedimentary record. Prior to circa 2. 4 Ma, terrigenous variations occurred primarily at precessional periodicities (23 - 19 kyr), indicating that African climate was largely controlled by low-latitude insolation variations prior to the onset of high-amplitude glacial-interglacial climate change...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} play a {{key role}} in climate change, and have adverse effects on human health. Given South Africa�s status as a rapidly-developing country with increasing urbanisation and industrial growth, information on the quality of ambient air is important. In this study, the chemical composition of ambient particles and the particles in fresh biomass burning plumes were studied at a savannah environment in Botsalano, South Africa. The results showed that Botsalano was regularly affected by air masses that had passed over several large point sources. Air masses that had passed over the coal-fired Matimba power station in the Waterberg, or over the platinum group metal smelters in the western Bushveld Igneous Complex, contained high sulfate concentrations in the submicron ranges. These concentrations were 14 to 37 times higher compared with air masses that had passed only over rural areas. Because of the limited nature of this type of data in literature for the interior regions of southern Africa, our report serves as a valuable reference for future studies. In addition, our biomass burning study showed that potassium in the fresh smoke of burning <b>savannah</b> <b>grass</b> was likely to take the form of KCl. Clear differences were found in the ratios for potassium and levoglucosan in the smouldering and flaming phases. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive chamber experiments on various fuel types used in southern Africa, to confirm the ratio of important biomass burning tracer species that can be used in source apportionment studies in the future...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen rapid {{intensification}} of cattle production in semi-arid savannah ecosystems, increasingly on formalized ranch blocks. As a result, vegetation community changes have occurred, notably bush encroachment (increased bush dominance) in intensively grazed areas. The exact causes of this vegetation change remain widely debated. Previous studies have suggested: (i) increased leaching {{of water and}} nutrients into the subsoil in intensively grazed areas provides deeper rooting bush species with a competitive advantage for soil water and nutrients, and (ii) nutrient leaching may be exacerbated by nutrient inputs from cattle dung and urine. Our research in the Eastern Kalahari showed that in infertile sandy soils both the magnitude of soil water and concentration of soil nutrients leached into the subsoil is largely unaffected by the ecological and biochemical effects of increased cattle use. We found that despite the high soil hydraulic conductivity (&greaterno; 12 cm h− 1), relatively high subsoil moisture contents and the restriction of water movement to matrix flow pathways prevent leaching losses beyond the rooting zone of <b>savannah</b> <b>grass</b> species. No significant differences in patterns of soil water redistribution were noted between bush dominant and grass dominant sites. We {{also found that the}} low nutrient status of Kalahari soils and leachate movement as matrix flow combine to allow nutrient adsorption on to soil particles. Nutrient adsorption ensures that nitrogen and phosphorus cycling remains topsoil dominated even following the removal of vegetation and direct nutrient inputs in cattle dung and urine. This conclusion refutes environmental change models that portray increases in the leaching of soil water and available nitrogen as a major factor causing bush encroachment. This provides a possible explanation for the now widely cited, but hitherto unexplained, resilience of dryland soils. We suggest that infertile sandy soils appear resilient to changes in soil water distribution and nutrient availability caused by increased cattle use. Hence, soil characteristics contribute to the resilience to permanent ecological change that is increasingly recognized as an attribute of semi-arid rangelands...|$|E

Overall, supervised pixel-based classification methods are found to be more reliable, accurate and outperformed unsupervised pixel-based classification methods in this study. The higher accuracy was attributed to the fact that supervised classification took advantage of spectral information of land cover, based on the spectral signature defined in the training set and digital image classification software that determines each class on what it resembles most in the training set in the remotely sensed imagery.

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of the Chaco {{varies from}} the east to the west, reflecting {{the changing nature of}} the soil. Eastern Chaco is noted for its park-like landscape of clustered trees and shrubs interspersed with tall, herbaceous savannahs. To the west, a wide transition zone grades into the espinal, a dry forest of spiny, thorny shrubs and low trees. Chaco's vegetation has adapted to grow in arid conditions, and is highly varied and exceedingly complex. One of the most impressive vegetation formations is called the quebrachales, which consists of vast, low hardwood forests where various species of quebracho trees are dominant. The quebracho tree is economically important as a source of tannin and lumber. These forests cover extensive areas away from the rivers; nearer the rivers they occupy the higher, better-drained sites, giving rise to a landscape in which the forests appear as islands amid a sea of <b>savannah</b> <b>grasses</b> growing as high as a person on horseback. In the more arid western Chaco, thorn forests, the continuity of which is occasionally broken by palm groves, saline steppes, and savannas, created by fire or deforestation, are dominated by another quebracho tree that has a lower tannin content and is used most often for lumber. There is also a marked increase in the number and density of thorny species, among which the notorious vinal (Prosopis ruscifolia) was declared a national plague in Argentina because of how its thorns, up to a foot in length, posed a livestock hazard in the agricultural lands it invaded.|$|R

It takes three or four months for the animal to adapt. Mortality can be high during this period, but this is less and less of a problem now that more young animals are being bred in captivity. Grasscutters can be kept either in individual cages, which increase production costs but prevents growth checks, or in enclosures built on the ground itself Optimum conditions should be Peaceful. cool, airy, light and clean. Four adult animals (one male to three females) require a surface area of two square metres. Otherwise, the only necessary provision is some bedding made of dry grass, a hollow tree trunk laid horizontally for shelter and a simple fodder rack. Grasscutters are herbivorous, living on green or dry fodder grass, seeds, rhizomes, tubers and a mineral mix made up of bonemeal, fishmeal, salt etc. Scrupulous attention to their hygiene (frequent cleaning, ventilation' etc.) will prevent disease in animals which are already acclimatized to captivity. Females reach breeding age at around six or seven months. and give birth to two to seven young after a gestation period of five months. There is an interval of about 13 or 14 months between litters.
