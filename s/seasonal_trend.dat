It {{is more common}} during times of confinement - winter and spring. In the spring, the level of infection increases rapidly as brood-rearing starts and while flight possibilities are still limited. Colonies in northern climates are more seriously affected than colonies in the south because of the increased amount of time bees are confined in the hive. Nosema, if left untreated, can cause queen supersedure, winter kills, reduced honey yields, and dwindling populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{molluscan}} macrofauna {{living in}} shallow muddy bottoms {{with the green}} algae Caulerpa prolifera was studied monthly between February 1994 and January 1996 in the inner Bay of Ca´ diz (SW Spain). The molluscan assemblage followed a similar pattern over the 2 years, displaying <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends</b> in species richness, abundance and structure. During the autumn and winter months, a decrease in abundance, species richness and diversity {{and an increase in}} evenness occurred. During the spring and summer months, the molluscan assemblage was characterised by an increase in species richness, abundance and diversity. These <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends</b> were supported statistically by the presence of significantly different groupings of seasonal samples in multivariate analyses. Despite human impacts in the bay (e. g. aquaculture activities, sewage), the presence of repetitive <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends,</b> based on the qualitative and quantitative data, indicates the stability of the molluscan assemblage over 2 years.

The objectives of this study were to assess if a <b>seasonal</b> <b>trend</b> in thermophilic Campylobacter spp. contamination of raw milk exists and to evaluate a possible relation between this and the increase of human campylobacteriosis incidence in summer months. The results showed a mean prevalence of 1. 6 % of milk samples positive for thermophilic Campylobacter spp. with a wide range (0. 0 - 3. 1 %) in different months during the three years considered.

From Taxus and Juniperus the wood was investigated in the same manner. Furtheron, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends</b> in total N-contents of leaves and barks of Taxus, Juniperus and Thuja were measured. As energy storing substances the N-compounds are not important. From the <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends</b> of the N-contents a function of the old leaves as an important N-storage pool for the budding may by concluded. In the one year old needles of Picea and Taxus the carbonic acid contents were measured, from an energetic point of view the acids are not important as reserve-substances. From the <b>seasonal</b> <b>trends</b> of the energy contents in the different species a general pattern of storage in gymnosperms growing under mild climatic conditions in Central Europe was deduced. Remarkably, according to this pattern the highest amounts of starch are found in the spring or early summer, the maximum contents of total lipide are reached during autumn or early winter and the highest contents of soluble sugars are found in the winter. This pattern confirms earlier assumptions regarding the functions of different storage substances. The total energy contents decline during the growth period and reach their lowest values in the late spring and early summer. In the winter none of the species showed an extensive diminution of storage energy, but rather sometimes a rise was seen which points to a net production during the winter months. Thus, the highest energy contents in the leaves are often found in the winter. The old needles have an important function as storage sites in the evergreen gymnosperms...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in the Netherlands shows a <b>seasonal</b> <b>trend,</b> with a peak {{in spring and}} a trough in autumn. Possible causes of this peak are winter crowding and a seasonal decrease in immune competence in spring. A third explanation may be a reporting bias. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of winter crowding by a time-series analysis of notification data. DNA fingerprinting clustering status can differentiate between recent and remote infections. Seasonality in clustered cases would reflect enhanced transmission in winter and/or seasonally lowered immunity, while seasonality in unique cases would only reflect seasonally lowered immunity. METHODS: We fitted (seasonal) auto-regressive moving average models to culture-positive TB notifications in the Netherlands (1993 – 2008) to assess seasonality. We then used <b>seasonal</b> <b>trend</b> Loess decompositions to derive the seasonal pattern, and compared the heights of the seasonal peaks. RESULTS: Clustered and unique EPTB notifications showed a <b>seasonal</b> <b>trend</b> that was absent in clustered and unique PTB notifications. The seasonal peak in clustered EPTB cases was not significantly higher than in unique EPTB cases. CONCLUSIONS: The similar timing and height of the seasonal peak of clustered and unique EPTB cases suggests that winter crowding is unlikely to cause the <b>seasonal</b> <b>trend</b> in notifications...|$|E

Consistent seasonal variations in viral infections were observed only with RSV (March-August) and influenza A virus (peaks in June, December-January).
