50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> hubs and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional four-wheel drive was still available with manual locking hubs.|$|E

Materials and methods Twenty-two patients suffering from atrophic diaphyseal long bone non-unions were enrolled in the study. Patients were treated with removal of pre-existing ardware, decortication of non-union fragments, and fixation of pseudoarthrosis with expandable intramedullary nailing (FixionTM, Disc’O Tech, Tel Aviv, Israel). At surgery, PRP was placed in the pseudoarthrosis rim. Results The thirteen-month follow-up showed 91 % (20 / 22 patients) of patients attaining bony union. The average time to union was 21. 5 weeks. No infection, neurovascular complication, rotational malalignment, or limb shortening [4 mm were observed. The healing rate of non-unions was comparable to that observed in previous studies but with a lower complication frequency.

30|$|Intramedullary nailing is {{considered}} the gold standard {{in the treatment of}} long bone non-unions of the lower limb [3]. To the best of our knowledge, only one study reported results of Fixion nail in the treatment of long bone non-unions [13]. In the present paper combined treatment of long bone non-unions by expandable <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> nails and PRP gel is evaluated. The rate of healed non-unions and the mean time to union were similar to those reported in previous studies carried out with different nails and without PRP gel [14 – 16]. Kempf et al., using their nail, noted 92.6 % and 94.8 % of consolidation in femoral and tibial non-unions, respectively [17]. The average time to consolidation was shorter than that obtained in our series but a 7.5 % infection rate and significant shortening of femur and tibia were reported [17]. The absence of interlocking screws with the related skin incisions and the short operative time could explain the lack of infection observed with expandable <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> nails. Moreover, the maintenance of limb length found in the present study could lie on the biomechanical characteristics of nail. Indeed, once the Fixion nail has expanded, it completely obliterates the medullary canal adapting to the canal’s shape [18]. The nail fits into the isthmus of the shaft and therefore any axial and sideways displacement is prevented [19]. The large frictional contact surface between nail and bone results in a self-locking effect without the cortex weakening effect of drill holes. Forces acting {{on the outside of the}} bone are distributed over a large area and are not concentrated on small, localized areas, as when locking screws are used [20]. Mechanical testing of humeral Fixion nail showed an average strength in the 4 -point-bending test of 43.15  ±  3.0  Nm and an average torsional stiffness of 2.78  ±  0.27  Nm 2 [20], thus overcoming the results recorded for several conventional locking nails [20]. The lack of interlocking screws allowed short operative and fluoroscopy times; fluoroscopy was mainly used throughout the expansion phase, because of the concern to over expand the medullary canal. Daccarett et al., using the Fixion nail, obtained a 96 % rate of healing with short time to consolidation (13, 15, and 16  weeks treating pseudoarthrosis of femur, tibia, and humerus, respectively). However, a more heterogeneous group of patients was enrolled in this study consisting of both hypertrophic and atrophic non-unions [13].|$|E
40|$|Coupling {{worm gears}} in large machine tool {{manipulator}} units (axes) {{can lead to}} overload damages under some operating conditions, like asymmetrical driving and emergency stop. This behaviour {{is caused by the}} <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> characteristic of worm gears with small pitch. If operated in the direction opposite to the designated one, self-locking can occur in the gears, subjecting the gears to an arbitrary torque which can be destructive. This condition can occur without counter torque on the driving side. In most gears, tooth engagement is based on a rolling motion. The slip component increases with a growing axis angle between the paired gears. In case of worm gears, the axis angle is 90 _, and therefore the coupling is purely frictious. This friction coupling is important in modelling. Especially the transition between the static and dynamic friction, where the system parameters change abruptly by a factor of two, should not be neglected. Based on the evaluated model a synchronous controller has been developed. This controller gives the oppertunity to drive swiveling axes with coupled selflocking gears by a standard gantry topology with an overlayed state changing master-slave topolog...|$|E

With the developed tactic, the total output power at 1. 06 μm for balanc-ing two-color intensities reaches 2. 9 W. Moreover, suppressing the excitation of a few high-order transverse modes enables a fairly stable picosecond pulse train to be achieved with the <b>self</b> mode <b>locking,</b> where the mode-locked pulse width and repetition rate are measured to be 47 ps and 2. 86 GHz, respectively.

40|$|Steering {{feel and}} vehicle {{steering}} motion {{is affected by}} wheel torques from propulsion, especially for front wheel drive cars. Often these problems {{are referred to as}} “torque steer”. Many systems interact to cause these problems: propulsion, steering and suspension. Torque steer contributors are not only the differential (friction, <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> effect, Torsen differential), but also the input from the ground and car geometry such as road conditions (friction and surface), the vehicle state (cornering, rolling, acceleration) and weight distribution (loading). In addition, the suspension design contributes as well, like the suspension geometry (kingpin offset, camber, caster, tolerances), the tire quality (conicity, wear, profile) and wheel geometry (size, uniformity, wheel offset). Finally, regarding the transmission contributors, the engine (torque, alignment) and drive shafts (alignment, length, symmetry) are contributors as well. Particularly, within the propulsion system, it is partly the asymmetry in differential and drive-shafts that could cause torque steer. In fact, the friction of the gear meshing and bearings, and mainly the contact with the housing (carrier) during slippery and static conditions or the housing stiffness itself might be causes of this torque steer problem. Hence, the losses over the differential can explain the torque steer effect due to the torque difference between left and right driveshaft. This fact affects the behaviour of the vehicle. This is the reason why Volvo Cars Corporation (VCC) is interested in studying the friction in a differential to use it in further simulations (vehicle dynamics purposes) or understand which parts of the design may be modified or changed in order to reduce or increase (depending on the goal, either getting as close as possible an open or a limited slip differential behaviour) the overall friction. The motivation of the thesis work comes from this problem. The thesis derives a model for an open differential in order to qualify and quantify the difference of torque between left and right side. In addition, to be able to test the differential, a rig is designed and machined outhouse. Moreover, during testing the model is updated and the parameters are changed according to the statistic experiment plan and the results from the FEM analysis carried out. Finally, not only all the conclusions and results are written down, but also some vehicle dynamics simulations to show the effect of the differential in the behaviour of the car...|$|E
40|$|Preterm {{premature}} rupture {{of fetal}} membranes is a devastating complication of pregnancy with {{high risk of}} feto-maternal mortality and morbidity. Several {{attempts have been made}} to seal spontaneous and iatrogenic fetal membrane ruptures but none has made it to clinics. Persistent leakage of amniotic fluid following invasive surgical and diagnostic procedures jeopardize the benefit of suchlife saving interventions and draw the limits for the developing field of intrauterine fetal surgery. Efforts are directed to take action before the commencement of leakage of amniotic fluid rather than after the leakage in iatrogenic maneuver: one avenue of research focuses on prophylactic plugging of the fetoscopic lesion at the time of completion of the procedure, thus to increase the chance to prevent subsequent leakage of amniotic fluid. In order to design appropriate sealing strategies the knowledge of the mechanical and biological properties of intact and injured fetal membranes is indispensable. The objective of this thesis is on the one hand to develop regimen that allow the repair of fetal membranes by plugging membrane lesions with fetoscopical interventions. On the other hand, we concentrate on the description of biophysical parameters of the fetal membrane by establishing biomechanical test regimen. Towards a fetoscopic repair mechanism I have developed a method to decellularize amniotic membranes in order to produce a non-immunogenic material. These membranes proved to be stable enough for long term storage and for off-the-shelf use. In our animal trials using rabbit does, the material exhibited good handling properties as well as good sealing characteristics in absence of adverse biological effects. Although the plugs were at best marginally remodeled and populated with cells in these short term experiments in rabbits, the <b>self</b> <b>locking</b> features of the plugs and the predictably long term stability of the material might be a critically important for future clinical applications. Towards the mechanical characterization of the fetal membranes I have together with the group of Prof. Edoardo Mazza, Department for Mechanics, ETHZ worked on the establishment of a novel device, which allows the measurement of mechanical properties and the testing of membrane sealing regimen under near to physiological 4 conditions. I have compared measurements of mechanical properties using this new generation device, which employs equibiaxial stretching with measurements performed with uniaxial stretching. These initial results indicate that the materials parameters can only be correctly estimated using biaxial stretching regimen and might add to the understanding of elastic and plastic features of biological membranes. Collectively a thorough understanding of mechanical and biological properties and the design of materials platforms that can be adapted to the tissue requirements might only approach the complexity of this problem. Although much more research is needed, we think that our results on the membrane repair and the mechanical properties presented in this thesis are promising starting points towards the establishment of appropriate treatment regimen for PPROM of fetal membranes...|$|E

6000|$|For my own part, {{being of}} a superstitious nature, given readily to imagine {{alarming}} causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic hints from Lentulus, concluded {{that he held}} a number of entirely original poems, {{or at the very}} least a revolutionary treatise on poetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling all that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid in speaking of the poets when he was present. For what might not Lentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my ignorant impressions ridiculous? One cannot well be sure of the negative in such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to it; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of. But time wearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the philosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets; nay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his mouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt consciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all thinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own power of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I began to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line of Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in systematic construction. In this case I did not figure to myself the existence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great thinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds long before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new passion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously unwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive <b>selves,</b> until the <b>locks</b> are grey or scanty.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsKristan L. CorwinWe {{have made}} {{significant}} accomplishments {{in the development}} of portable frequency standard inside hollow optical fibers. Such standards will improve portable optical frequency references available to the telecommunications industry. Our approach relies on the development of a stabilized Cr:forsterite laser to generate the frequency comb in the near-IR region. This laser is <b>self</b> referenced and <b>locked</b> to a CW laser which in turn is stabilized to a sub-Doppler feature of a molecular transition. The molecular transition is realized using a hollow core fiber filled with acetylene gas. We finally measured the absolute frequency of these molecular transitions to characterize the references. In this thesis, the major ideas, techniques and experimental results for the development and absolute frequency measurement of the portable frequency references are presented. A prism-based Cr:forsterite frequency comb is stabilized. We have effectively used the prism modulation along with power modulation inside the cavity in order to actively stabilize the frequency comb. We have also studied the carrier-envelope-offset frequency (f 0) dynamics of the laser and its effect on laser stabilization. A reduction of f 0 linewidth from [similar to] 2 MHz to [similar to] 20 kHz has also been observed. Both our in-loop and out-of-loop measurements of the comb stability showed that the comb is stable within a part in 10 ^ 11 at 1 -s gate time and is currently limited by our reference signal. In order to develop this portable frequency standard, saturated absorption spectroscopy is performed on the acetylene v 1 +v 3 band near 1532 nm inside different kinds of hollow optical fibers. The observed linewidths are a factor 2 narrower in the 20 um fiber as compared to 10 um fiber, and vary from 20 - 40 MHz depending on pressure and power. The 70 um kagome fiber shows a further reduction in linewidth to less than 10 MHz. In order to seal the gas inside the hollow optical fiber, we have also developed a technique of splicing the hollow fiber to solid fiber in a standard commercial arc splicer, rather than the more expensive filament splicer, and achieved comparable splice loss. We locked a CW laser to the saturated absorption feature using a Frequency Modulation technique and then compared to an optical frequency comb. The stabilized frequency comb, providing a dense grid of reference frequencies in near-infrared region is used to characterize and measure the absolute frequency reference based on these hollow optical fibers...|$|R
