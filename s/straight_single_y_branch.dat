40|$|Optical add–drop {{multiplexers}} (OADMs) {{based on}} asymmetric <b>Y</b> <b>branches</b> and tilted gratings offer excellent-performance in wavelength-division multiplexed systems. To simplify waveguide fabrication, ion-exchange techniques {{appear to be}} an important option in photosensitive glasses. Optimum OADM performance depends on how accurately the waveguide fabrication process and tilted Bragg grating operation are understood and modeled. Results from fabrication and comprehensive modeling are compared for ion-exchange processes that use different angles of the tilted grating. The transmission and reflection spectra for the fabricated and simulated OADMs show excellent agreement. The OADM’s performance is evaluated in terms of the measured characteristics of the <b>Y</b> <b>branches</b> and tilted gratings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A novel triplexer chip {{based on}} an {{asymmetric}} <b>Y</b> <b>branch</b> waveguide and a multimode interference is presented in this paper. Using the novel triplexer chip, a 1310 nm channel is multiplexed and 1490 nm and 1550 nm channels are demultiplexed for FTTH using. The asymmetric <b>Y</b> <b>branch</b> waveguide is used to separate the 1310 nm channel from the 1490 nm and 1550 nm channels. Then the multimode interference is used to demultiplex the 1490 nm from 1550 nm channel. The simulated spectra show the bandwidths of three response wavelengths are 100 nm, 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively, which can meet the demand of ITU. 984 completely. The isolation for 1310 nm is more than 48 dB, and the isolation between 1490 nm and 1550 nm is more than 37 dB...|$|R

50|$|A simple {{example of}} guarded logic is as follows: if X is true, then Y, else Z can be {{expressed}} in dynamic logic as (X?;Y)∪(~X?;Z). This shows a guarded logical choice: if X holds, then X?;Y is equal to Y, and ~X?;Z is blocked, and a ∪block is also equal to Y. Hence, when X is true, the primary performer of the action can only take the <b>Y</b> <b>branch,</b> and when false the Z branch.|$|R
