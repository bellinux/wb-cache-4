5|$|Another {{strategic}} Croatian {{foreign policy}} {{goal for the}} 2000s was NATO membership. Croatia {{was included in the}} Partnership for Peace in 2000, invited to NATO membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009. Croatia {{became a member of the}} United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term, assuming presidency in December 2008. The country is preparing to join the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the UK is {{not part}} of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> and because Belgium and France are not part of the Common Travel Area, all Eurostar {{passengers}} must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the Schengen governments concerned (Belgium and France) have legal obligations to check the travel documents of those entering their respective countries (as well as those leaving, in the case of Belgium and France).|$|E
5|$|European Union {{citizens}} {{have the right}} to travel freely into Malta without completing any special formalities. The nationals of many countries are not required to hold visas to enter Malta, although many are in accordance with uniform European Union regulations. A full list of nationalities required to hold visas to enter Malta and the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> is published on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' web site.|$|E
50|$|Departure Hall 1 {{consists}} of Piers B and C, {{both of which}} are dedicated <b>Schengen</b> <b>areas</b> and shares D-pier with Departure hall 2. Pier B has 14 gates and Pier C has 21 gates.|$|R
50|$|The table below {{includes}} Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania (which {{apply the}} <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area's</b> visa list), but excludes states {{which do not}} allow any Annex II nationals to work during their visa-free stay, namely: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Portugal and Spain.|$|R
5000|$|The European Parliament {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} on 8 July 2010 calling on {{all member states}} to recognise Kosovo. [...] In October 2010, an envoy of the European Parliament suggested that lack of recognition by some countries {{would not be an}} obstacle to Kosovo joining the <b>Schengen</b> <b>area's</b> visa-free regime.|$|R
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of Svalbard, {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and {{is not part of}} the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> nor the European Economic Area.|$|E
5|$|While Malta cannot {{unilaterally}} {{drop the}} requirement for nations it makes agreements with to obtain visas to enter the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> through its border crossing points, it is permitted to offer visa discounts to certain nationalities. At present, Malta has 'visa facilitation agreements' with eight nations: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Macedonia, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Republic of Germany was a {{founding}} member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7 (formerly G8), the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.|$|E
50|$|European Union {{citizens}} of the <b>Schengen</b> Treaty <b>area</b> can enter the islands freely, while those from other regions need identification.|$|R
50|$|After {{joining the}} European Union on 1 July 2013, Croatia adopted the common Schengen design for {{passport}} stamps, even though Croatia {{is still not}} a member of the <b>Schengen</b> passport-free <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|The UK is {{a member}} of the European Union, but it has an opt-out from the <b>Schengen</b> border-free <b>area.</b> It {{operates}} its own visa policy and also maintains the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and even more so than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as they are already inside the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area).</b> Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} entail military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations {{and it was the first}} state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Juxtaposition of the Greek {{sovereign}} debt default, mass-exodus migration crisis within the <b>Schengen</b> free-movement <b>area,</b> deft geopolitical manoeuvring by a resurgent Russia, Brexit, and high-profile cases of corporate fraud have severely dented European Union's {{standing in the}} world and raised questions about Europe's ability to manage problems at home.|$|R
5000|$|... The European Commission asked Romania {{to accept}} 6,351 {{refugees}} under an EU quota scheme. The EurActiv reported that [...] "Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta {{said that his}} country will request admission to the EU's <b>Schengen</b> borderless <b>area</b> if mandatory quotas to accept refugees are decided by the Union".|$|R
50|$|The newly born {{countries}} {{were able to}} solve the difficulties via mutual negotiations, financial compensation and, finally, an international treaty covering the border modifications.People living or owning property in the border area, however, continued to experience practical problems until both new countries entered the <b>Schengen</b> Agreement <b>Area</b> in 2007, after which the borders became less significant.|$|R
5|$|Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on {{the banks}} of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of {{population}} density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a , characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{police also}} have the {{responsibility}} for prisoner transport during detention, including transport to and from court. The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, Europol, the Schengen Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a New Zealand {{citizen who}} has already spent up to 3 months {{in other parts of}} the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> can enter Hungary and remain there for up to a further 90 days visa-free. Following the stay in Hungary, if 3 months has already spent {{elsewhere}} in the <b>Schengen</b> <b>area,</b> he/she must then leave the <b>Schengen</b> <b>area</b> from Hungary and go directly to a country outside the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the United Kingdom is {{not part}} of the <b>Schengen</b> passport-free <b>area,</b> it still uses the Schengen Information System, a {{governmental}} database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allows the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of the Schengen agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.|$|R
50|$|Since 1996, these {{countries}} {{have been part of}} the larger EU directive <b>Schengen</b> Agreement <b>area,</b> comprising 30 countries in Europe. Border checkpoints have been removed within the Schengen zone and only a national ID card is required. Within the Nordic area any means of proving one's identity, e.g. a driving licence, is valid for Nordic citizens, because of the Nordic Passport Union.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{multiple}} forms of European continental regionalism, which takes the overall {{shape of a}} complex set of concentric circles, with a substructure of a core group within the EU based on the euro and <b>Schengen</b> <b>areas,</b> and several rings of neighbours outside, including the European Economic Area, the regions of the EU’s neighbourhood policy and finally some pan-European organisations. While all world regions have their own unique features, the European case offers some important lessons that should be of interest to other world regions. The first is {{what appears to be a}} relatively robust model for single market integration. The second consists of the lessons currently being learned on the hazards on monetary integration without adequate fiscal and political integration. The third lesson is another warning, over the difficulties of anticipating the political dynamics of integration processes once set in motion, often described in Europe as a ‘journey to an unknown destination’. The fourth consists of the EU’s current efforts to develop a comprehensive neighbourhood policy, which is encountering difficult issues of matching ambitious objectives with incentives of adequate weight. Nevertheless, the policy sees a landscape of positive and constructive relations between the EU and its neighbours, in marked contrast to some ugly conflictual or coercive features seen in the cases of other continental hegemons – the three BRIC states of China, India and Russia, but not the fourth one, Brazil...|$|R
25|$|While {{nominally}} {{part of the}} <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> Spain performs {{identity checks}} on all sea and air passengers leaving the enclaves for elsewhere in the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|During June 2011 Croatia {{began with}} {{implementation}} of the projects and reforms required to join the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> by 2015. By joining the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> border checks will be eliminated at the land border with Hungary and Slovenia, {{as well as at}} airports and ports for flights and ships to/from Schengen member states, thus facilitating the freer movement of persons between Croatia {{and the rest of the}} <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{visa policy}} of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> is set by the European Union and applies to the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> and to other EU member states without the opt-outs enjoyed by Ireland and the UK. If someone other than a European Union, European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss citizen wishes to enter the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area,</b> Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania they must have a visa or be a {{national}} of a visa-exempt country.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the station as it existed {{at the start of}} the twenty-first century, with its bay platforms and five through platforms, was regarded as being more of a hindrance than a help to train services within the <b>Schengen</b> Agreement <b>area's</b> open borders. Under the so-called ÖBB-Bahnhofsoffensive, a complete rebuild of the railway tracks and platforms was therefore made. The bay platforms were replaced with through platforms, and the three dingy platform access underpasses by a large shopping mall. The shopping mall extended under all of the railway lines, from Südtirolerplatz to the north right through to the station's rear or southern side.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} {{nominally}} {{divided into two}} terminals, located 250 m apart and linked by an internal pedestrian connection both airside and landside. In practice, however, the airside parts of the terminal buildings are not divided into Terminal 1 (the former domestic terminal) and Terminal 2 (the former international terminal) but to <b>Schengen</b> and non-Schengen <b>areas.</b> The terminal capacity of the airport is approximately 16-17 million passengers per year.|$|R
50|$|The UK {{formally}} {{requested to}} participate in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis - Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation - in 1999, and this request {{was approved by the}} Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000. The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.Although the United Kingdom {{is not part of the}} <b>Schengen</b> passport-free <b>area,</b> it still uses the Schengen Information System, a governmental database used by European countries to store and disseminate information on individuals and property. This allows the UK to exchange information with countries that are a part of the Schengen agreement, often for the sake of liaising over law enforcement.|$|R
25|$|In December 1996 two non-EU member states, Norway and Iceland, {{signed an}} {{association}} {{agreement with the}} signatories of the Agreement {{to become part of}} the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area.</b> While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are not yet part of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Area</b> but, nonetheless, have a visa policy that is based on the Schengen acquis.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of EU rules on entry and residence on {{the territory of}} Member States. These rules are described {{from the perspective of}} different groups of people, EU citizens, citizens of EFTA Member States, family members or citizens of Turkey, and also from the perspective of Member States participating in the <b>Schengen</b> Border <b>Area</b> and Member States outside this Area. The core of this thesis consist is the analysis of four key EU rules in this field, namely the Border Code (Regulation 562 / 2002), the Visa Code (Regulation 810 / 2009), the 539 / 2001 Regulation and the 2004 / 38 Directive, as well as relevant case law of the Court of Justice, that influences the interpretation of the rules in hand significantly. The rules are also assessed {{from the point of view}} of principles of legal certainty and legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|Today the Balkans {{represent}} the only emigration area of Mediterranean Europe. The tight {{link between the}} Balkans and the European <b>Schengen</b> check-free <b>area</b> have certainly affected migration dynamics {{in the last years}} by favouring some flows and slowing down some others. The fluctuations of the process of enlargement and the emergence of new priorities are changing the enlargement roadmap. Some authors argue that the crisis is relegating the region to the outermost circle in a multi-speed Europe – the periphery of the periphery. The aim of the article is to analyse recent migration dynamics from the Balkans towards Europe to evaluate how this process was affected by EU policies and how Balkan migrants were integrated in the labour markets of destination countries. The EU enlargement process deeply affected migration trends in the area during the years 2000 s and in the last years a reduction of inflows directly proportional to the effect of the economic crisis on national production systems took place...|$|R
50|$|Schiphol uses a one-terminal concept, {{where all}} {{facilities}} are located {{under a single}} roof, radiating from the central plaza. The terminal, though, {{is divided into three}} sections or halls designated 1, 2 and 3. All of these halls, piers or concourses are connected. However, it is possible, on both sides of security or border inspection, to walk from between piers, even those connected to different halls. The exception to this is the low-cost pier M: once airside (past security), passengers cannot access any other areas. Border control separates <b>Schengen</b> from non-Schengen <b>areas.</b> Schiphol Airport has approximately 165 boarding gates.|$|R
