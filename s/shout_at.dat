5|$|Some time in July, {{probably}} just before Climbié {{was admitted to}} the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> Climbié all the time and never showed her affection.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E

In 1999, he was also given a column on new cars in the magazine GQ. His behaviour regularly annoyed his editors; those at GQ were frustrated by {{the large number of}} parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars for them, while he was consistently late in providing his columns for The Telegraph and The Spectator, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; they related that if they went ahead and published without his work included, he would get angry and <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> them with expletives.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2002, {{a set of}} five stamps commemorating films shot in Malta was {{scheduled}} to be issued.

25|$|In 1981, Sixx founded Mötley Crüe with drummer Tommy Lee. They {{were later}} joined by guitarist Mick Mars through {{an ad in}} the local newspaper, and singer Vince Neil, with whom Lee had {{attended}} high school. The band self-recorded their debut album, Too Fast for Love, which was subsequently released in November 1981 on the band's own Leathür Records label. After signing with Elektra Records they re-released the album. The band then went on to record and release <b>Shout</b> <b>at</b> the Devil, raising the band to national fame. They issued three more albums during the 80's, Theatre of Pain in 1985 and Girls, Girls, Girls in 1987, and Dr. Feelgood in September 1989. The latter ended up being their most successful record, staying in the charts for 114 weeks after its release.|$|E
25|$|With {{the series}} tied at 1–1 with two matches to go, New Zealand had a <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> gaining their first series win. That was quickly {{quenched}} – Cameron bowled 30 wicketless overs {{in the fourth}} Test at the Wanderers, and New Zealand's batting yielded twice as South Africa registered a win by an innings and 51 runs. Still, New Zealand drew the series, after Cameron took the final wicket. His match bowling figures then read 28.5–7–94–2, but with the final ball of the over he had South Africa's number 11 Harry Bromfield caught. Bromfield had been batting for the past half hour without scoring a run, {{though he had been}} in a partnership of 14 with 55 runs required for the win or 21 minutes required for the draw. Thus, Cameron finished his maiden Test series with 20 wickets at a bowling average of 24.65.|$|E
25|$|The band became rapidly {{successful}} in the United States after playing at the US Festival, and also {{with the aid of}} the new medium of MTV. They then gained the attention of heavy metal star Ozzy Osbourne and found themselves as the opening act for Osbourne on his 1984 world tour. The band members were well known for their backstage antics, outrageous clothing, extreme high-heeled boots, heavily applied make-up, and seemingly endless abuse of alcohol and drugs as well. As for their recordings, their mixture of heavy metal and hard rock stylings with influences by AC/DC and Aerosmith and guitar picking style of Judas Priest produced several best-selling albums during the 1980s, including <b>Shout</b> <b>at</b> the Devil (1983), Theatre of Pain (1985), and Girls, Girls, Girls (1987), which showcased their love of motorcycles, whiskey and strip clubs, and which told tales of substance abuse, sexual escapades, and general decadence.|$|E

500|$|... 1983 was the {{breakout}} {{year for}} glam metal: Quiet Riot's Metal Health {{was the first}} glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album, to reach {{number one in the}} Billboard charts. It helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent metal bands. Additionally, Night Ranger's second album in 1983 Midnight Madness was also a breakthrough that included the top five single [...] "Sister Christian". Also, in 1983, a larger wave of glam metal albums began appearing; Mötley Crüe released its second album <b>Shout</b> <b>at</b> the Devil, Def Leppard released its third album Pyromania, [...] 'Kix released its second album Cool Kids, Lita Ford released her initial album Out for Blood, and the band Kiss released its glam-sounding Lick It Up.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary Serbian sources, {{such as the}} hagiography of Saint Sava, {{are highly}} {{critical}} of Strez's actions. The Serbs accused Strez of recklessness, drunkenness, ungodliness, treason and cruelty. The hagiography of Saint Sava tells of Strez's alleged tendency to have captives thrown from a high cliff into the Vardar River for his and his guests' entertainment. As the prisoners were falling to their death, Strez would sarcastically <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> them not to get their coats wet. Bulgarian historian Ivan Lazarov dismisses these allegations as slanderous. In his biography of Strez, he hails the medieval ruler as a [...] "true member of the Asen dynasty" [...] and defends his actions due to him being a [...] "child of his time". Lazarov assesses Strez as a characteristic, vivid personality who put his independence above all.|$|E
500|$|The {{civil disobedience}} in 1930 {{marked the first}} time women became mass {{participants}} in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha. Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. Usha Mehta, an early Gandhian activist, remarked that [...] "Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> the top of their voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'" [...] The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a [...] "new and serious feature" [...] according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated [...] "thousands of them emerged....from the seclusion of their homes...in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant." ...|$|E

500|$|Often {{categorised}} {{with the}} new wave of British heavy metal, in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n' Dry, mixing glam-rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade. The follow-up Pyromania (1983), reached number two on the American charts and the singles [...] "Photograph", [...] "Rock of Ages" [...] and [...] "Foolin'", helped by the emergence of MTV, all reached the Top 40. It was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene. This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe, with their albums Too Fast for Love (1981) and <b>Shout</b> <b>at</b> the Devil (1983) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot. Quiet Riot's album Metal Health (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind, to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands.|$|E
500|$|Young Richard {{attended}} East Whittier Elementary School, {{where he}} was president of his eighth-grade class. His parents believed that attending Whittier High School had caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933), and so they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School. He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year, and he received excellent grades. Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week. He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, even though he was rarely used in games. He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, [...] "Remember, speaking is conversation... don't <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> people. Talk to them. Converse with them." [...] Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible.|$|E

[...] When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, [...] "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." [...] In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress. It remains unclear who has been involved in the recordings besides Avory and Ray Davies.|$|E

500|$|The borough has a {{place in}} several American idioms. The phrase [...] is meant to convey an {{extremely}} short time such as an instant, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in [...] "perhaps faster than you would believe is possible," [...] referring to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan. The expression [...] "melting pot" [...] was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908. The iconic Flatiron Building {{is said to have}} been the source of the phrase [...] "23 skidoo" [...] or scram, from what cops would <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building. The [...] "Big Apple" [...] dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City's horse racetracks and named his racing column [...] "Around The Big Apple." [...] Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.|$|E
500|$|According to Predić, the {{painting}} shows four intoxicated youths {{who have been}} drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge {{down the middle of}} the dirt road, keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The gajda (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son. She begins to <b>shout</b> <b>at</b> him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads Szeszfőzde ("distillery" [...] in Hungarian). Predić's initials in Cyrillic, У.П., can be found in the bottom-right corner.|$|E
