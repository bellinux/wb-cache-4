5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E
5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly {{the ones that were}} produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples. Many sutra copies contain a colophon with the name of the sponsor—often <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> the ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E

The villagers then blamed her for the disappearance, and she was dragged before the George pub and pelted with rotten fruit and stones, almost killing her. <b>Somebody</b> <b>from</b> Tom Heys' Farm then took the charm but, {{after a series of}} disasters — including milk not churning and animals not feeding — the charm was reluctantly exorcised by Reverend Baddeley.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy {{is the best way to}} make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E

500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

[...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E

[...] It was later reported that when <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> the crowd asked the Edmonson girls if they were ashamed for what they had done, Emily replied proudly that they would do exactly the same thing again.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this success, Tyler {{emerged as one of}} the most {{enduring}} rock icons. Since the late 1980s, he has embarked on several solo endeavors including guest appearances on other artists' music (working with artists as diverse as Alice Cooper, Mötley Crüe, Santana, Pink and Keith Anderson), film and TV roles (including as a judge on American Idol and several cameo and guest appearances in other programs and films), authoring a bestselling book and solo work (including the Top 40 hit single [...] "(It) Feels So Good" [...] in 2011). While tension with his Aerosmith bandmates boiled in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert, had a relapse with prescription drugs (which he successfully received treatment for in 2009), and signed on to American Idol without telling his bandmates, Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith, after more than 46 years in the band. In May 2015, Tyler released the country single [...] "Love Is Your Name", followed by the second single [...] "Red, White & You" [...] in January 2016; his debut solo album, We're All <b>Somebody</b> <b>from</b> Somewhere, was released on July 15, 2016.|$|E

[...] Kedarnath replied, [...] "Your teachings have been significantly [...] depreciated, and I lack the power to restore them. Much of my life has passed and I am otherwise engaged, so please send <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> Your personal staff so that I can start this movement". Jagannath then requested Kedarnath to pray for an assistant {{to the image of}} the Goddess Bimala Devi worshiped in the Jagannath temple. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad ('"the mercy of Bimala Devi").
