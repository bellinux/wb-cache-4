40|$|Abstract. Silicon wafer {{is widely}} used in {{semiconductor}} industries for development of sensors and integrated circuit in computer, cell phones and wide variety of other devices. Demand on the device performance requires flatter wafer surface, and less dimensional wafer variation. Prime silicon wafer is hard and brittle material. Due to its properties, double <b>sided</b> <b>lapping</b> machine with ceramic grinding agent were introduced for machining high quality standard silicon wafers. The main focus is the silicon wafer with high accuracy of flatness; to reduce total thickness variation, waviness and roughness. In this paper the lapping experiment and analysis showed that the double <b>sided</b> <b>lapping</b> machine is able to produce total thickness variation less than 10 um at controlled process parameters within short processing time. Machining using low mode method reduced the total thickness variation (TTV) value. The lapping load and speed directly reflected the performance and condition of final silicon wafer quality...|$|R

40|$|Z/I Imaging {{introduced}} {{with the}} DMC II 140, 230 and 250 digital aerial cameras {{with a very}} large format CCD for the panchromatic channel. The CCDs have with 140 / 230 / 250 mega pixel a size not available in photogrammetry before. CCDs in general {{have a very high}} relative accuracy, but the overall geometry has to be checked as well as the influence of not flat CCDs. A CCD with a size of 96 mm x 82 mm must have a flatness or knowledge of flatness in the range of 1 mu m if the camera accuracy in the range of 1. 3 mu m shall not be influenced. The DMC II cameras have been evaluated with three different flying heights leading to 5 cm, 9 cm and 15 cm or 20 cm GSD, crossing flight lines and 60 % <b>side</b> <b>lap.</b> The optimal test conditions guaranteed the precise determination of the object coordinates as well as the systematic image errors. All three camera types show only very small systematic image errors, ranging in the root mean square between 0. 12 mu m up to 0. 3 mu m with extreme values not exceeding 1. 6 mu m. The remaining systematic image errors, determined by analysis of the image residuals and not covered by the additional parameters, are negligible. A standard deviation of the object point heights below the GSD, determined at independent check points, even in blocks with just 20 % <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> and 60 % end lap is standard. Corresponding to the excellent image geometry the object point coordinates are only slightly influenced by the self calibration. For all DMCII types the handling of image models for data acquisition must not be supported by an improvement of the image coordinates by the determined systematic image errors. Such an improvement up to now is not standard for photogrammetric software packages. The advantage of a single monolithic CCD is obvious. An edge analysis of pan-sharpened DMC II 250 images resulted in factors for the effective resolution below 1. 0. The result below 1. 0 is only possible by contrast enhancement, but this requires with low image noise, demonstrating the very good radiometric image quality...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{semi-automatic}} building extraction {{together with a}} concept for storing building models alongside with terrain data in a topographical information system (TIS) is presented. A user interface based on Constructive Solid Geometry is combined with an internal data structure completely based on boundary representation. Each building can be de-composed into a set of simple primitives which are reconstructed individually. After selecting a primitive from a data base of common building shapes, the primitive parameters can be modified by interactive measurement in digital images {{in order to provide}} approximate values for automatic fine measurement. In all phases, the properties of the boundary models are directly connected to parameter estimation: the parameters of the building primitives are determined in a hybrid adjustment of camera co-ordinates and fictitious observations of points being situated on building faces. Automatic fine measurement is an application of a general framework for object surface reconstruction using hierarchical feature based object space matching. The integration of object space into the matching process is achieved by the new modelling technique. The management of both building and terrain data in a TIS is based on a unique principle. Meta data are managed in a relational data base, whereas the actual data are treated as binary large objects. The new method is evaluated in a test project (image scale: 1 : 4500, 70 % overlap, 50 % <b>side</b> <b>lap).</b> The automatic tool gives results with an accuracy of +- 2 - 5 cm in planimetric position and +- 5 - 10 cm in height. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for dense point cloud matching and aero triangulation {{based on the}} well-known scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique. The modern digital cameras can take high resolution aerial images with high end lap between contiguous images in a strip and, if needed, also with high <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> between images on neighboring strips. Therefore, automation on image matching for generation of high density of 3 D object points becomes applicable. A new method is thus developed to perform the processing. Moreover, it can do an aero triangulation and automatic tie point measurement without the need on the input data such as block and strip data for providing image overlap information. In order to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} method for simultaneously processing a large number of aerial images with large image format in a block area, both schemes of Quality Filtering (QF) and Affine Transformation Prediction (AFTP) are proposed for automatic tie point extraction and measurement with a better and satisfactory efficiency. Tests are done by using aerial images taken with the RMK DX camera in Taiwan. Also, high precision ground check points are adopted to evaluate the quality of the results. They show that a high density of 3 D object points are extracted and determined. Furthermore, the automatic tie point selection and measurement is done efficiently even under the circumstance that no priori-knowledge on image overlap is available. Also, ground check points show that the accuracy of photo coordinates is 0. 21 pixels, namely it reaches a subpixel level...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Lately {{the use of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for {{remote sensing}} has {{attracted}} attention from researchers. This {{can be attributed to}} its low cost and feasibility to automate flight commands along a set of waypoints. Moreover, UAVs has shown promise lately {{in a number of areas}} including monitoring vegetation and soil health, agriculture, forestry and land use. However, little is being done related to coastal management or aquatic monitoring. Most of the remote sensing researches attributed to coastal monitoring and management are usually satellite based or Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). UAVs can fly in place of piloted aircraft to gather remote sensing information on coastal area characteristics from mangroves to seagrass to corals. The type of sensors flown depends on the instrument’s weight limitation, so that, depending on the specification of the UAV, it is possible to acquire video, aerial photographs, multispectral and hyperspectral radiometric, LiDAR, and radar data etc. This study utilizes UAV with a small digital camera for medium scale coastal mapping. The first objective of this study is to investigate the use of lightweight first person view (FPV) raptor UAV for mapped image of coastal body with limited ground control points for generating orthophoto mosaic of the coastal area. Aerial photographs were acquired at an estimated of 60 % forward lap and 40 % <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> specifications. The second objective is to determine the accuracy of the photogrammetric output. It is expected that this survey will provide guidelines for future remote sensing project using low cost digital aerial images. Also the results from this study will serve as an input for further analysis to identify submerged aquatic vegetation like seagrass...|$|E
40|$|Digital Surface Models (DSM) {{generated}} with pixel-sharp Semi-Global Matching (SGM) in full {{image resolution}} {{are more and}} more accepted to set the worldwide standard for photogrammetric image matching. For many mapping and classification tasks the combination of a DSM and a True-Ortho Mosaic (TOM) is better suited than a traditional orthophoto since TOM and DSM are perfectly co-registered and geometrically more correct. Due {{to the fact that the}} combination of TOM and DSM has been established as standard for large scale aerials surveys in the last years, TOM and DSM {{are more and more}} used as input for the extraction of forest parameters on the stock- and individual tree level. The limits of the used methods are directly linked to the constraints of the used data source. For example understory in coniferous and deciduous forest cannot be extracted or trees with a branch tree trunk cannot be extracted as a single tree. The methods used for the extraction of single trees are the focal statistics analysis and the sink analysis for the detection of tree tops which are implemented in a GIS model. In order to extract the crowns of trees a region growing segmentation and basin analysis are used. In a previous study the achieved completeness was > 90 percent with a correctness > 85 percent for coniferous trees. The completeness in a deciduous forest came up to 87 percent with a correctness of the extracted trees close to 89 percent. In this paper the extraction accuracies for individual trees and the minimum requirements for an efficient single tree extraction from TOM and DSM are analyzed as function of the geometric properties of the sensor system (e. g. FOV, geometric and radiometric resolution), flight parameters (altitude, overlap along / across track) and the corresponding qualities of DSM and TOM. Aerial images from UltraCam, DMC and the DLR MACS systems with systematically varying flight parameters including those for standard aerial surveys (overlap 80 / 60, 80 / 40, 60 / 40) are used as data base. Depending on the forest structure the best geometric resolution for an efficient single tree extraction in the GIS model ranges from 30 to 50 cm. Further increase of the geometric resolution from 30 to 10 cm does not improve the extraction accuracies. However our analyses show that the flight parameters have a significant influence on the extraction accuracy. For example from a flight altitude of about 7000 meters a nominal geometric resolution of 50 cm from an UltraCamX System. Due to the high flight altitude strong atmospheric effects occur, which have a strong negative influence on the radiometry and image homogeneity and subsequently the image matching (DSM). Hence the classification and the extraction accuracy decrease. Therefore higher resolution aerial images between 20 and 30 cm or better are important as data base for DSM and TOM generation. For the GIS based single tree extraction further resampling of the DSM is often necessary. The second important flight parameter is the overlap along and across track. The overlap depends on the FOV of the camera systems as well as the method of image matching. For example due to FOV the recommended minimum strip <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> for a DSM generation with SGM and DMC 1 system is 40 percent. For an UltraCamX system 30 percent strip <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> are sufficient. If the minimum quality requirements to the flight parameters and the resulting TOM and DSM are met, the type of the used sensor system has a fairly low influence on the extraction accuracy because of the robustness of the extraction methods. Commercial camera systems as well as the DLR camera systems lead to comparable results. More detailed results of the ongoing study will be presented at the conference...|$|E

40|$|Efficient mapping from {{unmanned}} aerial platforms cannot rely on {{aerial triangulation}} using known ground control points. The cost {{and time of}} setting ground control, added {{to the need for}} increased overlap between flight lines, severely limits the ability of small VTOL platforms, in particular, to handle mapping-grade missions of all but the very smallest survey areas. Applanix has brought its experience in manned photogrammetry applications to this challenge, setting out the requirements for increasing the efficiency of mapping operations from small UAVs, using survey-grade GNSS-Inertial technology to accomplish direct georeferencing of the platform and/or the imaging payload. The Direct Mapping Solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (DMS-UAV) is a complete and ready-to-integrate OEM solution for Direct Georeferencing (DG) on unmanned aerial platforms. Designed as a solution for systems integrators to create mapping payloads for UAVs of all types and sizes, the DMS produces directly georeferenced products for any imaging payload (visual, LiDAR, infrared, multispectral imaging, even video). Additionally, DMS addresses the airframe’s requirements for high-accuracy position and orientation for such tasks as precision RTK landing and Precision Orientation for Air Data Systems (ADS), Guidance and Control. This paper presents results using a DMS comprised of an Applanix APX- 15 UAV with a Sony a 7 R camera to produce highly accurate orthorectified imagery without Ground Control Points on a Microdrones md 4 - 1000 platform conducted by Applanix and Avyon. APX- 15 UAV is a single-board, small-form-factor GNSS-Inertial system designed for use on small, lightweight platforms. The Sony a 7 R is a prosumer digital RGB camera sensor, with a 36 MP, 4. 9 -micron CCD producing images at 7360 columns by 4912 rows. It was configured with a 50 mm AF-S Nikkor f/ 1. 8 lens and subsequently with a 35 mm Zeiss Sonnar T* FE F 2. 8 lens. Both the camera/lens combinations and the APX- 15 were mounted to a Microdrones md 4 - 1000 quad-rotor VTOL UAV. The Sony A 7 R and each lens combination were focused and calibrated terrestrially using the Applanix camera calibration facility, and then integrated with the APX- 15 GNSS-Inertial system using a custom mount specifically designed for UAV applications. The mount is constructed {{in such a way as}} to maintain the stability of both the interior orientation and IMU boresight calibration over shock and vibration, thus turning the Sony A 7 R into a metric imaging solution. In July and August 2015, Applanix and Avyon carried out a series of test flights of this system. The goal of these test flights was to assess the performance of DMS APX- 15 direct georeferencing system under various scenarios. Furthermore, an examination of how DMS APX- 15 can be used to produce accurate map products without the use of ground control points and with reduced sidelap was also carried out. Reducing the <b>side</b> <b>lap</b> for survey missions performed by small UAVs can significantly increase the mapping productivity of these platforms. The area mapped during the first flight campaign was a 250 m x 300 m block and a 775 m long railway corridor in a rural setting in Ontario, Canada. The second area mapped was a 450 m long corridor over a dam known as Fryer Dam (over Richelieu River in Quebec, Canada). Several ground control points were distributed within both test areas. The flight over the block area included 8 North-South lines and 1 cross strip flown at 80 m AGL, resulting in a ~ 1 cm GSD. The flight over the railway corridor included 2 North-South lines also flown at 80 m AGL. Similarly, the flight over the dam corridor included 2 North-South lines flown at 50 m AGL. The focus of this paper was to analyse the results obtained from the two corridors. Test results from both areas were processed using Direct Georeferencing techniques, and then compared for accuracy against the known positions of ground control points in each test area. The GNSS-Inertial data collected by the APX- 15 was post-processed in Single Base mode, using a base station located in the project area via POSPac UAV. For the block and railway corridor, the basestation’s position was precisely determined by processing a 12 -hour session using the CSRS-PPP Post Processing service. Similarly, for the flight over Fryer Dam, the base-station’s position was also precisely determined by processing a 4 -hour session using the CSRS-PPP Post Processing service. POSPac UAV’s camera calibration and quality control (CalQC) module was used to refine the camera interior orientation parameters using an Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO) approach. POSPac UAV was also used to generate the Exterior Orientation parameters for images collected during the test flight. The Inpho photogrammetric software package was used to develop the final map products for both corridors under various scenarios. The imagery was first imported into an Inpho project, with updated focal length, principal point offsets and Exterior Orientation parameters. First, a Digital Terrain/Surface Model (DTM/DSM) was extracted from the stereo imagery, following which the raw images were orthorectified to produce an orthomosaic product...|$|E
