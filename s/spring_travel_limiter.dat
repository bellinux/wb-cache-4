50|$|The {{aircraft}} had stalled {{during an}} abnormally steep climb {{and had been}} unable to recover. On 1 December 2015, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee released its report concluding that the sequence of events leading to the crash started with a malfunction in the rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> unit. The pilots' response led to a 104-degree roll of the aircraft, and apparent miscommunication between them was a significant link in the chain of events that led to the loss of the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|After {{studying}} {{the wreckage of}} the Airbus A320-216 as well as the two black boxes and the cockpit recorder, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee issued a report with their conclusions from the investigation on 1 December 2015. The report stated that the sequence of events that led to the crash started with a malfunction in two of the plane’s rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> units (RTLU). A tiny soldered electrical connection in the plane's RTLU was found to be cracked, likely for over a year, causing it to intermittently send amber master caution warnings to the electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) - with the plane's maintenance records showing that the RTLU warning had been sent 23 times over the previous year, but was always solved (and never further investigated, which could have addressed the underlying electrical problem) by resetting the RTLU system. On this flight, the RTLU issue sent an amber caution warning four different times, and the first three times that the ECAM system gave the warning [...] "Auto Flight Rudder <b>Travel</b> <b>Limiter</b> System", the pilot in command followed the ECAM instructions, toggling the flight augmentation computer (FAC) 1 and 2 buttons on the cockpit's overhead panel to off and then on. This procedure did clear the amber master caution warnings for each of those first three warnings.|$|R

25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, {{but it is more}} important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter.</b> The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its blowdown limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|R

50|$|The report {{stated that}} the crash {{resulted}} from the flight crew’s inability to control the aircraft in alternate law. The cracking of a solder joint resulted in {{the failure of the}} Rudder <b>Travel</b> <b>Limiter</b> Unit four times during the flight. The flight crew action to the first three faults was in accordance with the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor messages. Following the fourth fault, the Flight Augmentation Computer's circuit breakers were reset by the flight crew, resulting in electrical interruption to the computers causing the autopilot to disengage and the flight control logic to change to Alternate Law. The rudder deflected 2 degrees to the left, causing the aircraft to roll up to 54 degrees. Subsequent flight crew actions resulted in the aircraft entering a prolonged stall from which they were unable to recover.|$|R

40|$|<b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> rush is a {{phenomenon}} in China that population travel intensively surges {{in a short time}} around Chinese Spring Festival. This phenomenon, which is a special one in the urbanization process of China, brings a large traffic burden and various kinds of social problems, thereby causing widespread public concern. This study investigates the spatial-temporal characteristics of <b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> rush in 2015 through time series analysis and complex network analysis based on multisource big travel data derived from Baidu, Tencent, and Qihoo. The main results are as follows: First, big travel data of Baidu and Tencent obtained from location-based services might be more accurate and scientific than that of Qihoo. Second, two travel peaks appeared at five days before and six days after the Spring Festival, respectively, and the travel valley appeared on the Spring Festival. The <b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> network at the provincial scale did not have small-world and scale-free characteristics. Instead, the travel network showed a multicenter characteristic and a significant geographic clustering characteristic. Moreover, some travel path chains played {{a leading role in the}} network. Third, economic and social factors had more influence on the travel network than geographical location factors. The problem of <b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> rush will not be effectively improved in a short time because of the unbalanced urban-rural development and the unbalanced regional development. However, the development of the modern high-speed transport system and the modern information and communication technology can alleviate problems brought by <b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> rush. We suggest that a unified real-time traffic platform for <b>Spring</b> Festival <b>travel</b> rush should be established through the government's integration of mobile big data and the official authority data of the transportation department...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Panhard rod is its simplicity. Its major disadvantage is that the axle must necessarily move in an arc relative to the body, with the radius equal {{to the length of}} the Panhard rod. If the rod is too short, it allows excessive sideways movement between the axle and the body at the ends of the <b>spring</b> <b>travel.</b> Therefore, the Panhard rod is less desirable on smaller cars than larger ones. A suspension design that is similar but dramatically reduces the sideways component of the axle's vertical travel is Watt's linkage.|$|R

40|$|The Chinese Spring Festival {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} traditional festivals in China. The peak transport in the Spring Festival season (<b>spring</b> <b>travel</b> rush) provides a unique opportunity for investigating the impact of human activities on air quality in the Chinese megacities as emission sources varied and fluctuated greatly prior to, during and after the festival. Enhanced vehicular emission during the <b>spring</b> <b>travel</b> rush before the festival resulted in high level pollutants of NO x (270 μg m − 3), CO (2572 μg m − 3), BC (8. 5 μg m − 3) and extremely low single scattering albedo of 0. 70, indicating strong fresh combustion. Organics contributed most to PM 2. 5, followed by NO 3 −, NH 4 +, and SO 4 2 −. During the Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve and Day, widespread usage of fireworks burning caused heavy pollution of extremely high aerosol mass concentration, scattering coefficient, SO 2 and NO x. Due to the <b>spring</b> <b>travel</b> rush after the festival, anthropogenic emission gradually climbed and mirrored corresponding increases in the aerosol components and gaseous pollutants. Secondary inorganic aerosol (SO 4 2 −, NO 3 −, and NH 4 +) accounted for a dominant fraction of 74 % in PM 2. 5 due to the enhanced human activities, e. g. higher demand of energy usage from returned residents and re-open of factories and construction sites, more vehicle mileages due to returned workers and expanded public transportation. The average visibility during whole study period was less than 6 km. It was estimated that about 50 % of the total light extinction was due to the high water vapor in the atmosphere. Of the aerosol extinction, organic aerosol had the largest contribution of 47 %, followed by sulfate ammonium, nitrate ammonium and EC of 22 %, 14 %, and 12 %, respectively. Our results indicated the dominant role of traffic-related aerosol species (i. e. organic aerosol, nitrate and EC) on the formation of air pollution, and suggested the importance of controlling vehicle numbers and emissions in mega-cities of China as its population and economy continue to grow...|$|R
