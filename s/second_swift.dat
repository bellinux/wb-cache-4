The [...] line, tentatively named [...] "Swift II", was created out of two Transit Emphasis Corridors, and would travel from the Boeing Everett Factory to Mill Creek via Airport Road and State Route 527. A study, prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, and partially funded by the state legislature in 2012, estimated that the project would cost $42–48 million to construct, and attract 3,300 riders when it opened. The Federal Transit Administration approved project development in December 2014, a prerequisite to federal grants for capital construction and vehicle acquisition. During the 2015 session of the Washington State Legislature, Community Transit was granted the authority to increase sales taxes to fund operation of Swift II, pending voter approval via a ballot measure; the Washington State Department of Transportation also gave $6.8 million in funding to build the line's northern terminus at Seaway Transit Center.

This prompted a two-lap sprint to the finish with Bird as the leader. Sarrazin took over third when Abt slowed with a battery management system failure on the final lap; Abt narrowly avoided collecting teammate di Grassi as he endeavoured to rejoin and stopped on track.

40|$|We {{present the}} <b>second</b> <b>Swift</b> Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) catalog of gamma-ray bursts. (GRBs), which {{contains}} 476 bursts detected by the BAT between 2004 December 19 and 2009 December 21. This catalog (hereafter the BAT 2 catalog) presents burst trigger time, location, 90 % error radius, duration, fluence, peak flux, time-averaged spectral parameters and time-resolved spectral parameters {{measured by the}} BAT. In the correlation study of various observed parameters extracted from the BAT prompt emission data, we distinguish among long-duration GRBs (L-GRBs), short-duration GRBs (S-GRBs), and short-duration GRBs with extended emission (S-GRBs with E. E.) to investigate differences in the prompt emission properties. The fraction of L-GRBs, S-GRBs and S-GRBs with E. E. in the catalog are 89 %, 8 % and 2 % respectively. We compare the BAT prompt emission properties with the BATSE, BeppoSAX and HETE- 2 GRB samples [...] We also correlate the observed prompt emission properties with the redshifts for the GRBs with known redshift.

40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{follow-up}} of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows {{made possible by}} the multiwavelength satellite Swift, launched in November 2004, has put under a microscope the GRB early post-burst behavior, This is leading to a significant reappraisal and expansion of the standard view of the GRB early afterglow behavior, and its connection to the prompt gamma-ray emission. In addition to opening up the previously poorly known behavior on minutes to hours timescales, two other new pieces in the GRB puzzle being filled in are the the discovery and {{follow-up of}} short GRB afterglows, and the opening up of the z> ∼ 6 redshift range. We review some of the current theoretical interpretations of these new phenomena. CHALLENGES POSED BY NEW SWIFT OBSERVATIONS Compared to previous satellites, Swift has made a large difference on two main accounts. First, the sensitivity of the Burst Alert Detector (BAT, in the range 20 - 150 keV) is a factor ∼ 5 higher than for the corresponding instruments in the predecessor CGRO-BATSE, BeppoSAX and HETE- 2. <b>Second,</b> <b>Swift</b> can slew in less then 100 seconds in the direction determined by the BAT instrument, positioning its much higher angula...|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discoveries of}} galaxies and gamma ray bursts (GRBs) at high redshift have supplied the first direct information on star formation {{when the universe}} was only a few hundred million years old. The probable origin of long duration GRBs in the deaths of massive stars would link the universal GRB rate to the redshift-dependent star formation rate (SFR) density, although exactly how is currently unknown. As the most distant GRBs and star-forming galaxies probe the reionization epoch, the potential reward of understanding the redshift-dependent ratio Ψ(z) of the GRB rate to SFR is significant and includes addressing fundamental questions such as incompleteness in rest-frame UV surveys for determining the SFR at high redshift and time variations in the stellar initial mass function. Using an extensive sample of 112 GRBs above a fixed luminosity limit drawn from the <b>Second</b> <b>Swift</b> Burst Alert Telescope catalog and accounting for uncertainty in their redshift distribution by considering the contribution of "dark" GRBs, we compare the cumulative redshift distribution N(4 measured from rest-frame optical surveys.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} {{for the detection}} of flares in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves and use this algorithm to detect flares in the UV/optical. The algorithm makes use of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to analyze the residuals of the fitted light curve, removing all major features, and to determine the statistically best fit to the data by iteratively adding additional `breaks' to the light curve. These additional breaks represent the individual components of the detected flares: T_start, T_stop, and T_peak. We present the detection of 119 unique flaring periods detected by applying this algorithm to light curves taken from the <b>Second</b> <b>Swift</b> Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) GRB Afterglow Catalog. We analyzed 201 UVOT GRB light curves and found episodes of flaring in 68 of the light curves. For those light curves with flares, we find an average number of ~ 2 flares per GRB. Flaring is generally restricted to the first 1000 seconds of the afterglow, but can be observed and detected beyond 10 ^ 5 seconds. More than 80 % of the flares detected are short in duration with Delta t/t of < 0. 5. Flares were observed with flux ratios relative to the underlying light curve of between 0. 04 to 55. 42. Many of the strongest flares were also seen at greater than 1000 seconds after the burst. Comment: Submitted to ApJ. 20 pages (including 8 figures and 1 table...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} <b>second</b> <b>Swift</b> Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{afterglow}} catalog, greatly expanding {{on the first}} Swift UVOT GRB afterglow catalog. The second catalog is constructed from a database containing over 120, 000 independent UVOT observations of 538 GRBs first detected by Swift, the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE 2), the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), the Interplanetary Network (IPN), Fermi, and Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE). The catalog covers GRBs discovered from 2005 Jan 17 to 2010 Dec 25. Using photometric information in three UV bands, three optical bands, and a `white' or open filter, the data are optimally co-added to maximize the number of detections and normalized to one band to provide a detailed light curve. The catalog provides positional, temporal, and photometric information for each burst, as well as Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) GRB parameters. Temporal slopes are provided for each UVOT filter. The temporal slope per filter of almost half the GRBs are fit with a single power-law, but one to three breaks are required in the remaining bursts. Morphological comparisons with the X-ray reveal that approximately 75 % of the UVOT light curves are similar {{to one of the}} four morphologies identified by Evans et al. (2009). The remaining approximately 25 % have a newly identified morphology. For many bursts, redshift and extinction corrected UV/optical spectral slopes are also provided at 2000, 20, 000, and 200, 000 seconds.

We compare the BAT prompt emission properties with the BATSE, BeppoSAX and HETE- 2 GRB samples. We also correlate the observed prompt emission properties with the redshifts for the GRBs with known redshift. The BAT T 90 and T 50 durations peak at 70 s and 30 s, respectively. We confirm that the spectra of the BAT S-GRBs are generally harder {{than those of the}} L-GRBs. The time-averaged spectra of the BAT S-GRBs with E. E. {{are similar to those of}} the L-GRBs. Whereas, the spectra of the initial short spikes of the S-GRBs with E. E. are similar to those of the S-GRBs. We show that the BAT GRB samples are significantly softer than the BATSE bright GRBs, and that the time-averaged Epeak of the BAT GRBs peaks at 80 keV which is significantly lower energy than those of the BATSE sample which peak at 320 keV. The time-averaged spectral properties of the BAT GRB sample are similar to those of the HETE- 2 GRB samples. By time-resolved spectral analysis, we find that only 10 % of the BAT observed photon indices are outside the allowed region of the synchrotron shock model.
