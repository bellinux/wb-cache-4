Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V neck bolted on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three [...] "see-thru" [...] single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil pick-up sounds.

The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a [...] "chicken head" [...] 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one <b>straight</b> <b>connection</b> to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Finding the {{shortest}} path between two positions {{is a fundamental}} problem in transportation, routing, and communications applications. In robot motion planning, the robot should pass around the obstacles touching none of them, i. e. {{the goal is to}} find a collision-free path from a starting to a target position. This task has many specific formulations depending on the shape of obstacles, allowable directions of movements, knowledge of the scene, etc. Research of path planning has yielded many fundamentally different approaches to its solution, mainly based on various decomposition and roadmap methods. In this paper, we show a possible use of visibility graphs in point-to-point motion planning in the Euclidean plane and an alternative approach using Voronoi diagrams that decreases the probability of collisions with obstacles. The second application area, investigated here, is focused on problems of finding minimal networks connecting a set of given points in the plane using either only <b>straight</b> <b>connections</b> between pairs of points (minimum spanning tree) or allowing the addition of auxiliary points to the set to obtain shorter spanning networks (minimum Steiner tree).

In particular, efficient energy funneling in 90 °-, 180 °-, and “S”-shaped bends are numerically and experimentally verified.

40|$|Abstract In map view, {{aftershocks}} of the 2004 Parkfield earthquake lie along a {{line that}} forms a <b>straighter</b> <b>connection</b> between San Andreas fault segments {{north and south of}} the Parkfield reach than does the mapped trace of the fault itself. A straightedge laid on a geologic map of Central California reveals a 50 -km-long asymmetric northeastward warp in the Parkfield reach of the fault. The warp tapers gradually as it joins the straight, creeping segment of the San Andreas to the north-west, but bends abruptly across Cholame Valley at its southeast end to join the straight, locked segment that last ruptured in 1857. We speculate that the San Andreas fault surface near Parkfield has been deflected in its upper 6 km by nonelastic behavior of upper crustal rock units. These units and the fault surface itself are warped during periods between large 1857 -type earthquakes by the presence of the 1857 -locked segment to the south, which buttresses intermittent coseismic and con-tinuous aseismic slip on the Parkfield reach. Because of nonelastic behavior, the warping is not completely undone when an 1857 -type event occurs, and the upper portion of the three-dimensional fault surface is slowly ratcheted into an increasingly prominent bulge. Ultimately, the fault surface probably becomes too deformed for strike-slip motion, and a new, more vertical connection to the Earth’s surface takes over, perhaps along the Southwest Fracture Zone. When this happens a wedge of material currently west of the main trace will be stranded {{on the east side of}} the new main trace...|$|R

40|$|These days ’ {{evolution}} of the on-line social networks has steered to new notions in social media, especially by giving users the opportunity to extend basic relationships beyond a normal <b>straight</b> <b>connection.</b> Many social network platforms have been developed on the Web such as Twitter and Facebook.

40|$|Background: Tunneling {{nanotubes}} (TNTs) {{may offer}} {{a very specific}} and effective way of intercellular communication. Here we investigated TNTs in the human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line ARPE- 19. Morphology of TNTs was examined by immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy. To determine the function of TNTs between cells, we studied the TNT-dependent intercellular communication at different levels including electrical and calcium signalling, small molecular diffusion as well as mitochondrial re-localization. Further, intercellular organelles transfer was assayed by FACS analysis. Methodology and Principal Findings: Microscopy showed that cultured ARPE- 19 cells are frequently connected by TNTs, which are not attached to the substratum. The TNTs were <b>straight</b> <b>connections</b> between cells, had a typical diameter of 50 to 300 nm and a length of up to 120 µm. We observed de novo formation of TNTs by diverging from migrating cells after a short time of interaction. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed characteristic features of TNTs. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that TNTs between ARPE- 19 cells contain F-actin but no microtubules. Depolymerisation of F-actin, induced by addition of latrunculin-B, led to disappearance of TNTs. Importantly, these TNTs could function as channels for the diffusion of small molecules such as Lucifer Yellow, but not for large molecules like Dextran Red. Further, organelle exchange between cells via TNTs was observed by microscopy. Using Ca 2 + imaging we show the intercellular transmission of calcium signals through TNTs. Mechanical stimulation led to membrane depolarisation, which expand through TNT connections between ARPE- 19 cells. We further demonstrate that TNTs can mediate electrical coupling between distant cells. Immunolabelling for Cx 43 showed that this gap junction protein is interposed {{at one end of}} 44 % of TNTs between ARPE- 19 cells. Conclusions and Significance: Our observations indicate that human RPE cell line ARPE- 19 cells communicate by tunneling nanotubes and can support different types of intercellular traffic. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{decompose}} the quark propagator in {{the presence}} of an arbitrary gluon field with respect to a set of Dirac matrices. The four-dimensional integrals which arise in first order perturbation theory are rewritten as line-integrals along certain field lines, together with a weighted integration over the various field lines. It is then easy to transform the propagator into a form involving path ordered exponentials. The resulting expression is non-perturbative and has the correct behavior under Lorentz transformations, gauge transformations and charge conjugation. Furthermore it coincides with the exact propagator in first order of the coupling g. No expansion with respect to the inverse quark mass is involved, the expression can even be used for vanishing mass. For large mass the field lines concentrate near the <b>straight</b> line <b>connection</b> and simple results can be obtained immediately. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures.

However, while {{the size of}} place fields in the hippocampal CA3 region remains the same between young and aged rats, average firing rate in this region is higher in aged rats. Young rats exhibit place field plasticity. When they are moving along a straight path, place fields are activated one after another. When young rats repeatedly traverse the same <b>straight</b> path, <b>connection</b> between place fields are strengthened due to plasticity, causing subsequent place fields to fire more quickly and causing place field expansion, possibly aiding young rats in spatial memory and learning. Recently, there has been debate as to whether there may be bidirectionality to place cell firing. However, this observed place field expansion and plasticity is decreased in aged rat subjects, possibly reducing their capacity for spatial learning and memory.|$|R

(2) It is a chemical ionization free interface (unless operated intentionally) with accurate reproduction of the expected isotope ion abundances. (3) Response is never influenced by matrix components in the sample or in the mobile phase (nonvolatile salts are also well accepted).
