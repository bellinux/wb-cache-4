The contribution of goats in supplying milk and milk products is high and it has signi cant role in rural economy and health. Goat milk contains higher amount of Ca, Mg and P than cow and human milk.

50|$|Curds are a {{dairy product}} {{obtained}} by coagulating {{milk in a}} process called curdling. The coagulation {{can be caused by}} adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to sit. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or <b>curds.</b> <b>Milk</b> that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce <b>curds,</b> and sour <b>milk</b> cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds {{is one of the first}} steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 80 percent of the proteins are caseins.|$|R

40|$|Background: Dry {{mouth is}} a common {{clinical}} problem, and different products have been proposed to improve it. In this investigation, the effects of "milk curd" {{on the amount of}} saliva secretion were studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 32 patients (aged 20 - 30) were selected from healthy volunteers. <b>Milk</b> <b>curd</b> concentrations of 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 %, and 2 % pilocarpine were prepared as drops. The impact of the drugs on the saliva weight was assessed after 1 - 5 min. To determine the effects of the pH of the <b>milk</b> <b>curd</b> on the amount of saliva secretion, different concentrations of acetic acid were used. Results: At {{the end of the first}} minute, the differences between the data for all groups were statistically significant, and the difference between the 2 % and 4 % <b>milk</b> <b>curd</b> groups was higher than the others (P < 0. 0001). The differences in the amount of the saliva secreted at the end of the second minute between the baseline and 4 % <b>milk</b> <b>curd</b> groups and between the 0. 5 % and 4 % MC groups were significant (P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 025, respectively).

40|$|One {{profitable}} {{project for}} village enterprises in coconut-growing areas is {{the making of}} coconut yoghurt. This product is both delicious and nutritious (on a par with yoghurt made from 100 % dairy milk). Some capital investment is required to buy equipment such as a coconut meat grater and a presser, autoclave, refrigerator, incubator, stove, blender, stainless steel mixing container and weighing scale. To make coco- yoghurt, starter cultures must first be prepared. To do this, a 10 % solution of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) is autoclaved for 10 mins at 10 psi, cooled, and divided in half; one half is inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus, and allowed to incubate for 14 hrs at 38 ° C, {{and the other half}} with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and incubated for 15 hrs at 42 ° C. The starters may now be stored at 5 ° C until use. Two textures of yoghurt may be made, a viscous one and a <b>soft</b> <b>curd</b> type. For the viscous, the milk base consists of 50 % coconut milk and 50 % NFDM; for the <b>soft</b> <b>curd,</b> the proportions are 44 % coconut milk to 56 % NFDM. The milk base is pasteurised at 85 ° C for 20 mins, cooled, and inoculated with 1. 5 % each of the previously prepared starter cultures. The mixture is poured into small yoghurt containers and then incubated at 42 ° C until the pH reaches 4. 5 - 4. 7. Coco-yoghurt can now be stored for 5 days at 5 ° C.
