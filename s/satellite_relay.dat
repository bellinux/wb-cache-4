Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.

During 1975 a major step toward the development of CO 2 laser systems for space-to-space applications is being completed.

40|$|Space Information Network (SIN) with {{backbone}} <b>satellites</b> <b>relaying</b> for vehicular network (VN) communications {{is regarded}} as an effective strategy to provide diverse vehicular services in a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective manner in rural areas and highways. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SIN return channel cooperative communications via an amplify-and-forward (AF) backbone <b>satellite</b> <b>relaying</b> for VN communications, where we assume that both of the source-destination and relay-destination links undergo Shadowed-Rician fading and the source-relay link follows Rician fading, respectively. In this SIN-assisted VN communication scenario, we first obtain the approximate statistical distributions of the equivalent end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions to efficiently evaluate the average symbol error rate (ASER) of the system. Furthermore, the ASER expressions are {{taking into account the}} effect of satellite perturbation of the backbone <b>relaying</b> <b>satellite,</b> which reveal the accumulated error of the antenna pointing error. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and show the impact of various parameters on the system performance...|$|R

To solve the dynamic scheduling problem, a new scheduling algorithm ABC-TOPSIS is proposed, which combines artificial bee colony (ABC) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The artificial bee colony algorithm is performed to solve the initial <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> scheduling. In addition, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is adopted for the selection of dynamic scheduling schemes. Plenty of simulation results are presented.
