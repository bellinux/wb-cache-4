5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. <b>Some</b> <b>health</b> effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. <b>Some</b> <b>health</b> issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E

25|$|Health {{insurance}} policies {{cover the cost}} of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive <b>some</b> <b>health</b> coverage from their governments, paid for by taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA {{sponsored}} scientific research on a plant-based food source that could generate oxygen and nutrition on long-duration space flights. Certain species of marine algae produced rich nutrients, {{leading to the}} development of an algae-based, vegetable-like oil that contains two polyunsaturated fatty acids, DHA and arachidonic acid, present in <b>some</b> <b>health</b> supplements.|$|E
25|$|Urinalysis tests urine {{for many}} analytes. <b>Some</b> <b>health</b> care {{providers}} have a urinalysis laboratory, while others don't. Instead, each {{component of the}} urinalysis is performed at the corresponding unit. If measuring urine chemicals is required, the specimen is processed in the clinical biochemistry lab, but if cell studies are indicated, the specimen should be submitted to the cytopathology lab, and so on.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} risks are very high. The most recent {{data showed that}} the number of new cases in China rose by 70,000 in 2005, which led to <b>some</b> <b>health</b> officials to raise concerns that infections were moving from high-risk groups into the broader population. The ministry attributes 37% of the new cases to drug use and 28% to unprotected sex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>health</b> {{organizations}} {{recommend that}} sexual activity be delayed after the miscarriage. The menstrual cycle should resume after {{about three to}} four months. Women report that the medical management of their miscarriage can be performed {{in a manner that}} can make the experience even worse than the event. Women report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006 NICE {{recommended}} that CCBT {{be made available}} for use within the NHS across England and Wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication, and CCBT is made available by <b>some</b> <b>health</b> systems.

25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry <b>some</b> <b>health</b> risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The Campbell {{government}} increased health funding by $3 billion {{during its}} first term in office to help meet the demand at hand and to increase wages for <b>some</b> <b>health</b> professionals.

At the same time, it nearly doubled the doctors in training, and opened new medical training facilities in Victoria and Prince George.|$|E
25|$|Although {{adoption}} of wine consumption {{is not recommended}} by <b>some</b> <b>health</b> authorities, a significant volume of research indicates moderate consumption, such as one {{glass of red wine}} a day for women and two for men, may confer health benefits. Emerging evidence is that wine polyphenols such as resveratrol provide physiological benefit, whereas alcohol itself may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. More may be seen in the article Long-term effects of alcohol.|$|E

25|$|For {{a health}} care institution, {{disclosing}} an unanticipated event should be made as soon as possible. <b>Some</b> <b>health</b> care organizations may have a policy regarding the disclosure of unanticipated events.

The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.|$|E
25|$|In North America, {{hospitals}} resisted {{adoption of}} meter glucose measurements for inpatient diabetes care {{for over a}} decade. Managers of laboratories argued that the superior accuracy of a laboratory glucose measurement outweighed the advantage of immediate availability and made meter glucose measurements unacceptable for inpatient diabetes management.
