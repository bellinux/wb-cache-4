40|$|Zero Inventory (ZI) {{is a new}} and {{powerful}} concept to improve production efficiency. Underpinning ZI is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs are cut. The folklore is that <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. <b>Set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of <b>set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction is provided. Most presentations of ZI have been descriptive with very few mathematical models of it yet untaken. By modeling certain ZI concepts mathematically, we scrutinize their validity and sometimes invalidity. inventory/production: zero inventory, facilities/equipment: planning, inventory/production: parametric analysis...|$|R
