5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically <b>superimpose</b> the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies <b>superimpose</b> a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

It can be used for organizing, highlighting, annotating, connecting, and reusing selected elements within information sources. With the growing amount of digital information available today, especially on the web, more and more applications are being developed that use <b>superimposed</b> information. However, generic support to store, create, update, and transform <b>superimposed</b> information does not exist. <b>Superimposed</b> applications must implement their own representation and storage capabilities, which also makes <b>superimposed</b> information difficult to share across applications. We seek to represent <b>superimposed</b> information {{for a wide variety of}} model-based applications (e. g., XML and CASE tools, Topic Map navigators, SQL, and even spreadsheet editors) that use <b>superimposed</b> information. Our solution leverages a metamodel that is used to define multiple superimposed-information models. We employ a flat representation scheme, using the Resource Description Framework, to represent models (defined by our metamodel), schemas, and instances of <b>superimposed</b> information. As a result, we are able to provide model-based applications with a uniform, generic representation of <b>superimposed</b> information. While the generic representation is stored explicitly, it need not be visible to an application, which we support through a variety of application programming interfaces. The APIs provide ease of use and rapid superimposed-application development. The representation also enables mappings between <b>superimposed</b> layers, which allows applications to dynamically share <b>superimposed</b> information. 1...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} of <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia in women with essential chronic hypertension receiving antihypertensive therapy prior to conception. Methods: A retrospective study of 211 patients that analyzed {{risk factors of}} <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia at first prenatal visit. Variables with a p,. 1 at univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression analysis. P,. 05 was considered as significant. Results: <b>Superimposed</b> preeclampsia occurred in 49 (23. 2 %) women. In logistic regression analysis, previous preeclampsia [OR: 4. 05 (1. 61 – 10. 16) ], and mean arterial blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher [OR: 4. 60 (1. 94 – 10. 93) ] were associated with increased risk of <b>superimposed</b> preeclampsia.

25|$|Images of auroras are {{significantly}} more common today {{than in the}} past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities. Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectrum present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important. Longer exposures <b>superimpose</b> rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.|$|E

Let N(T,w, r) be the minimum length N for which an (N, T,w, r) <b>superimposed</b> code exists. The (N, T,w, r) <b>superimposed</b> code is called optimal when N = N(T,w, r).

25|$|In {{the years}} 1913 and 1914 Braque and Picasso {{attempted}} {{to eliminate the}} use of color as chiaroscuro, which had still persisted to some extent in their painting, by amalgamating painting and sculpture. Instead of having to demonstrate through shadows how one plane stands above, or {{in front of a}} second plane, they could now <b>superimpose</b> the planes one on the other and illustrate the relationship directly. The first attempts to do this go far back. Picasso had already begun such an enterprise in 1909, but since he did it within the limits of closed form, it was destined to fail. It resulted in a kind of colored bas-relief. Only in open planal form could this union of painting and sculpture be realized. Despite current prejudice, this endeavor to increase plastic expression through the collaboration of the two arts must be warmly approved; an enrichment of the plastic arts is certain to result from it. A number of sculptors like Lipchitz, Laurens and Archipenko have since taken up and developed this sculpto-painting.|$|E
25|$|The Cold War (1947–1991) {{provided}} a global network {{of material and}} ideological support that often helped perpetuate civil wars, which were mainly fought in weak ex-colonial states rather than the relatively strong states that were aligned with the Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In some cases, superpowers would <b>superimpose</b> Cold War ideology onto local conflicts, while in others local actors using Cold War ideology would {{attract the attention of}} a superpower to obtain support. Using a separate statistical evaluation than used above for interventions, civil wars that included pro- or anti-communist forces lasted 141% longer than the average non-Cold War conflict, while a Cold War civil war that attracted superpower intervention resulted in wars typically lasting over three times as long as other civil wars. Conversely, the end of the Cold War marked by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 resulted in a reduction in the duration of Cold War civil wars of 92% or, phrased another way, a roughly ten-fold increase in the rate of resolution of Cold War civil wars. Lengthy Cold War-associated civil conflicts that ground to a halt include the wars of Guatemala (1960–1996), El Salvador (1979–1991) and Nicaragua (1970–1990).|$|E
25|$|After Lee's death, the {{producers}} {{were faced with}} the decision {{of whether or not}} to continue with the film. Lee had completed most of his scenes for the film and was scheduled to shoot for only three more days. The rest of the cast and crew, except for Ernie Hudson, whose brother-in-law had just died, stayed in Wilmington. Paramount, which was initially interested in distributing The Crow theatrically (originally a direct-to-video feature), opted out of involvement due to delays in filming and some controversy over the violent content being inappropriate given Lee's death. However, Miramax picked it up with the intention of releasing it in theatres and injected a further $8 million to complete the production, taking its budget to approximately $23 million. The cast and crew then took a break for script rewrites of the flashback scenes that had yet to be completed. The script was rewritten by Walon Green, Rene Balcer and Michael S. Chernuchin, adding narration and new scenes. Lee's stunt double Chad Stahelski was used as a stand-in and CGI was used to digitally <b>superimpose</b> Lee's face onto the head of the double. The beginning of the movie, which had not been finished, was rewritten, and the apartment scene remade using computer graphics from an earlier scene of Lee.|$|E

25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will <b>superimpose</b> on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
