5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or <b>shared</b> distributed memory. <b>Shared</b> memory programming languages communicate by manipulating <b>shared</b> memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used <b>shared</b> memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E

50|$|A split <b>share</b> {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of covered options) of a basket of <b>shares</b> of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded <b>shares</b> in the split <b>share</b> corporation. Most commonly a split <b>share</b> {{corporation is}}sues equal numbers of <b>shares</b> from a class of preferred <b>shares</b> and a class of capital or class A <b>shares.</b> The proceeds of the <b>share</b> offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying <b>shares</b> according to the regulations of the split <b>share</b> corporation. The preferred <b>shares</b> typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a fixed coupon rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the split <b>share</b> corporation is wound up. The capital <b>shares</b> often (but not in every corporation) pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the capital <b>shares</b> offer participation in the leveraged capital gains (or losses) of the underlying basket of conventional <b>shares.</b>|$|R
