In April 2007, naval architect Ken Brower said, [...] "As a <b>ship</b> <b>pitches</b> and heaves at sea, if you have tumblehome instead of a flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come back up.

[...] The decision to not use a tumblehome hull in the CG(X) cruiser, before the program was canceled, may suggest that there were concerns regarding Zumwalts seakeeping. However, in a 1/4 scale test of the hull design, named Sea Jet, the tumblehome hull proved seaworthy.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiomimetic {{flapping}} foils attached on ship hull are {{studied for}} wave-energy extraction, stored in ship motions, and direct conversion to propulsive power.

The fins gain their linear oscillation (heaving) from <b>ship</b> <b>pitching</b> and heaving responses in irregular waves, while wing's rotation (pitching) is properly controlled with respect to its vertical motion history. A method, developed in our previous works, is applied for that purpose. The system operates in realistic sea conditions modeled by using parametric spectra, taking into account the coupling between ship responses and the hydrodynamics of the lifting appendages. We present numerical calculations concerning the operation of the augmenting system indicating that, although the present arrangement is designed for roll reduction purposes it can obtain significant amount of thrust. Also it is illustrated that, after reposition of the fins near the bow, the performance of the system can be further enhanced...|$|E

40|$|A {{helicopter}} {{is becoming}} {{a component of the}} modern surface ships and multifunctional courts, giving them absolutely new qualities as well as increasing their productivity and efficiency. Take off and landing are thought to be the most responsible stages of helicopters flight. The electro-optical system giving some visual information to the pilot about correctness of helicopter position concerning a glide path is called the glide path indicator. To prevent the influence onboard and carrier pitching motion on visual axis position of the device in space stabilization systems are used. The glide path indicator forms three horizontal color bands glowing constantly and, adjoining to each other in space. The visual axis of the central band coincides with a glide path, the band over it is called - ?above a glide path?, under the central band is called - ?below a glide path?. Observing certain color of radiation, the pilot defines the aircraft position and changes its altitude for glide slope interception. It?s required to adhere to the central zone for correct helicopter landing. The main functions of the indicator of a glide path is to project radiation with the necessary light intensity, with the necessary geometry of bands and to prevent onboard and <b>ship</b> <b>pitching</b> motion. Glide path indicators are absolutely necessary on the aviabearing ships. In due course these systems have been improved and now represent reliable complex solutions. ????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????? ???? ? ?????. ???????? ???????????? ???? ?????????, ????? ?????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????. ??? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????...|$|E
