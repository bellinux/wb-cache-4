His father was also the maternal uncle of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> whom <b>would</b> later marry Khairallah's sister, Sajida Talfah. Khairallah attended the Baghdad Military College and the Staff College, and later graduated with a degree from the Baghdad University School of Law and Politics in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Before the war, {{public opinion}} polls showed that the {{majority}} of British people would have supported the war with a clear UN mandate for war, but were strongly opposed to war without another resolution in addition to Resolution 1441, which indicated that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> face serious consequences if he failed to comply with the resolution.|$|E
50|$|On March 12, 2003, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Tony Blair, and the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jack Straw {{proposed}} a draft {{resolution to the}} United Nations.

50|$|The Iraqi Army {{officers}} {{planning to}} kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed {{before they could}} carry out the operation. The PUK's offensive was still launched as planned, and within days they managed to destroy three Iraqi Army divisions and capture 5,000 prisoners. Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was offered, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw. Baer was immediately recalled from Iraq and briefly investigated for the attempted murder of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> He <b>would</b> later be cleared.|$|R
50|$|The Castle {{would become}} {{insignificant}} as the Jaff leadership would eventually flee to Persia, and become {{close to the}} Pahlavis. In 1989 <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in {{a visit to the}} region to strengthen relations with Kurds would go on tour of much of the old structures of the region. He was much interested in making an Iraqi historiagraphy. The Castle of Sherwana {{would be one of the}} structures he visited. He would give it much publicity together with Jaff scholars. The Sherwana Castle would be declared as a historic site under <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> It <b>would</b> eventually be given a specific government agency to manage it. Today, it Houses the Museam of Kalar, which has many historic artifacts of the Jaff tribe.|$|R
5|$|The attack would {{consist of}} a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a {{blocking}} force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> theorized <b>would</b> be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.|$|R
50|$|Mirror-imaging {{can be a}} {{major problem}} for policymakers, as well as analysts. During the Vietnam War, Johnson and McNamara assumed that Ho Chi Minh would react to {{situations}} {{in the same manner as}} they themselves. Similarly, in the run-up to the Gulf War, there was a serious misapprehension—independent of politically motivated intelligence manipulation—that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> view the situation vis-à-vis Kuwait as the State Department and White House viewed it.|$|E
5000|$|... : In Indonesia, the world's {{most populous}} Muslim nation, the {{reaction}} was muted. Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says the arrest of the former Iraqi president had not changed how Indonesia felt {{about the situation in}} Iraq. Indonesia's leaders strongly opposed the U-S-led invasion of Iraq. Indonesian leaders also said they hoped the capture of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> help bring peace to Iraq and return control of the country back to its citizens.|$|E
5000|$|Leon Jaroff, in Time, {{pointed out}} that the Jamison twins were also {{frequently}} incorrect. For example, in December 2003, the Twins predicted that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> be killed by U.S troops in early 2004, and that Pope John Paul II would die in June 2004 (he actually died in April 2005). They also incorrectly predicted that the Bush/Gore election would be a [...] "crashing bore", and that actress Jennifer Lopez would announce that she was pregnant by June 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Iraq also {{targeted}} Iranian civilians {{with chemical}} weapons. Many thousands {{were killed in}} attacks on populations in villages and towns, as well as front-line hospitals. Many still suffer from the severe effects. In December 2006, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> said he <b>would</b> take responsibility [...] "with honour" [...] for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the 1980–1988 war but he took issue with charges that he ordered attacks on Iraqis.|$|R
50|$|As {{he grew up}} he also {{developed}} a passion for wrestling and weightlifting, becoming a world-class athlete. Many of his sporting adventures held danger and he remembers that every time the Iraqi team did badly the leader of Iraqi sports, <b>Saddam's</b> son Uday <b>Hussein,</b> <b>would</b> order that everyone have their heads and eyebrows shaved and {{on at least one}} occasion, they were put in prison.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2002, {{the term}} {{has been used}} by {{politicians}} and pundits alike. Shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US Defense undersecretary Douglas J. Feith noted that once free of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> Iraq <b>would</b> no longer suffer from a freedom deficit. US President George W. Bush acknowledged the role of Western nations in contributing to the freedom deficit in the Middle East. The conservative American Enterprise Institute issued a commentary in 2004 defending the War on Terrorism as being crucial to ending the freedom deficit. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice used the term in December 2006 during a press conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to describe the [...] "core problem" [...] of the Middle East.|$|R

And if we stood by idly, two, three years, at the most four years, and <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> have {{produced}} his three, four, five bombs. ... Then, this country and this people would have been lost, after the Holocaust. Another Holocaust would {{have happened in the}} history of the Jewish people. Never again, never again! Tell so your friends, tell anyone you meet, we shall defend our people with all the means at our disposal. We shall not allow any enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction turned against us." ...|$|E
5000|$|On February 7, 2003, VIPS {{released}} a [...] "Memorandum for The President" [...] criticizing US Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech before the United Nations and stating that VIPS was afraid <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> use his chemical weapons against U.S. troops if the U.S. invaded. In May 2003, 70 {{days after the}} invasion, The New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof noted that {{no weapons of mass}} destruction had been found in Iraq and noted that VIPS was among the many then-current and former officials who decried the Bush Administration's misuse of intelligence information. In early 2004, chief US weapons inspector David Kay stated that no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction could be found in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, the Armenian {{community}} flourished as {{a result}} of President Saddam Hussein's modernization efforts, as it continued to rebuild its cultural institutions and even consecrated an imposing cathedral in Baghdad. Saddam retained many Armenians among his personal entourage: his nanny was Iraqi-Armenian, along with one of his body guards, his jeweler, tailor, and housestaff. One of his mistresses was Juliet N. Gurjian. The Armenians benefited under the secularist rule of the Baath party, which strongly suppressed the Islamist forces especially the Shiite Iraqi elements that would later rise against Saddam. The Armenians also did not support anyone in the opposition so the Hussein regime count on their loyalty and consequently grant them many rights. During Christmas, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> order large amount of flowers to be taken to the Baghdad Armenian church.|$|E

She {{accompanied}} {{her husband to}} Jordan in 1995, where she lived from August 8 of that year to February 20, 1996. They returned to Iraq after receiving assurances from <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> that he <b>would</b> pardon Kamel and his brother, Hussein Kamel al-Majid. Despite this promise, {{before the end of}} the month both Kamels were shot and killed by other clan members who declared them traitors.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, the PNAC {{sent a letter}} to President George W. Bush, advocating [...] "a {{determined}} effort to remove <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> from power in Iraq", or regime change. The letter suggested that [...] "any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> from power in Iraq," [...] even if no evidence surfaced linking Iraq to the September 11 attacks. The letter warned that allowing Hussein to remain in power would be [...] "an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism." [...] From 2001 through the invasion of Iraq, the PNAC and many of its members voiced active support for military action against Iraq, and asserted leaving <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in power <b>would</b> be [...] "surrender to terrorism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Justifying {{the attack}} on Iran, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> accused Iranians of [...] "murdering the second (Umar), third (Uthman), and fourth (Ali) Caliphs of Islam". In March 1988, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> killed about 20,000 Iranian {{soldiers}} immediately using nerve-gas agents. According to Iraqi documents, assistance in developing chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the United Kingdom, France and China.Iraq also targeted Iranian civilians with chemical weapons. Many thousands were killed in attacks on populations in villages and towns, as well as front-line hospitals. Many still suffer from the severe effects. In December 2006, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> said he <b>would</b> take responsibility [...] "with honour" [...] for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the 1980-1988 war but he took issue with charges that he ordered attacks on Iraqis.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{than one}} year later, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> again deploy Iraqi forces close to its border with Kuwait. In August, Third Army/ARCENT {{provided}} command and control for a rapid deployment of a heavy brigade task force. Once more, Iraqi threats were met while ARCENT simultaneously conducted a major training exercise in Egypt, [...] "BRIGHT STAR 95," [...] involving military forces from 6 other nations. This contingency operation validated critical procedures for deployment, particularly the off-loading of equipment from floating prepositioning ships and its distribution to arriving soldiers. The deployment of a [...] "Fly-Away Package" [...] of key contingency staff also validated procedures for a rapidly deployed command and control group able to conduct combat operations immediately upon arrival.The operation was described by Third Army as having convinced Hussein to withdraw his forces from the Kuwaiti border.|$|E
5000|$|Outside the Middle East, Iraq {{maintained}} correct {{relations with}} other countries. Iraq identified itself {{as part of the}} Nonaligned Movement of primarily African and Asian nations, actively participated in its deliberations during the late 1970s, and successfully lobbied to have Baghdad chosen as the site for its September 1982 conference. Although significant resources were expended to prepare facilities for the conference, and <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> have emerged from the meeting as a recognized leader of the Nonaligned Movement, genuine fears of an Iranian bombing of the capital during the summer of 1982 forced the government reluctantly to request that the venue of the conference be transferred to New Delhi. Since that time, preoccupation with the war against Iran, which also {{is a member of the}} Nonaligned Movement, has tended to restrict the scope of Iraqi participation in that organization. http://reference.allrefer.com/country-guide-study/iraq/iraq82.html ...|$|E
5000|$|Iraqis should [...] "be {{given the}} right to decide on the manner and {{procedure}} of bringing Saddam Hussein to face justice," [...] said Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, head of the Non-Aligned Movement. Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar expressed hope that the capture of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> contribute towards bringing peace and stability in Iraq and the surrounding region and stated that the United Nations should now play a bigger role in achieving this objective. [...] "With peace and stability in Iraq, we hope that an Iraqi government representing the free and independent Iraqi people could be set up to start the reconstruction process of that nationfor the benefit of its people," [...] he said. He said the views and inputs of the Iraqis should be taken into account in deciding whatever action would be initiated against Saddam. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed urged a fair trial for Saddam Hussein.|$|E
5000|$|News {{that the}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> trial verdict <b>would</b> be {{rendered}} on November 5, 2006, {{just two days}} ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, led Tom Engelhardt of liberal magazine The Nation to dub it, on October 17, the [...] "November Surprise". In a White House Press gaggle on November 4, 2006, a reporter suggested that {{the timing of the}} verdict might be an attempt to influence the outcome of the November election, to which White House Press Secretary Tony Snow replied [...] "Are you smoking rope?" [...] Snow later told CNN's Late Edition, [...] "The idea is preposterous, that somehow we've been scheming and plotting with the Iraqis".|$|R
5000|$|Former UK Minister of Defence Geoff Hoon {{commented on}} this issue in 2007 and said, [...] "There was an {{enormous}} amount of post-war planning. It's {{one of the things that}} the newspapers have never troubled to look at. I accept, and I've said so publicly, that we perhaps did not anticipate quite the kinds of trouble that we would have. I think we thought that because the population of Iraq hated <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> they <b>would</b> simply come out on the streets and everything would be fine... I don't think we quite estimated the degree of control that Saddam's people had in Iraqi society... So the kind of things we were planning for, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps weren't quite the right things. But they were the right things in terms of the problems that we anticipated, which was the lack of food, water. We probably didn't quite appreciate, as I say, the ruthlessness of some of Saddam's followers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Flake {{voted in}} favor of the Iraq Resolution (authorizing the Iraq War) in the House of Representatives in October 2002. In a debate on the House floor on the {{authorization}} of force (October 8, 2002), Flake said, [...] "We ought to let history be our guide here. But the most recent history in this case that we ought to look at is the vote that took place in this Chamber 12 years ago. During that time, we faced a very similar decision. Should we thwart <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in his attempt to go beyond his boundaries or should we appease him? Fortunately, the majority of this body and the other body agreed we ought to thwart him; and I think we can all agree that, had we not done so, that the biological and chemical weapons that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> possesses <b>would</b> be added to nuclear weapons which he would certainly possess today had he not been thwarted at that time. We are in this position today, I would submit, because we have no other choice. This is our only reasonable option. War will no doubt come at great cost. When we visit the war memorials, we see that cost, but the cost of appeasement is far greater. I commend the House leadership for bringing this resolution forward and for shepherding it through process. I especially commend our President who so forcefully pushed for this resolution and who has so deliberately pushed for this resolution. I urge support for the resolution." ...|$|R
5000|$|Besides also citing Luttwak’s prediction, in {{response}} to a question, of the impoverishing of all but a small minority of Americans [...] "soon enough", Posner wrote that Luttwak predicted, shortly before the first Persian Gulf War, that Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> evacuate Kuwait [...] "after a week or two of bombing (the bombing continued for six weeks without inducing him to do so) and warned that the use of ground forces ‘could make Desert Storm a bloody, grinding combat with thousands of (U.S.) casualties.’ The ground fighting lasted only four days, rather than the minimum of two weeks that Luttwak predicted, and U.S. casualties were minimal. Writing a month into the bombing, Luttwak was no longer predicting heavy casualties but he still opposed a ground campaign. He thought it would lead inevitably to a military occupation of Iraq from which we would be unable to disengage without disastrous foreign policy consequences." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 6, 2003 Winfrey did a {{show called}} “What You Should Know About Iraq,” in which Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges {{described}} {{the suffering of the}} Iraqi people since Operation Desert Storm. Gerges argued that the desire of the Bush administration to overthrow <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> have a devastating effect on the Iraqi people. Dan Rather also talked about his interview with Saddam Hussein, in which Hussein was apparently curious about George W. Bush and the will of the American people to attack Iraq. The guests on the show explained that the United States had worked with several dictators in the past and actively aided Hussein during the administration of Ronald Reagan to keep the Islamic fundamentalist movement in Iran from spreading. On Oprah After The Show (aired on Winfrey's cable network Oxygen (now owned by NBC Universal)), Gerges urged Winfrey's audience not to believe reports linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11th attacks, reports which Oprah Winfrey condemned as [...] "propaganda." ...|$|E
3000|$|A {{reasonable}} way {{to understand}} the proposed analogy between Iraq in 1991 and Germany in 1939 would pair proposition 1 a with proposition 2 a, and 1 b with 2 b. <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> then be paired with Hitler, Iraq with Germany, being president with being führer, and so on. As noted above, though, ACME’s procedure is to generate nodes for all possible mappings that are syntactically appropriate, and then determine which mappings are correct {{through the process of}} settling the analogy network. I summarize the possible mappings that ACME would construct involving elements of the four propositions in Figure 2. Representations of propositions are given in the top and left margins. The existence of a box at the intersection of a row and a column means that ACME will construct a network node representing a possible mapping between those propositions. When ACME creates a node for each of these mappings, it also creates links which capture the constraints mentioned above. For example, the node representing the mapping [...]...|$|E
