A similar site, <b>Something</b> <b>Awful,</b> sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically pleasing image or to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill, which is then voted on by others in the forum.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2003, the spam {{filtering}} organization Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS) {{added an}} entire class-B subnet with the Cogent ISP to their spammer list, since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block. <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> {{was added to}} the list in the process, disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS. Upon appeal, SPEWS initially refused to delist SA. The <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> administrators responded by telling their users to post their support in the Usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting. However, that group and news.admin.net-abuse.email were flooded with off-topic posts and trolls from <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> users, incensing SPEWS advocates. The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> server. Forum users responded by threatening to perform a distributed denial of service attack on SPEWS, although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons.|$|E

500|$|The Slender Man (also {{known as}} Slenderman) is a fictional supernatural {{character}} that originated as a creepypasta Internet meme created by <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> forums user Eric Knudsen (also known as [...] "Victor Surge") in 2009.

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} the Slender Man mythos first {{appeared}} on the original <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> thread. One of the earliest additions was added by a forum user named [...] "Thoreau Up", who created a folklore story set in 16th-century Germany involving a character called Der Grossman, which was implied to be an early reference to the Slender Man. The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> thread by user [...] "ce gars". It tells of a fictional film school friend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature-length project, Marble Hornets. The video series, published in found footage style on YouTube, forms an alternate reality game describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The ARG also incorporates a Twitter feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named [...] "totheark". As of 2013, Marble Hornets had over 250,000 subscribers around the world, and 55 million views. Other Slender Man-themed YouTube serials followed, including EverymanHYBRID and TribeTwelve.|$|E

500|$|... 4chan {{was started}} in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City whose 4chan handle is [...] "moot". Prior to {{starting}} 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> forums. He intended 4chan to be an American counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel ("2chan") imageboard {{and a place to}} discuss manga and anime. Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> subforum titled [...] "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website. Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's Babelfish online translator. During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: [...] "/a/ – Anime/General" [...] and [...] "/b/ – Anime/Random" [...] (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply [...] "/b/ – Random".|$|E

500|$|Although {{nearly all}} users {{understand}} that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief {{in order to become}} more engrossed when telling or listening to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as [...] "difficult to pinpoint." [...] Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the <b>Something</b> <b>Awful</b> forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real.|$|E
500|$|As word of Henderson's {{challenge}} to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with bloggers as well as humor and Internet culture websites.

Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged. As public awareness grew, the mainstream media {{picked up on the}} phenomenon.

Several groups of people seem to take a bit more abuse than others on the site, including PETA, Catholic priests, the French, and Duke University, according to Curtis. The site has also become somewhat well known for including [...] "NSFW" [...] (Not Safe For Work) in the headlines of links that contain images or videos of a sensitive nature, and in 2007, attempted to file a trademark of the phrase.

500|$|The second {{series of}} Inside No. 9 was filmed {{from the end}} of 2014 into early 2015.

The one chosen was close to Twickenham Studios. A [...] "deckhouse" [...] was added to the house's garden; despite there already being two sheds, neither would have been visible on-screen. A new one was thus added. The executive producer Adam Tandy suggested that deckhouse would be preferable to shed, as the latter term suggested the site of <b>something</b> <b>awful.</b> Scenes in a bedroom used the room mostly as the production team found it.
