We describe an unusual case of a young patient with Cushing’s disease who was treated with strontium ranelate for low bone mass who experienced spontaneous sellar reossification after transsphenoidal surgery. A 21 -year-old male presented with Cushing’s features. His past medical history included delayed puberty diagnosed at 16  years, treated with testosterone for 3  years without further work-up. He was diagnosed with Cushing’s disease initially treated with transsphenoidal surgery, which was not curative. The patient did not come to follow-up visits for more than 1  year. He was prescribed strontium ranelate 2 g orally once daily for low bone mass by an outside endocrinologist, which he received for more than 1  year. Two years after first surgery he was reevaluated and persisted with active Cushing’s disease.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the phase}} out of Halon {{extinguishers}} in the 1980 s, hot aerosol fire suppression technology has gained much attention. Unlike traditional inert gas, foam, water mist and Halon fire suppression agents, hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents {{do not need}} to be driven out by pressurized gases and can extinguish class A, B, C, D and K fires at 30 to 200 g/m 3. Generally, hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology has developed from a generation I oil tank suppression system to a generation III <b>strontium</b> <b>salt</b> based S-type system. S-type hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology greatly solves the corrosion problem of electrical devices and electronics compared to potassium salt based generation I & II hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology. As substitutes for Halon agents, the ODP and GWP values of hot fire extinguishing aerosols are nearly zero, but those fine aerosol particles can cause adverse health effects once inhaled by human. As for configurations of hot aerosol fire extinguishing devices, fixed or portable cylindrical canisters are the most common among generation II & III hot aerosol fire extinguishers across the world, while generation I hot aerosol fire suppression systems are integrated with the oil tank as a whole. Some countries like the U. S., Australia, Russia and China, etc. have already developed standards for manufacturing and quality control of hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents and norms for hot aerosol fire extinguishing system design under different fire protection scenarios. Coolants in hot aerosol fire suppression systems, which are responsible for reducing hot aerosol temperature to avoid secondary fire risk are reviewed for the first time. Cooling effects are generally achieved through vaporization and endothermic chemical decomposition of coolants. Finally, this review discussed areas applying generation I, II or III hot aerosol fire suppression technologies. The generation III hot aerosol fire extinguishing system is most applicable, especially in areas involving delicate electrical and electronic equipments. Nonetheless, developing a much cleaner, non-corrosive and highly efficient hot aerosol fire suppression system is still needed...|$|E

A "Handigas" butane-propane mixture) -air flame was used for most of this work, but a coal-gas-air flame was also studied and found to give slightly greater sensitivity. The method was found to be subject to interference from many elements. Strontium salts, employed as releasing agents to overcome the effect of other elements, were not completely effective as milligram amounts of several elements interfered even when strontium was present. Among the more serious interfering elements are: aluminium, iron, manganese and zirconium (less than 20 p. p. m. interfere); the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts (more than 200 - 500 p. p. m. interfere); phosphate (more than 100 p. p. m. P₂ 0 ₅ uranium (more than 4, 000 p. p. m.); arsenate and vanadate. An attempt is made to explain the mechanism of some of these interfering effects. A combination of <b>strontium</b> <b>salt</b> and acetyl acetone was found to over-come the effects of small amounts of several elements that form complexes with acetyl acetone (e. g. iron and aluminium) far more effectively than strontium alone. Larger amounts of many interfering elements are removed by a solvent extraction procedure employing acetyl acetone and chloroform. Elements which cannot be removed by this means may be separated by anion-exchange, volatilisation, electrolysis or precipitation. A spiking technique, which compensates JT/GB for the effects of small amounts of interfering elements, is described and enables many samples to be analysed without prior separations. The method described has good sensitivity (the limit of determination is approximately 1 microgram of magnesium in 50 ml. of solution). It has been applied to the analysis of clay samples, iron ore, limestone and uranium metal, oxides and processing solutions. The coefficient of variation of the method was determined using two clay samples and results of 2. 0 and 4. 6 percent, at magnesium oxide concentrations of 0. 65 and 0. 22 percent respectively, wore obtained. The speed of the method compares favourably with others described for the determination of microgram amounts of magnesium, but increases if large amounts of interfering elements are present...|$|E

40|$|More {{than one}} million people {{worldwide}} receive some kind of bone graft each year. Grafts are often needed following bone tumour removal or traumatic fractures to fill voids in the bone and {{to aid in the}} healing process. The most common method involves bone transplantation, in which bone tissue is taken from one site to fill the defect in another site. The procedure thus involves two surgeries, which leads to an increased risk of complications. New, synthetic graft materials {{that can be used to}} fill defects and minimise the complications associated with bone tissue harvesting are therefore necessary. The synthetic materials available today lack the inherent biological factors of bone that stimulate the bone regeneration process. Much of today’s research concerning synthetic bone graft materials aims to solve this issue and researchers have suggested several different strategies. The purpose of this thesis is to improve the performance of acidic calcium phosphate cements, which are materials used as synthetic bone grafts. By combining these cements with drugs or ion additives, local delivery could be achieved with the potential to stimulate bone formation. Two different combinations were attempted in this thesis: cement in combination with simvastatin, or cement in combination with <b>strontium</b> halide <b>salts.</b> Both simvastatin and strontium are known to positively affect bone formation. The efficacy of the cements with the additives was evaluated using different bone cell cultures. The results regarding simvastatin showed that the cement’s mechanical property was not affected upon drug loading, and that the drug was released by a diffusion-controlled mechanism. Moreover, results showed that simvastatin stimulated the bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) to produce more bone tissue, while it inhibited bone-degrading cells (osteoclasts) from degrading the cement. These findings suggest that simvastatin could aid in the bone regeneration process in the local area surrounding the cement. The main purpose of the study using <b>strontium</b> halide <b>salts</b> was to increase the cement’s X-ray contrast, which is a property used to monitor cement during injection. In addition, strontium is believed to positively affect bone cells. The X-ray contrast did increase after the addition of 10 wt% strontium bromide or strontium iodide, while the cell study results did not indicate any significant effects on the bone-forming cells. In the last section of this thesis, zebrafish were used as a model to evaluate bone formation upon treatment with degradation products from synthetic bone grafts. The zebrafish is a small organism with 70 % gene homology to humans; due to its transparency, fast development and ease of handling, it is an interesting model for high-throughput studies. Silicate, which is an ionic degradation product of many different bone substitute materials, was used as a proof-of-concept to visualise bone formation in these fish. The results showed an increased bone formation upon treatment with 0. 625 μM silicate ions. The results suggest that this model could be used as a complement to bone cell culture studies in pre-clinical evaluations of the degradation products of bone substitute materials, thus helping researchers to design materials with degradation products that could stimulate bone formation...|$|R
