5000|$|From 1911 to 1913, Murry was {{editor of}} the {{literary}} magazine Rhythm, which was later renamed The Blue Review. In 1913 an associate, the publisher Charles Granville of Stephen Swift Ltd, {{was found guilty of}} embezzlement and bigamy and imprisoned. As some debts had been put in Murry’s name their finances were seriously affected for the next six years. In 1914 he met D. H. Lawrence, and became an important supporter. The next year they started a short-lived magazine together, The Signature. In 1931, after a complex evolution of the relationship, Murry wrote in Son of Woman one of the first and most influential posthumous assessments of Lawrence as a man. Medically certified as unfit for military service, with pleurisy and possible tuberculosis, during the war years {{he was part of the}} Garsington circle of Ottoline Morrell. In 1919, Murry became the {{editor of the}} Athenaeum, recently purchased by Arthur Rowntree. Under his editorship it was a literary review that featured work by T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, and other members of the Bloomsbury Group. It lasted until 1921. It had enthusiastic support from E. M. Forster, who later wrote that [...] "Here at last was a paper that was a pleasure to read and an honour to write for, and which linked up literature and life". Its fate was to be merged into The Nation, which became The Nation and Athenaeum, in the period 1923 to 1930 edited by H. D. Henderson. In 1923 he became the founding editor of The Adelphi (The New Adelphi, 1927-30), in association with Jack Common and Max Plowman. The magazine continued in various forms until 1948. It reflected his <b>successive</b> <b>interests</b> in Lawrence, an unorthodox Marxism, pacifism, and a return to the land. According to David Goldie, Murry and the Adelphi, and Eliot and the Criterion, were in an important rivalry by the mid-1920s, with competing definitions of literature, based respectively on romanticism allied to liberalism and a subjective approach, and a form of classicism allied to traditionalism and a religious attitude. In this contest, Goldie says, Eliot emerged a clear victor, in the sense that in the 1930s London Eliot had taken the centre of the critical stage.|$|E

2500|$|From 2000 to 2001, the Federal Reserve, {{in a move}} {{to protect}} the economy from the overvalued stock market, made <b>successive</b> <b>interest</b> rate increases; while this may have {{initiated}} the readjustment, it is starkly contrasted with the severe, prolonged recession that would have occurred had the unsustainable growth continued unabated.

5000|$|After gaining {{market share}} in the late 1990s and making {{enormous}} profits, General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. From June 1999 to September 2000, the Federal Reserve, in a move to quell potential inflationary pressures created by, among other things, the stock market, made <b>successive</b> <b>interest</b> rate increases, credited in part for [...] "plunging the country into a recession." [...] The recession and the volatile stock market created a pension and benefit fund crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motors' rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan. Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moreover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return. In 2003, GM responded to the crisis by fully funding its pension fund with a $15 B payment; however, its Other Post Employment Benefits Fund (OPEB) became a serious issue resulting in downgrades to its bond rating in 2005. Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan.|$|R

[...] Liviu only learned of the execution in 1919, but quickly made several visits to the area, ultimately publishing the book in 1922. When he {{found out about the}} hanging, he had already been thinking of a novel drawing upon Emil's letters from the front describing the atmosphere there. Subsequently, he incorporated what Emil had undergone into the book. Nevertheless, he made important changes, describing his brother as an [...] "unscrupulous nationalist" [...] whose true character would have inspired [...] "at most a patriotic poem". Among the individuals whom he fictionalized were <b>successive</b> love <b>interests</b> Elena Haliță ("Marta Domșa") and Ilona Lászlo ("Ilona Vidor", daughter of Făget's mayor in real life, but of a gravedigger in the book), as well as General Karg, who issued the death sentence.

40|$|From 1989 to 1994 {{a series}} of papers {{outlined}} evidence for a brief episode of climate change from arid to humid, {{and then back to}} arid, during the Carnian Stage of the late Triassic Epoch. This time of climate change was compared to marine and terrestrial biotic changes, mainly extinction and then radiation of flora and fauna. Subsequently termed, albeit incorrectly, the Carnian Pluvial Event (CPE) by <b>successive</b> authors, <b>interest</b> in this episode of climatic change has increased steadily, with new evidence being published as well as several challenges to the theory. The exact nature of this humid episode, whether reflecting widespread precipitation or more local effects, as well as its ultimate cause, remains equivocal. Bed-by-bed sampling of the Carnian in the Southern Alps (Dolomites) shows the episode began with a negative carbon isotope excursion that lasted for only part of one ammonoid zone (A. austriacum). However, that the Carnian Humid Episode represents a significantly longer period, both environmentally and biotically, is irrefutable. The evidence is strongest in the European, Middle Eastern, Himalayan, North American and Japanese successions, but not always so clear in South America, Antarctica and Australia. The eruption of the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province and global warming (causing increased evaporation in the Tethyan and Panthalassic oceans) are suggested as causes for the humid episode...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStereo {{matching}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} topics in computer vision. It consists to find in two images of a same scene, taken from different viewpoints, the pairs of pixels which are the projections of a same scene point. Since the last twenty years, many local and global methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Such stereo configurations reduce the search for correspondences from two-dimensions (the entire image) to one-dimension; the epipolar constraint can be used to facilitate matching by reducing the search. The application area of the matching problem is very wide, including biological sequences, the comparison of different files, speech recognition. In this paper, we will present a new probabilistic approach method based on Markov process for the matching of two epipolar images; where each scan-line is delimited by two <b>successive</b> points of <b>interest...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sovereignty {{ought to}} remain perpetually in {{the will of}} the people. However, the {{contract}} to institute the sovereign state is illegitimate or unnecessary. There may be a practical necessity for a contract of union to bind the individuals to the common interest. The individual has, on this view, a common interest only as an associate. Likewise he has a general will for the common interest of the association. A detailed analysis of the main argument follows. Rousseau does not use "common interest" consistently. There is the permanent common interest, supposedly constant throughout the state's existence. The <b>successive</b> common <b>interest,</b> which is really comparable to a majority vote. Finally, there is the interest in the interests of all or the common good. This is, mainly, a moral sense. The Legislator provides artificially a moral education and creates a right tradition and social solidarity, instilling a regard for the common good. The general will represents the argument that there is a good for the state which the individuals do not know of. Rousseau advocates absolute sovereignty but, being a legislative function, it is limited by the nature of law. But a criterion of law is that the majority can make laws in accordance with their evaluation of the public utility. There are no individual rights, only sovereign rights, in this sense the general will is a moral sovereign. It is disinterested being the will for the good of all the citizens, not the sovereign will of the Kingdom of Ends. In contrast to Bosanquet it is an abstract universal; institutions, etc. are not objective embodiments of the general will. The general will is not one will, nor an analysis of a democratic state, but an ideal standard for popular sovereignty. <p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Asian {{economic}} crisis {{which began with}} the floating of the bhat by Thailand on July 1 1997 is still having devastating effects on the livelihood and the well being {{of millions of people}} {{in many parts of the}} world. The financial crisis spread from Thailand to other Asian countries, subsequently to Russia and more recently to Brazil. Fortunately, timely and decisive action by the US Federal Reserve last autumn (instituting three <b>successive</b> reductions in <b>interest</b> rates) has enabled advanced countries to escape the crisis so far. Nevertheless it is estimated by the World Bank that as a consequence of the crisis the rate of growth of world GDP is 2 percentage points lower both in 1998 and in 1999 than it would otherwise have been. A rough calculation shows that this amounts to a huge loss over these two years of $ 120 per capita in production or income for each man, woman and child in the world. This also suggests indirectly that hundreds of millions of people in poor countries who live on a dollar a day or less are likely to have become considerably poorer still as a result of the crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reconsiders the {{analysis}} of the socioprofessional dynamic {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century Geneva that we presented at the ASI 4 Conference. It complements the study with a supervised analysis of the dissimilarities between transitions. Data are two by two matches between 6 censuses. More specifically, we consider the socioprofessional group (SPG) of each considered individual and its change between two <b>successive</b> censuses. Our <b>interest</b> is in the types of transition (stable, becoming active, becoming inactive, [...] .) as well as in new comers (immigrants and births) and lost cases (emigrants and deaths). The statistical implicative analysis of our data gives an insightful image of the relationships between these dynamics and the concerned SPG, as well as with some demographic and cultural variables (sex, age, religion). It highlights for instance polarizations around key variables. The dissimilarity analysis permits to segment the population into homogeneous groups using demographic (age, sex, marital status) and cultural (religion) predictors. The interpretation relies on typical transitions identified for each group by means of the intensity of implication. By doing so, we get also the required elements for comparing the outcome with the results of the implicative graph...|$|R
40|$|With {{this article}} we intend to outline the story of American {{psychiatry}} starting {{at the end of}} the 19 th century until the present time, describing the cultural, political and economic context which culminated in the development and diffusion of biological psychiatry and its nosography. The diffusion of psychoanalysis and of A. Meyer’s psychological psychiatry, beginning {{at the end of the}} Second World War until the end of the Sixties, determined such as an enlargement of psychiatric diagnosis which no longer allowed one to distinguish a sane individual from an ill individual. This “dimensional” model caused a slow process of de-medicalization of psychiatry which removed consent and legitimacy from the discipline. The answer was the publication in 1980 of DSM III, the work of a small number of psychiatrists known as the “Neo-Kraepelinians”. The new nosography based on a categorial diagnostic system, emphasized what is directly observable and therefore measurable, and not what is clinically significant. Whit DSM III and the <b>successive</b> versions the <b>interest</b> of the psychiatrists moved from the clinical to the epidemiological research. In the attempt to take psychiatry back to one of the medical sciences DSM III has in reality continued the process of undermining started whit Meyer and psychoanalysis.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} war in Northern Uganda between the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the National Resistance Army/Movement (NRA/M) government. It {{specifically}} looks at Acholiland which has borne {{the brunt of the}} war by analyzing its causes and endurance despite the government’s control of state machinery. The thesis focuses on the role of ethnicity in the war since the rise of the government of President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni in 1986. The study points out that while political turbulence and wars have been part of Uganda’s politics since independence in 1962, the persistence of the LRA war is attributable to the mobilization and manipulation of ethnicity. In addition, the dominant reason for the continuation of the war is the perception among the Acholi people of exclusion and marginalization from meaningful political participation. The study contributes to the existing literature that links ethnicity and violence by showing that ethnicity is often not the problem, but that ethnic violence emanates from manipulation and politicization of ethnicity by leaders for selfish <b>interests.</b> <b>Successive</b> Ugandan leaders have sown the seeds of resentment that has led to ethnic violence by discriminating against some ethnic groups while favouring others. The thesis concludes that Uganda will not achieve stability until it instills the ethos of national integration and fair distribution of political and economic resource...|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to the free expression, the media can be both problem and solution, writes MARGARET SIMONS ?THE public interest. ? What do those words mean, {{particularly}} when used by media organisations in their own defence, or when lobbying governments for greater freedoms? The question occurs to me {{as a result of this}} entirely reasonable Australian Press Council adjudication, which forms part of the continuing controversies concerning the West Australian ? the wild, wild journal of the wild, wild west. The latest adjudication is a fairly simple case ? or so you would think. The West Australian got fundamental facts wrong in a story about the hospital system and refused to correct. As the Press Council says, ?The newspaper?s actions compromised its legitimate attempt to air a matter of obvious public concern. ? Inarguable, you would think, but that hasn?t stopped the West Australian lodging an appeal against the decision. Their defence? You guessed it ? writing stories about inadequate health services is in the ?public interest? and this means that the errors ?were immaterial to the issue. ? Oh, really? The West Australian must take the public for fools. The words ?the public interest,? used in this way, become weasel words, full of wind and self <b>interest.</b> <b>Successive</b> generations of media moguls have argued for freedom of the media because of the public interests involved. Our own time is no exception. Our leading media organisations earlier this year clubbed together to form Australia?s Right to Know, which has commissioned an independent audit of the state of media freedom in Australia. Admirable, but as the Australia Privacy Foundation has pointed out in its submission to the audit. The media are also heavily involved in commercial activity unrelated to any ?public interest? role, and much of their editorial output is in the area of ?infotainment? or pure entertainment, which can make few if any claims to special protection or privileges founded on a ?fourth estate? role. We also hope that the audit, and the Right to Know campaign, can avoid overly simplistic characterisation of the relationship between governments and the media? the relationship cannot be reduced to a simple story of good and brave journalists fighting repressive government censorship. Press and media interests have often enthusiastically cooperated with government efforts to mould public opinion and have often received benefits from doing so? an appropriate degree of humility, would be welcome. ? I hope the Privacy Foundation isn?t holding its breath waiting for the humility. Freedom of the media, so far as media corporations are concerned, means freedom for them to do as they wish. They are slower to defend the ability of individual journalists to write as they wish, let alone for the public to have direct access to the ability to publish. New media changes this. A thousand blogs bloom, and now just about anyone can say anything ? but this kind of freedom of speech has not been embraced by mainstream media. Rather, they rubbish it. Witness News Limited?s sensitivity to criticism in the blogosphere. Every editor would claim to want their publication talked about around the water cooler. But when those conversations happen in public, on the web, they hate it. The notional but safely invisible readers chatting around the water cooler are characterised as ?mainstream Australians? ? the nice friendly public whose right to know the media casts itself as defending. But bloggers! They are ?cannibals? on the mainstream media, academics, wankers and wannabes, and so forth and so on. The abuse is heaped on. Journalism academic Jay Rosen has pointed out that the famous part of the United States constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press was originally proposed, composed and codified to protect not the freedom of journalists to report, but the freedom of citizens to meet, speak, be informed and publish reports. When {{it comes to}} the citizen?s right to be heard, the media can be both problem and solution. Too often, I think the very media organisations who complain about lack of freedom of speech are the first to bully non-media participants in public life. The media are just one way of giving expression to freedom of speech ? vitally important, yes, but not the whole box and dice, and not an unqualified blessing. It?s hard to imagine that the West?s appeal against the Press Council decision can succeed. If it did, it would mean that any media organisation could raise any issue in the public realm, whether or not it gets its facts right, and get off scot free because of ?the public interest. ? But more important than this single case is that those who bang on about freedoms and public interests need to become a bit more careful about how they use the words. The concepts are too important to be used so shallowly. ? Margaret Simons?s new book, The Content Makers: Understanding the Media in Australia, is published by Penguin.
