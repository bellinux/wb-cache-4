40|$|Background: Phenylketonuria (PKU), {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{metabolic}} diseases that resulted in mental retardation. The study aimed to investigate the incidence of phenylketonuria in Lorestan province, Iran. Materials and Methods: The study was an observational-descriptive study which included all identified cases of patients from April 2006 to February 2016. The required data were collected from patients' records. The Entered variables in data survey checklist included gender, date of birth, County Residence, parental education, parental occupation, parental kinship, conducting genetic consultation and <b>screening.</b> <b>Recorded</b> <b>data</b> were analyzed in Stata- 12 software after completion. Results: Newborns were identified with Phenylketonuria during the years 2006 to 2016 and incidence rate calculated 1. 91 per 10, 000 live births. The highest incidence rate of disease was 3. 86 per 10, 000 live births in 2014. Delfan (Nurabad) County and Borujer County had maximum and minimum rate of incidence with 5. 94 per 10, 000 and 0. 64 per 10, 000, respectively. Among 74 patients, 42 (56 %), were female and there was patients' parental kinship in 82 % of parents that about 92 percent of suffering children parents had done genetic consultation. Conclusion: The incidence of phenylketonuria in the Lorestan province is more than other provinces. Given that most cases of patients resulted from cousin marriages, paying attention to the screening tests prior to marriage, particularly in familiar marriage is essential...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{empirical}} evaluation study of users' performance {{and satisfaction with}} prototype of Web Based speech photo annotation with speech interaction. Participants involved consist of Johor Bahru citizens from various background. They have completed two parts of annotation task; part A involving PhotoASys; photo annotation system with proposed speech interaction and part B involving Microsoft Microsoft Vista Speech Interaction style. They have completed eight tasks for each part including system login and selection of album and photos. Users' performance was <b>recorded</b> using computer <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> software. <b>Data</b> were captured on the task completion time and subjective satisfaction. Participants need to complete a questionnaire on the subjective satisfaction when the task was completed. The performance data show the comparison between proposed speech interaction and Microsoft Vista Speech interaction applied in photo annotation system, PhotoASys. On average, the reduction in annotation performance time due to using proposed speech interaction style was 64. 72 % rather than using speech interaction Microsoft Vista style. Data analysis were showed in different statistical significant in annotation performance and subjective satisfaction for both styles of interaction. These results {{could be used for}} the next design in related software which involves personal belonging management. Comment: IEEE Publication Format, [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Summary Background Little {{is known}} about the {{psychological}} effects of bariatric surgery. This review aimed to assess long term effectiveness of bariatric surgery on psychosocial quality of life (QoL) of obese adults compared to non-surgical interventions. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted, six electronic databases, plus other relevant sources were searched from inception to January 2014. The main outcome sought was a QoL measure with a minimum 12 months follow-up. Three reviewers <b>screened</b> <b>records,</b> extracted <b>data</b> and independently read through full articles for eligibility and quality using standardised forms. Findings were analysed using narrative synthesis. Results Of 4383 identified references included in the review, 11 studies showed bariatric surgery to be effective long term for overall QoL than non-surgical treatments with specifically modest benefits psychosocially. Significant improvements in psychosocial QoL alongside improved physical QoL were observed after 2 year follow-up post-surgery compared to non-surgical interventions. However improvements in psychosocial QoL after surgery at 10 year follow up were minimal when compared to non-surgical interventions. When compared to untreated control groups, long term psychosocial QoL did not improve after bariatric surgery despite major improvements in physical QoL, significant weight loss and co-morbidities. Conclusions Results on long term psychosocial QoL remain uncertain with some suggestion of psychological disorder persisting. This highlights need for psychological intervention post-surgery and further research to provide more data on long-term psychosocial QoL following bariatric surgery...|$|R
40|$|Guided tissue {{regeneration}} (GTR) with bioabsorbable collagen membranes (CM) {{is commonly}} used {{for the treatment of}} periodontal defects. The objective of this systematic review of randomized clinical trials was to assess the clinical efficacy of GTR procedures with CM, with or without bone substitutes, in periodontal infrabony defects compared with that of open flap debridement (OFD) alone. Primary outcomes were tooth loss and gain in clinical attachment level (CAL). <b>Screening</b> of <b>records,</b> <b>data</b> extraction, and risk-of-bias assessments were performed by two reviewers. Weighted mean differences were estimated by random effects meta-analysis. We included 21 reports on 17 trials. Risk of bias was generally high. No data were available for the primary outcome tooth loss. The summary treatment effect for change in CAL for GTR with CM compared with OFD was 1. 58 mm (95 % CI, 1. 27 to 1. 88). Despite large between-trial heterogeneity (I 2 = 75 %, p <. 001), all trials favored GTR over OFD. No differences in treatment effects were detected between trials of GTR with CM alone and trials of GTR with CM in combination with bone substitutes (p for interaction,. 31). GTR with CM, with or without substitutes, may result in improved clinical outcomes compared with those achieved with OFD alone. Our findings support GTR with CM for the treatment of infrabony periodontal defects...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} presents interim {{results of}} a larger empirical study which aims at determining and measuring the differences between novice and semi-professional levels of competence. The study attempts to model translation competence, in particular to predict the level of competence based on empirical process data about the distribution of visual attention, revisions {{and the use of}} reference materials. In the study, collocations, idioms, realia and the like are used as stimuli. This contribution focuses on the reading and comprehension of false friends in the language combination Italian-German. False friends {{serve as the basis for}} contrasting translation performance of novices and semi-professionals. The participants were native speakers of German (L 1), acquiring both language and translation competence in their L 2 almost simultaneously. A combination of research methods was applied to collect process data within a series of experiments conducted at the Faculty of Translation Studies, Linguistics and Cultural Studies of the University of Mainz: eye tracking, keystroke logging, retrospective interviews and <b>screen</b> <b>recording.</b> The collected <b>data</b> were evaluated quantitively as well as qualitatively and then triangulated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Distance {{learning}} service {{has become a}} more and more popular medium {{for the public to}} obtain knowledge. Through advances of broadband network and video compression technologies, conventional products in the distance-learning category can provide a real-time streaming broadcast of live contents or an on-demand streaming of archive contents. However, due to the low resolution of a video camera, images of the projected high-resolution computer screen in the video are usually blurred. This makes it difficult for remote participants to recognize most of the characters in the instructor’s operations only by looking at the video. Therefore, real-time <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> is proposed to record full motions on the computer screen for learning-supporting materials. Using conventional <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> system, an instructor may find it difficult to operate application programs smoothly. This {{is due to the fact}} that most of CPU utilization is taken up by the <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> routines. In this paper, we propose an effective application control, called "sporadic control (SC) " mechanism, to regulate the frequency of <b>screen</b> <b>recording</b> routines to protect the system and network from instantaneous heavy workload. From the experimental results, we show that the CPU utilization can be reduced by more than 15 %. This improvement is significant...|$|R
