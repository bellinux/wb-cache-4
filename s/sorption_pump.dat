50|$|Getter pump or <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> - In {{laboratory}} vacuum systems {{the bulk}} NEG getter is often {{held in a}} separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve, {{so that it can}} be replaced or renewed when saturated.|$|E
50|$|After {{filling a}} <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> with new {{molecular}} sieve it {{should always be}} regenerated as the new molecular sieve is probably saturated with water vapor. Also when a pump is not in use it should be closed off from the atmosphere to prevent water vapor saturation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sorption</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{a type of}} {{cryopump}} that {{is often}} used as roughing pumps to reduce pressures from the range of atmospheric to {{on the order of}} 0.1 Pa (10−3 Torr), while lower pressures are achieved using a finishing pump (see vacuum).|$|R

40|$|A {{system to}} perform turbomolecular drag foreline pumping and {{scattering}} chamber roughing {{was installed in}} the Surface Modification and Characterization Research Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The system consists of an oil-free mechanical scroll pump that can be connected to either a roughing manifold serving four scattering chambers or to a foreline ballast tank and manifold serving five turbomolecular drag pumps. A controller mediates {{the demands of the}} two manifolds, giving priority to the foreline. Due to the low leakage from the accelerator beamlines, the duty cycle in the foreline pumping mode consists of a few minutes of operating time every few days, greatly reducing wear on the scroll pump. Significant savings are realized due to reduced consumption of liquid nitrogen for <b>sorption</b> <b>pumping,</b> elimination of oil changes and repairs to individual mechanical foreline pumps, and lower electrical power consumption...|$|R
50|$|Cryopumps {{are often}} {{combined}} with sorption pumps by coating the cold head with highly adsorbing {{materials such as}} activated charcoal or a zeolite. As the sorbent saturates, {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> decreases, but can be recharged by heating the zeolite material (preferably under conditions of low pressure) to outgas it. The breakdown temperature of the zeolite material's porous structure may limit the maximum temperature that it may be heated to for regeneration.|$|E
50|$|An {{entrapment}} pump {{may be a}} cryopump, {{which uses}} cold temperatures to condense gases to a solid or adsorbed state, a chemical pump, which reacts with gases to produce a solid residue, or an ion pump, which uses strong electrical fields to ionize gases and propel the ions into a solid substrate. A cryomodule uses cryopumping. Other types are the <b>sorption</b> <b>pump,</b> non-evaporative getter pump, and titanium sublimation pump (a type of evaporative getter {{that can be used}} repeatedly).|$|E
50|$|A <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> {{is usually}} {{constructed}} in stainless steel, aluminium or borosilicate glass. It {{can be a}} simple Pyrex flask filled with molecular sieve or an elaborate metal construction consisting of a metal flask containing perforated tubing and heat-conducting fins. A pressure relief valve can be installed. The design only influences the pumping speed and not the ultimate pressure that can be reached. The design details are a trade-off between fast cooling using heat conducting fins and high gas conductance using perforated tubing.|$|E

50|$|Several {{types of}} pumps {{may be used}} in {{sequence}} or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 Torr, 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> would be used to bring the pressure down to 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). A cryopump or turbomolecular pump would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10−8 Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10−6 Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a cryopump or turbo pump, such as helium or hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a vacuum}} pump {{that creates a}} vacuum by adsorbing {{molecules}} on a very porous material like molecular sieve which is cooled by a cryogen, typically liquid nitrogen. The ultimate pressure is about 10−2 mbar. With special techniques this can be lowered till 10−7 mbar. The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation {{because there are no}} moving parts. The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump hydrogen, helium and neon, all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen. The main application is as a roughing pump for a sputter-ion pump in ultra-high vacuum experiments, for example in surface physics.|$|E

The components needed in a Mars propellant production plant {{have been developed to}} various levels of technology maturity, but there is little experience with the systems in a Mars environment. Two systems for the acquisition and compression of the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere were designed, assembled, and tested in a Mars environment chamber. A microchannel <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> system was able to raise the pressure from 7 Torr to 450 Torr or from 12 Torr to over 700 Torr in two stages. This data now provides information needed to make additional improvements in the <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> technology to increase performance, although a system-level analysis might prove that some amount of pre- or post-compression may be a preferred solution. A mini cryofreezer system was also evaluated as an alternative method for carbon dioxide acquisition and compression.

40|$|A dual {{refrigeration}} system for cooling a sink device is described, which automatically thermally couples the cold refrigerator {{to the sink}} device while thermally isolating the warm refrigerator from the sink device. The system includes two gas gap heat switches that each thermally couples one of the refrigerators to the sink device, {{and a pair of}} <b>sorption</b> <b>pumps</b> that are coupled through tubes to the heat switches. When the first refrigerator is operated and therefore cold, the first pump which is thermally coupled to it is also cooled and adsorbs gas to withdraw it from the second heat switch, to thereby thermally isolate the sink device from the warm second refrigerator. With the second refrigerator being warm, the second pump is also warm and desorbs gas, so the gas lies in the first switch, to close that switch and therefore thermally couple the cold first refrigerator to the sink device. Thus, the heat switches are automatically switched according to the temperature of the corresponding refrigerator...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{has been}} {{completed}} and initial experiments performed on a versatile new spheromak facility at Swarthmore College called the Swarthmore Spheromak Experiment (SSX). Establishment of the facility was made possible in part by start-up funds provided by DOE.

The 0. 6 m diameter, 1. 2 m long stainless steel vacuum chamber is evacuated with cryo and <b>sorption</b> <b>pumps</b> (purchased with DOE funds) in an effort to reduce wall contamination due to pump oil. Spheromaks are be formed and sustained by up to four 10 kV, 50 kJ capacitor modules (originally used on FRX-C and obtained through DOE).

40|$|We {{designed}} {{an experimental}} system {{capable of handling}} at least 100 Ci tritium in an experimental run: the amount {{is considered to be}} necessary for a variety of experiments aiming at investigating the physicochemical properties of tritium. As a first step, we fabricated one of its subsystems, tritium circulation subsystem, in order to examine pumping and out gassing characteristics of the subsystem as well as the potential of Zr-based alloys for the storage and recovery of about 1000 Ci of tritium. It has been observed that the combination of a mechanical roughing pump and <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> could evacuate the subsystem down to 1 x 10 - 6 Torr. It was suggested, however, that the adsorption and desorption of HTO on/from the inner wall of tritium systems would cause serious problems on safety and environmental aspects as well as pumping characteristics, requiring thus the development of surface coating layers to protect the wall from tritium adsorption and/or adsorption...|$|E
40|$|A tiny adiabatic-demagnetization {{refrigerator}} (T-ADR) {{has been}} developed for a commercial {{superconducting quantum interference device}} magnetometer [Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) from Quantum Design]. The whole T-ADR system is fit in a cylindrical space of the diameter 8. 5 mm and the length 250 mm, and can be inserted into the narrow sample tube of MPMS. A <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> is self-contained in T-ADR, and hence no complex gas handling system is necessary. With the single crystalline Gd_ 3 Ga_ 5 O_ 12 garnet (∼ 2 grams) used as a magnetic refrigerant, the routinely achievable lowest temperature is ∼ 0. 56 K. The lower detection limit for a magnetization anomaly is ∼ 1 × 10 ^- 7 emu, estimated from fluctuation of the measured magnetization. The background level is ∼ 5 × 10 ^- 5 emu below 2 K at H = 100 Oe, which is largely attributable to a contaminating paramagnetic signal from the magnetic refrigerant.

40|$|Improved complex-compound <b>sorption</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{undergoing}} development {{for use as}} prime movers in heat-pump systems for cooling and dehumidification of habitats for humans on the Moon and for residential and commercial cooling on Earth. Among the advantages of sorption heat-pump systems are that they contain no moving parts except for check valves {{and they can be}} driven by heat from diverse sources: examples include waste heat from generation of electric power, solar heat, or heat from combustion of natural gas. The use of complex compound sorbents in cooling cycles is not new in itself: Marketing of residential refrigerators using SrCl 2 was attempted in the 1920 s and 30 s and was abandoned because heat- and mass-transfer rates of the sorbents were too low. Addressing the issue that gave rise to the prior abandonment of complex compound <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pumps,</b> the primary accomplishment of the present development program thus far has been the characterization of many candidate sorption media, leading to large increases in achievable heat- and mass-transfer rates. In particular, two complex compounds (called "CC 260 - 1260 " and "CC 260 - 2000 ") were found to be capable of functioning over the temperature range of interest for the lunar-habitat application and to offer heat- and mass-transfer rates and a temperature-lift capability adequate for that application. Regarding the temperature range: A heat pump based on either of these compounds is capable of providing a 95 -K lift from a habitable temperature to a heat-rejection (radiator) temperature when driven by waste heat at an input temperature. 500 K. Regarding the heat- and mass-transfer rates or, more precisely, the power densities made possible by these rates: Power densities observed in tests were 0. 3 kilowatt of cooling per kilogram of sorbent and 2 kilowatts of heating per kilogram of sorbent. A prototype 1 -kilowatt heat pump based on CC 260 - 2000 has been built and demonstrated to function successfully...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} of a monovalent air-to-water {{absorption heat pump}} is developed with a heating capacity rating of 25 kW for residential heating systems. The ambient air supplies the external enrgy, and the driving energy comes from a two-stage adjustable oil burner. As {{the temperature of the}} outside air rises, residential heating requirements drop, but the output heat of the heat pump remains constant. Therefore heat pumps have to turn on and off in fixed- cycles. The intermittent losses caused by the fixed-cycle operation of conventional absorption heat pumps have been avoided by a new, patented operating method. This makes this absorption heat pump particularly suitable for use in residential heating systems. Based on this system we developed a procedure that makes a controllable cycle possible for a <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pump,</b> which is suited to actual heating requirements without fixed-cycles. The significant improvement is the possibility of year-round operation in heat pump modem whereby ambient heat can be fed to the evaporator even when the outside air temperatures are below - 3 C and the <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> can operate at his optimal COP. This will be achieved by the control of the concentration of the ammonia-water solution and by theadjustment of an infinetely variable burner...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA gas-gap heat switch (GGHS) {{reaches its}} highest {{conductance}} state when {{the gap between}} two exchange surfaces is filled with a conducting gas in a viscous regime. The broader the surface and the thinner the gap, the higher the ON conductance achieved. In this paper we describe a very thin cold gas-gap heat switchreached upon {{the use of the}} differential thermal expansion of the construction materials. Such technique overcomes the intricacies of the manufacturing process of the switch. We designed built and tested a prototype of a very thin gap heat switch using our new methodology. The high conductance was measured with both helium and nitrogen, at temperatures ranging from 20  K (He) or 75  K (N 2) up to room temperature. The inferred gap opening at low temperature (≈  17  μm) has shown to be slightly above the expected, which allowed us to reinterpret the design calculations. The switch was also characterized along its extreme conductance states while using a <b>sorption</b> <b>pump,</b> and its performance was compared with a previously developed model. Lessons learned from the first prototype led us to build a second one with better performance. Our experiments suggest that the proposed design allows {{for the development of a}} customized cryogenic switch with improved ON conductance while keeping the assembly very simple and sturdy, hence widening the scope of applicability of these devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{cryogenic}} {{measurement system}} capable of performing on-wafer RF testing of semiconductor devices and circuits has been developed.

The system operates under vacuum created by a <b>sorption</b> <b>pump.</b> It uses an open cycle cooling system that can be cooled with either liquid nitrogen or liquid helium. Presently, it can reach temperatures, as low as 80 K and 37 K for each of the coolants, respectively. The temperature can be raised using a heater and it is stabilized to within 0. 2 K by use of a temperature controller. The CryoProbe Station features a 1 by 2 inch stage that can hold large circuits and calibration standards simultaneously. The system is used with a Hewlett Packard 8510 C Automatic Network Analyzer (ANA) to obtain S-parameter data over the frequency range 0. 045 - 26. 5 GHz. S-parameter data on HEMT (high electron mobility transistors) devices has been obtained with this station. With the use of DEEMBED software from NIST, detailed transmission line studies have been performed. Although the CryoProbe Station is designed for frequencies up to 26. 5 GHz, useful transmission line data has been obtained for frequencies as high as 40 GHz.

40|$|Gas-driven <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> (GDSHP) show {{significant}} {{potential to}} reduce primary energy use, associated emissions and energy costs for space heating and {{domestic hot water}} (DHW) production in residential applications. In this study a bivalent system was considered, characterised by the integration of a novel modular <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> component and a condensing boiler. The modular heat <b>pump</b> component, or <b>sorption</b> module (SM), has been developed in two types: Type A and Type B, either {{of which could be}} integrated into a bivalent GDSHP system. The Type A sorption module had a functioning principle based on a solid chemisorption cycle, while Type B operates under a resorption cycle. To investigate the applicability of each SM type, a bivalent GDSHP system with a Type A SM (GDSHPA) and one with a Type B SM (GDSHPB) were evaluated. Simulations of year-round space heating loads for two single family houses, one in New York and the other Minnesota, were carried out and the seasonal gas coefficient of performance (SGCOP) for each GDSHP system calculated. The impact of the ratio of the design heating capacity of the SM compared to the peak heating capacity of the bivalent GDSHP was studied. Results show that SGCOP was not significantly affected for SM design heating capacity ratios greater than 66 % of the peak GDSHPA design capacity in Minnesota, and 21 % for GDSHPB.

40|$|Heat {{switches}} {{are important}} devices in many cryogenic setups, especially in space applications and many {{systems have been}} used to allow a good ability to make or break a thermal contact. Among them, the so-called gas gap heat switches, in which the pressure is managed thanks to a small cryopump, are known to be very reliable and simple, principally due to the nonexistence of moving parts. However, in such switches, the gas characteristics and its adsorption properties have {{to be taken into account}} to determine their functioning temperature ranges. In this article, a gas gap heat switch, with a charcoal adsorption pump, tested with neon and hydrogen as conducting gas is described. The experimental results are presented and compared with calculation from a simple thermal model. Avoiding the gas condensation, limiting the OFF conductance and reaching a vis-cous regime in the ON state lead to an operational temperature window for the <b>sorption</b> <b>pump</b> that depends of the amount of gas. For neon, the minimum temperature to actuate our switch ranges from 17 K to 40 K; for hydro-gen, this temperature range goes from 9. 5 K up to 55 K. Such switches offer an extension to the well-studied helium gas gap heat switch which is limited to temperatures up to 15 K. Measured values for the thermal ON conductance (74 mW/K at 20 K for neon, 110 mW/K at 11 K for H 2) compare very well with the results expected from gas conductivity properties found in literature. For neon an ON/OFF conductance ratio about 220 is obtained at 20 K, whereas, for H 2, a ratio up around 440 was measured at 11 K...|$|E

A layout of the maser and detail drawings of the physics package was completed during the first 7 months of the contract. A computer model was made for the maser's thermal design. Using numerical computations, heater resistances were established for 7 temperature controlled zones. The physics package includes: a vacuum manifold that houses four <b>sorption</b> <b>pumps</b> capable of scavenging hydrogen for 4 years, a titanium vacuum tank housing the cavity, metallic seals for all vacuum joints, an RF dissociator within the vacuum envelope, a two-layer printed circuit solenoid and four layers of moly-permalloy magnetic shields.

After completion of the fabrication of the maser's components, the maser was assembled using these parts and other components made available by SAO, NRL, and NASA from earlier development work. In March, 1990, the vacuum system was assembled, and by May the maser assembly was completed. The magnetic shielding was poor and the shields were removed, reannealed by a local vendor, and the maser was reassembled. The maser began tests in early June and has been oscillating since that time. The test results of the maser are very good and a life test of the maser is being conducted.

To observe electronic properties of graphene-admolecules system, we applied {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} technique in a broad temperature range for graphene oxides as a good basis for understanding the electrotransport properties of other active carbons. Applied technique allowed observation of possible metal-insulator transition and <b>sorption</b> <b>pumping</b> effect as well as discussion of results {{in relation to the}} granular metal model. The electronic and transport properties are calculated {{within the framework of the}} tight-binding model along with the Kubo-Greenwood quantum-mechanical formalism. Depending on electron density and type of the sites, the conductivity for correlated and ordered adsorbates is found to be enhanced in dozens of times as compared to the cases of their random distribution. In case of the uniaxially strained graphene, the presence of point defects counteracts against or contributes to the band-gap opening according to their configurations. The band-gap behaviour is found to be nonmonotonic with strain in case of a simultaneous action of defect ordering and zigzag deformation. The amount of localized charge carriers (spins) is found to be correlated with the content of adsorbed centres responsible for the formation of potential barriers and, in turn, for the localization effects. Physical and chemical states of graphene edges, especially at a uniaxial strain along one of them, play a crucial role in electrical transport phenomena in graphene-based materials.

These heat pumps may be driven by solar energy, natural gas, biogas, geothermal energy or waste heat. Given that a plethora of heat sources and sorption materials can be exploited for different applications, various <b>sorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> modules have been developed. The sorption modules are pre-engineered sorption components for increased ease of sorption system development, improved cost effectiveness and reduced system complexity for various applications. However, {{in the design of}} sorption modules, component and system modelling and simulation are useful in the process of determining the optimal candidate of several possible sorption working couples for a given application. A test platform has been developed and a test methodology devised for the rapid characterisation of the transient behaviour of the sorption modules. The testing apparatus was used to derive various model parameters to be used for validation of a dynamic sorption module component model. The test method was analogous to that employed for dynamic testing and performance modelling of electrochemical accumulators (i. e. electric batteries) given the similarities between them and sorption modules (also known as thermochemical accumulators). The model parameter identification was based on various heating and cooling power performance parameters as a function of state of charge (SoC) of the sorption modules. A 7 -step procedure was used to characterise the performance of the sorption modules based on experimental data. A reference performance for charge and discharge of the sorption modules was measured followed by several measurements at ‘off-reference’ conditions. Performance curves for ‘off-reference’ conditions were then correlated to reference conditions to generate performance curves that describe the transient cooling and heating power delivery of the sorption module at any point within the test range. Results showed that the discharge performance of the sorption modules could be predicted within a reasonable margin of error with a test run sequence of 39 cycles...|$|R
