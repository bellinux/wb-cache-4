60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> on they rushed, the ever-freshening gale {{on their}} beam.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{replied that}} doubtless the symbol {{had come down}} to them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{commenced}} to dry {{her eyes}} with a little lace handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing but blank paper! Is {{this your}} writing in pencil on the envelope?' <b>She</b> <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> {{he gives the}} matter further consideration.|$|R
6000|$|Hippona lets no silly flush [...] Disturb her cheek, nought {{makes her}} blush. [...] Whate'er obscenities you say, [...] <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> titters frank and gay. [...] Oh Shame, awake one honest flush [...] For this,--that nothing makes her blush.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly <b>and</b> turned away. Douglas {{took the}} lamp {{and hurried to}} the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and,</b> going forward, {{threw open}} a door, {{inviting}} him to enter.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> they {{replaced}} the others. Then she touched {{him on the}} arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{they sat}} there in silence for several moments. Bellamy was {{thinking}} deeply.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> understandingly, <b>and</b> passed out. Laverick {{closed the}} door and came up to the bedside.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> brightly, <b>and</b> Lady Thurwell {{smiled as}} the horses started forward, and the {{carriage}} drove away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly <b>and</b> {{took her}} leave. Clara threw {{herself into a}} chair and rang the bell.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{without further}} {{question}} {{he made his}} way upstairs to the Italian's chamber.|$|E
60|$|Ray said {{something}} to her which I could not hear. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> left us together.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> left him. He made {{no attempt}} to follow--he felt no {{suspicion}} that she was deceiving him.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy saw at {{once that}} this was true, so <b>she</b> only <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> went on eating her bread.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> smilingly <b>and</b> {{left the}} room, while the maid Twinkle led Dot {{up the stairs}} and along the hallway to her room.|$|R
6000|$|Dame Fairy <b>she</b> <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> cries {{clear and}} sweet, [...] "'Tis a very good-e'en, sir, when such folks meet. [...] I know thee, Sam, thou though wist not of me, [...] And I'm come in late gloaming {{to speak with}} thee; [...] Though my eyes do dazzle at glint of your rush, [...] All under this pretty green fuchsia bush." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled and}} was very busy about {{purchasing}} boric acid. He stared after her, and slipped away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> choked, {{unable to}} speak, {{and started to}} move toward her car which was coming to a stop.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{left the}} room, with an insolent little glance at Jacob. The latter {{leaned back in}} his chair.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> approval, <b>and</b> said, [...] "If we {{find one}} head we'll burn the village. Hey, you, Charley! What fella place head he stop?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly, <b>and</b> {{the doctor}} {{followed}} his host into the dining-room {{and took his}} {{seat at the table}} where the dessert still remained.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> quickly, <b>and</b> {{was gone}} in-doors {{while he was}} yet {{struggling}} with his doubt {{of the reality of}} what had all so swiftly happened.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> was gone. Her {{rippling}} laugh, {{with its}} harsh, ironical ring was heard echoing down the village street.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> I {{led the way}} upstairs. I {{opened the}} door and closed it again softly, leaving them alone....|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{made her}} adieux to the Prince. The two men stood {{together}} {{and watched her}} depart with her companion.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> affirmation, <b>and</b> I {{could have}} struck {{her in the}} face for her folly. I drew aside, and as she moved slowly on she murmured: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{gave the}} promise. <b>She</b> smiled, <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> left him. True to his instructions, Mr. Rayburn {{reckoned}} five minutes by his watch, before he followed her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> 'Yes,' <b>and</b> went to {{the door}} to listen for his coming up, that she might meet him on the stairs. But, as he was not there, she came back again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{lifted her}} face; {{he felt her}} hot soft lips on his forehead, and went away a little comforted.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> passed on. Her {{farewell}} to Lady Ruth was distinctly curt. Wingrave resumed {{his seat and}} his luncheon without remark.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{this time}} Smoke's {{laughter}} rang out clear and true. It was the spontaneous laughter of a frankly beaten man.|$|E
6000|$|So {{intent was}} Mombi on the treasures she had gained {{that when she}} turned the bend in the road and {{caught a glimpse of}} the man, <b>she</b> merely <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> {{her head}} <b>and</b> {{looked at him}} askance, as though {{astonished}} {{that he should have}} aught to say.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> without speaking, <b>and</b> Gonzaga {{opened the}} door, and called Fortemani. A voice {{answered}} {{him from the}} gloom of the banqueting-hall.|$|R
