5000|$|Zipp has {{introduced}} the [...] "customized" [...] ZEDTECH wheel line in 2007. Users {{can choose from}} an array of colors for decals, <b>spoke</b> <b>nipples,</b> and hub end caps. All ZEDTECH wheels now include aerodynamic dimpled hubs with ceramic bearings. Also in 2007, a new 808 track wheel was introduced with 20/24 spoke pattern and the 343 wheel set (303F + 404R).|$|E
50|$|The 2012 200s {{received}} a completely revamped frame, a new, lighter, cast aluminum swing arm, a new 7 mm longer PDS rear shock with adjustable rebound and compression settings, the latest WP forks {{with a wider}} adjustment range and new settings. The new wheels have CNC-machined hubs, Excel brand rims, zinc/nickel-coated spokes and aluminum <b>spoke</b> <b>nipples.</b> The new bodywork has a slimmer seat, a longer rear fender and a translucent fuel tank. There is a newly redesigned kick-starter. A redesigned air box and filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools and a flow-optimised intake flange is between the airbox and the carburetor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spoke</b> <b>nipples</b> are {{typically}} T-shaped in cross section, with an internal thread running {{part of the}} way through the hole that runs along the spoke nipple's principal axis. A spoke nipple rests in a hole drilled radially through the wheel's rim, and the nipple is threaded onto the external thread of a spoke. The spoke itself is fixed, at its other end, {{through a hole in the}} hub. The spoke and nipple are functionally equivalent to a bolt and a nut. However, unlike a typical nut-and-bolt pair, a spoke and nipple do not join two parts (the rim and the hub) so much as bridge them, under tension.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple</b> holds {{a bicycle}} wheel's rim to each spoke.|$|R
50|$|Wheelbuilding is {{the process}} of {{assembling}} wire wheels (generally a bicycle wheel, but including wheelchairs, and some cars). The components of a wire wheel are the rim, <b>spokes,</b> <b>nipples,</b> and hub.|$|R
5000|$|The {{torque moment}} must be {{transmitted}} to the tyre through the wheel components: flanges, <b>spokes,</b> <b>nipples,</b> and rim <b>spoke</b> bed. An engineered disc brake would reduce weight by not having most of the metal rim components ...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that wheels rotate as well as {{translate}} (move in a straight line) when a bicycle moves, more force is required to accelerate a unit of mass on the wheel than on the frame. To accelerate a wheel, total wheel mass matters less than the moment of inertia, which describes the inertial effect of the mass resisting acceleration (inertia) based on its location with respect to the axis of rotation (the center of the wheel hub/axle). In wheel design, reducing the rotational inertia has the benefit of more responsive, faster-accelerating wheels. To accomplish this, wheel designs are employing lighter rim materials, moving the <b>spoke</b> <b>nipples</b> to the hub or using lighter nipples such as aluminum. Note however that rotational inertia is only a factor during acceleration (and deceleration/braking). At constant speed, aerodynamics are a significant factor. For climbing, total mass remains important. See Bicycle performance for more detail.|$|E
5000|$|Mavic {{designed}} a <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple</b> {{mounted on the}} inside of the rim rather than from the tire side. This allows a rim to remain unpierced on the tire side with the exception of the valve hole. Less material is used in the rim. The Ksyrium wheelset was the first road to utilise this [...] "fore" [...] feature.|$|R
50|$|A {{spoke wrench}} or spoke key {{is a small}} wrench or tool used to adjust {{the tension in the}} spokes of a bicycle wheel, sulky wheel, {{wheelchair}} wheel, or similar wheel. A spoke wrench is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple</b> - not the spoke - that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.|$|R
5000|$|Constructing a tension-spoked wheel {{from its}} {{constituent}} parts is called wheelbuilding and requires the correct building procedure {{for a strong}} and long-lasting end product. Tensioned spokes are usually attached to the rim or sometimes the hub with a <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple.</b> The other end is commonly peened into a disk or uncommonly bent into a [...] "Z" [...] {{to keep it from}} pulling through its hole in the hub. The bent version has the advantage of replacing a broken spoke in a rear bicycle wheel without having to remove the rear gears.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple</b> is a headed {{cylinder}} with threading on {{the inside}} through part of its length (there is an unthreaded lead-in nearest the [...] "flats"). Traditionally, the nipples fit in holes in the rim, so {{that the head of}} the nipple is on the outermost part of the rim, while {{the other end of the}} nipple points inwards towards the hub. Many different types of nipples are now available, including internal nipples that sit entirely within the rim and can only be adjusted by removing the tire, as well as externally threaded nipples that thread into the rim (such as those used by Mavic Ksyriums). The threading grasps the spoke, so turning it increases or decreases tension in the spoke and influences the position of the hub relative to the rim.|$|R
5000|$|Since <b>spoke</b> {{threading}} and <b>nipple</b> threading must match, {{boxes of}} spokes usually include a like number of nipples. Weight savings or {{the need for}} great strength due to building a wheel with few spokes might call for obtaining different nipples than those shipped with the spokes. Standard materials for nipples are brass (usually nickel-plated) and aluminum. Brass is heavier but more durable and less prone to corrosion, rounding of flats while tightening, breaking and galling; aluminum is far lighter. If using aluminum <b>nipples,</b> the <b>spokes</b> should be long enough to engage {{the full length of}} <b>spoke</b> <b>nipple</b> threads so that the load is carried from spoke {{to the top of the}} nipple. [...] If the spoke is only part way into the nipple, the nipple carries the tension load and is prone to breaking from fatigue failure. Also, with aluminum nipples care and a good spoke wrench are needed to avoid rounding the flats while tightening. Recently, titanium nipples have become available from both US and Chinese sources. Proponents of titanium nipples suggest that they combine the advantages of brass and aluminum nipples (strength and weight, respectively), while being more corrosion resistant than either material.|$|R
50|$|At {{one end of}} each spoke is a {{specialized}} nut, called a nipple, {{which is used to}} connect the spoke to the rim and adjust the tension in the <b>spoke.</b> The <b>nipple</b> is usually located at the rim end of the spoke but on some wheels is at the hub end to move its weight closer to the axis of the wheel, reducing the moment of inertia.|$|R
50|$|Finally, for best, {{long-lasting}} results, spoke wind-up {{should be}} minimized. When a nipple turns, it twists the spoke at first, {{until there is}} enough torsional stress in the spoke to overcome the friction in the threads between the <b>spoke</b> and the <b>nipple.</b> This is easiest to see with bladed or ovalized spokes, but occurs in round spokes as well. If a wheel is ridden with this torsional stress left in the spokes, they may untwist and cause the wheel to become out of true. Bladed and ovalized spokes may be held straight with an appropriate tool as the nipple is turned. The common practice for minimizing wind-up in round spokes is to turn the nipple past the desired orientation by about a quarter turn, and then turn it back that quarter turn.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, <b>spokes</b> and <b>nipples,</b> drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R
