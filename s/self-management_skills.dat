40|$|Adolescents with {{a chronic}} disorder, such as haemophilia, need to attain {{responsibility}} for their disease. The aim was to gain insight into how adolescents achieve self-management of prophylactic treatment. In three Dutch Haemophilia Treatment Centres, adolescents (10 - 25 years) received structured questions on treatment responsibility and self-management (pre-specified definitions) during routine nursing consultation. In total, 155 interviews were performed in 100 patients (median age 14. 4 years). Self-infusion was initiated at a median age of 12. 3 years (IQR 11. 5 - 13. 0) and self-management was achieved 9. 6 years later, at a median age of 22. 6 years. This process included three phases coinciding with known stages of adolescence. In early adolescence, patients acquired the technique of self-infusion (12. 3 years) leading to independent self-infusion in middle adolescence (17. 2 years). In late adolescence, patients demonstrated an increase in more complex skills, such as bleeding management and communication with the haemophilia physician (19. 9 - 22. 6 years). Although, the first steps in self-management with regard to self-infusion are taken in early adolescence, complete self-management was achieved in late adolescence after almost 10 years. Insight in this transitional process helps to provide individualized support and emphasizes the need for continued education with regard to <b>self-management</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Patient Communication with {{healthcare}} professionals {{is an integral}} <b>self-management</b> <b>skill.</b> Yet the underlying mechanisms explaining how such communication might be enhanced across time have not been well studied. Objectives: Based on the transtheoretical model, the study aimed to develop an across-time Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy model in order to explain changes in participants' patient-professional communication behaviors in the Chronic Disease Self-management Program (CDSMP). Readiness-to-change construct was hypothesized to be the overall predictors of psychological and behavioral parameters. It was hypothesized that social norm and attitude toward behaviors would be the indirect predictors of communication behavior. Methods: One hundred and thirty-six Chinese participants with chronic diseases underwent a 6 -week CDSMP. Their attitude toward behavior, self-efficacy, social norm, readiness to change and communication behavior were obtained at 1 st, 4 th and 6 th week of the structured program. Results: A modified latent growth change curve model yielded satisfactory model fit (χ 2 /df= 1. 32; RMSEA= 0. 063 (90 % CI= 0. 018 - 0. 96)). The results showed that readiness to change had {{a positive influence on}} attitude and self-efficacy. Both attitude and social norm positively affected self-efficacy. Attitude and self-efficacy in turn positively influenced communication behavior {{at the beginning of the}} program. Across 6 weeks, self-efficacy imposed a negative influence on communication behavior while social norm exerted a positive influence on the behavior. Conclusion: This study revealed possible underlying mechanisms influencing CDSMP participants' communication with professionals. The results could shed light on further improvement of the structured program. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

However, students are not entitled to transport if they live within 3.2 km of the school for primary school students (ages 5-12) or within 4.8 km of the school for secondary school students (ages 13-18). Students are also not eligible if there are suitable public transport services between the school and the student's residence, ruling out free transport in most cities.Free school busing is a fast-diminishing phenomenon in New Zealand. It has historically favored rural students. As population migration trends internal to New Zealand have favored the growth of cities, it is an increasingly smaller minority of students who are served by school buses. Parents, acting as chauffeurs, are filling this gap, with multiple negative consequences (e.g., productivity losses for the New Zealand workforce, increased vehicular traffic interfering with commercial or industrial traffic well into the work-day, increased carbon footprint, diminished development of transport <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> in early teenagers, dangerous concentrations of hectic motoring near congested school entrances at school start-times, etc.). The matter occasionally surfaces in the New Zealand media, but making free school busing the norm is usually dismissed as another example of American-style thinking.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{sets out}} to report on {{research}} that investigated hospitality managers' expectations of graduate skills and compared those expectations with student perceptions of what hospitality managers value. Design/methodology/approach - The research adopted a generic skills framework and data were collected through a sample survey of 850 Australian hospitality managers and 211 undergraduate hospitality management students. Findings - Managers rated skills associated with interpersonal, problem solving, and <b>self-management</b> <b>skill</b> domains as most important while students appeared to have realistic perceptions of the skills that managers value when recruiting hospitality graduates. The most substantial areas of disagreement came in those skills associated with the conceptual and analytical domain. Industry managers tended to discount the skills in this domain relative to students. Research limitations/implications - The sample of managers {{used in this study}} were predominantly of Australian nationality and, in an increasingly global hospitality labor market, there may be some benefit in repeating this study with managers from different cultural backgrounds. Practical implications - A number of strategies are proposed in the paper for bridging the expectation gaps and ensuring better learning outcomes for students and industry stakeholders. Originality/value - In adopting the generic skills framework this research presents an alternative to previous studies that have used a management competencies framework. As such, it is of more immediate value to those responsible for designing undergraduate hospitality management curriculum who need to ensure that programs meet academic standards as well as industry and student expectations regarding the skill sets needed in the workplace.

The majority of studies in this area have focused on impairment, and research on skills and processes that allow physicians and resident physicians to achieve and maintain adequate levels of well-being has been limited. As such, the purpose of the present study was to adopt a positive psychology approach to investigate well-being as more than the presence or absence of dysfunction. It aimed to examine the link between self-regulation capacity, an important <b>self-management</b> <b>skill,</b> and psychological and affective well-being among physicians and resident physicians. Methods A total of 132 Canadian physicians and resident physicians completed online questionnaires assessing their levels of psychological and affective well-being and self-regulation capacity in order to determine if there were significant differences in well-being between physicians and resident physicians with high and low self-regulation capacity. Results Physicians and resident physicians had moderate and high levels of self-regulation capacity, respectively. While both groups were generally high in psychological well-being, they had average levels of positive and negative affect. Between-subject MANOVAs confirmed the hypothesis that high self-regulating physicians and resident physicians have higher levels of psychological well-being and positive affect compared to those with lower levels. However, those higher in self-regulation capacity did not have lower negative affect, nor did physicians have significantly higher levels of psychological and affective well-being than resident physicians. Conclusions Results do not support some of the literature suggesting that physicians are highly distressed and cannot manage the demands of their profession. The positive significant association between the physicians and resident physicians' self-regulation capacity and well-being implies that nurturing self-regulation skills within this population could potentially be one way to help them adapt to meet the evolving demands of the medical profession...|$|R

One type of maladaptive behaviour is uncontrollable worry, which is the defining feature of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study examined whether <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> relate to GAD symptoms and inaccurate beliefs about worry. The study also examined the role {{of positive and negative}} beliefs about worry in GAD. Finally, it explored whether a self-management intervention could alleviate distress caused by worry, and if the effectiveness varied as a function of an individual's pre-existing <b>self-management</b> <b>skills.</b> One hundred and fifty-nine participants completed questionnaires on <b>self-management</b> <b>skills,</b> beliefs about worry, and GAD symptoms. One hundred and twenty-six participants returned to complete a worry-induction, and either a self-management intervention or control condition. Self-evaluation skills were found to be negatively correlated with GAD symptoms and the negative belief that worry is uncontrollable and dangerous. Further, the belief that worry is uncontrollable and dangerous was a unique predictor of GAD symptoms. With poorly developed self-evaluating skills, individuals {{may be more likely to}} believe that worry is dangerous, which leads to more GAD symptoms. The self-management intervention was found to be more effective than the passage of time in removing negative affect and anxiety, and increasing positive affect. Participants with well developed <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> who used their skills had the greatest decreases in negative affect, while participants who had less developed <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> and did not use their skills had the smallest decreases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design study was to {{determine}} if providing diabetes supplies and diabetes self-management education to uninsured or underinsured diabetics improved health outcomes. Health outcomes included diabetes <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> and serum fructosamine. <b>Self-management</b> <b>skills</b> were measured with a Likert scale. Serum fructosamine was measured with a capillary blood sample analyzed in the Duet™ Glucose monitor. The study used a convenience sample of uninsured or underinsured Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics with serum fructosamine levels greater than 310 umol/liter. The sample size of twenty was determined by power analysis. Twenty-five participants were enrolled from May 1999 through May 2000, and twenty completed the study. The setting was a nonprofit community agency in a large southern metropolitan area. Participants met individually with the researcher every two weeks for four sessions. A fifth session was held one month after session four. At each session a module of the "I'm in Control" diabetes education program (Oklahoma State Department of Health, 1997) was reviewed, and participants were given insulin and diabetic supplies. Data were collected at the first and fifth session. A dependent! test (one-tailed, a=. 05) was used to compare the means of the pretest-posttest serum fructosamine levels. Data analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the pretest-posttest scores(!= - 4. 199, df= 19, 12 =. 000). Scores decreased an average of 95 umol/liter. The first hypothesis (At-risk persons with diabetes will have lower mean glucose levels following participation in a diabetes supply and diabetes self-management program.) was supported. The means of the pretest-posttest <b>self-management</b> <b>skills</b> inventory were analyzed with a dependent 1 test (one-tailed, a=. 05).

Two points stand out with regard to this prob-lem: First, presumably, most social skills curricula have not addressed suitably the problem of transfer of social and academic skills across campus settings (D. J. Smith, Nelson, Young, & West, 1992), and second, insufficient analysis has been done of conditions initiating and maintaining target behaviors per-formed by students with serious emo-tional disturbance (SED) as they per-form across diverse school settings (se...|$|R

Therefore, prevention programs that target youth either before or during junior high school may help prevent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use during high school. Life skills training (LST) is a school-based approach designed to prevent ATOD use among youth by influencing their knowledge and atti-tudes about ATODs, by teaching skills for resisting social pressures to use ATODs, and by helping students develop personal <b>self-management</b> and social <b>skills.</b> Researchers have studied this program’s effectiveness in preventing use of various substances among varied populations.

40|$|Encouraging {{self-management}} {{has been}} viewed as one means of reducing health service utilisation and contributing to improved demand management. However, the processes and imputed relationship between <b>self-management</b> education <b>skills</b> and health service contact are poorly understood. This paper reports on data from an embedded qualitative study which ran alongside a randomised controlled trial in England designed to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of a self-care support policy which found no statistically significant reductions in health service utilisation. Drawing on concepts from the sociology of chronic illness, analyses suggest that the biographical and social context relevant to individuals' experience of living with a long-term condition, history of health service utilisation, and relationships with health professionals are relevant to understanding the impact of self-management education and related policies aimed at bringing about changes in service use. Our study suggests that future health policy assumptions about utilisation {{in the context of}} chronic disease management and self-care support polices may benefit by acknowledging the complex, contextual and recursive nature of health service utilisation operating in the life worlds of patients' experience of living with a long-term condition.
