The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim {{to be able to}} communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.|$|E
25|$|In 1667 the Prince of Brandenburg, Frederick Wilhelm, {{ordered the}} {{immediate}} destruction of all <b>Sorbian</b> printed materials and banned saying masses in this language. At {{the same time}} the Evangelical Church supported printing <b>Sorbian</b> religious literature as a means of fighting the Counterreformation. In 1706 the <b>Sorbian</b> Seminary, the main centre for the education of <b>Sorbian</b> Catholic priests, was founded in Prague. Evangelical students of theology formed the <b>Sorbian</b> College of Ministers.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{relic of}} <b>Sorbian</b> {{literature}} originated in about 1530 – the Bautzen townsmen’s oath. In 1548 Mikołaj Jakubica – Lower <b>Sorbian</b> vicar, {{from the village}} called Lubanice, wrote the first unprinted translation of the New Testament into Lower <b>Sorbian.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1574 {{the first}} <b>Sorbian</b> book was printed: Albin Mollers’ songbook. In 1688 Jurij Hawštyn Swětlik {{translated}} the Bible for Catholic Sorbs. From 1706 to 1709 the New Testament was {{printed in the}} Upper <b>Sorbian</b> translation was done by Michał Frencel and in Lower <b>Sorbian</b> by Jan Bogumił Fabricius (1681–1741). Jan Bjedrich Fryco (a.k.a. Johann Friedrich Fritze) (1747–1819), translated the Old Testament {{for the first time}} into Lower <b>Sorbian,</b> published in 1790.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, mainly {{thanks to}} the Sorbs’ contribution, the most {{important}} <b>Sorbian</b> cultural centre (the <b>Sorbian</b> House) was built in Bautzen. In 1912, {{the social and cultural}} organization of Lusatian Sorbs was created, the Domowina Institution - the union of <b>Sorbian</b> organizations. In 1919 it had 180,000 members. In 1920 Jan Skala set up a <b>Sorbian</b> party and in 1925 in Berlin, Skala started Kulturwille- the newspaper for the protection of national minorities in Germany. In 1920 the Sokol Movement was founded (youth movement and gymnastic organization). From 1933 the Nazi party started to repress the Sorbs. At that time the Nazis also dissolved the Sokol Movement and began to combat every sign of <b>Sorbian</b> culture. In 1937 activities of the Domowina Institution and other organizations were banned as anti-national. <b>Sorbian</b> clergymen and teachers were forcedly deported from Lusatia; Nazi German authorities confiscated the <b>Sorbian</b> House, other buildings and crops.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} from Hoyerswerda to Schleife, a dialect of <b>Sorbian</b> which {{combines}} characteristic features of both Upper and Lower <b>Sorbian</b> is spoken. The region is predominantly Protestant, highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry, sparsely populated, and {{to a great extent}} germanicized. Most speakers of <b>Sorbian</b> are over 60 years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} statistics {{indicates the}} progression of cultural change among Sorbs: {{by the end of}} the 19th century, about 150,000 people spoke <b>Sorbian</b> languages. In 1920 almost all Sorbs mastered <b>Sorbian</b> and German to the same degree. Nowadays the number of people using <b>Sorbian</b> languages has been estimated to be no more than 40,000.|$|E
25|$|Catholic Lusatia {{encompasses}} 85 {{towns in}} the districts of Bautzen, Kamenz, and Hoyerswerda, where Upper <b>Sorbian</b> language, customs, and tradition are still thriving. In some of these places (e.g., Radibor or Radwor in <b>Sorbian,</b> Crostwitz or Chrósćicy, and Rosenthal or Róžant), Sorbs constitute {{the majority of the}} population, and children grow up speaking <b>Sorbian.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upper <b>Sorbian</b> (a Slavic language) {{is still}} {{actively}} spoken in {{the parts of}} Upper Lusatia that are inhabited by the <b>Sorbian</b> minority. The Germans in Upper Lusatia speak distinct dialects of their own (Lusatian dialects).|$|E
25|$|From 1842, {{the first}} <b>Sorbian</b> {{publishing}} companies started to appear: the poet Handrij Zejler {{set up a}} weekly magazine, the precursor of today’s Serbian News. In 1845 in Bautzen the first festival of <b>Sorbian</b> songs took place.|$|E
25|$|In 1809 for {{the short}} period of time, there was the first printed <b>Sorbian</b> newspaper. In 1767 Jurij Mjeń publishes the first secular <b>Sorbian</b> book. Between 1841 and 1843, Jan Arnošt Smoler and Leopold Haupt {{published}} two-volume collection of Wendish folk-songs in Upper and Lower Lusatia.|$|E
25|$|Upper Sorbs, {{who speak}} Upper <b>Sorbian</b> (about 40,000 people).|$|E
25|$|Lower Sorbs, {{who speak}} Lower <b>Sorbian</b> (about 20,000 people).|$|E
25|$|The first Lusatian {{cities were}} {{captured}} in April 1945, when the Red Army and the Polish Second Army crossed the river Queis (Kwisa). The defeat of Nazi Germany changed the Sorbs’ situation considerably: those {{to the east}} of Neisse and Oder were expelled or assimilated by Poland. The regions in East Germany (the German Democratic Republic) faced a large influx of expelled Germans and heavy industrialisation, which both forced Germanization. The East German authorities tried to counteract this development by creating a broad range of <b>Sorbian</b> institutions. The Sorbs were officially recognized as an ethnic minority, more than 100 <b>Sorbian</b> schools and several academic institutions were founded, the Domowina and its associated societies were re-established and a <b>Sorbian</b> theatre was created. Owing to the suppression of the church and forced collectivization, however, these efforts were severely affected and consequently over time the number of people speaking <b>Sorbian</b> languages decreased by half.|$|E
25|$|Bolesław I {{had taken}} control of the marches of Lusatia (Łużyce), <b>Sorbian</b> Meissen (Miśnia), and the cities of Budziszyn (Bautzen) and Meissen in 1002, and refused to pay the tribute to the Empire from the conquered territories. Bolesław, after the Polish-German War (1002–1018), signed the Peace of Bautzen on 30 January 1018, which made Bolesław I a clear winner. The Polish ruler {{was able to keep}} the contested marches of Lusatia and <b>Sorbian</b> Meissennot as fiefs, but as part of Polish territory. The Polish prince Mieszko {{destroyed}} a 100 <b>Sorbian</b> villages in 1030 and expelled them from urban areas, exception made of fisherman and carpenters, who were allowed to live in the outskirts.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>Sorbian</b> Bible translators include Jakub Buk (1825–1895), Michał Hórnik (Michael Hornig) (1833–1894), Jurij Łušćanski (a.k.a. Georg Wuschanski) (1839–1905).|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 2008, the <b>Sorbian</b> {{politician}} Stanislaw Tillich, {{member of}} the governing Christian Democrats, was elected as Minister President of the State of Saxony.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Jakub Bart-Ćišinski, {{the poet}} and classicist of Upper <b>Sorbian</b> literature, and Karol Arnošt Muka created a {{movement}} of young Sorbians influencing Lusatian art, science and literature for the following 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The Polabian {{language}} is now extinct. However, both <b>Sorbian</b> languages are spoken by approximately 60,000 {{inhabitants of the}} region and the languages are regarded by the government of Germany as official languages of the region.|$|E
25|$|The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, gave part of Upper Lusatia to Saxony, {{but most}} of Lusatia to Prussia. More and more bans {{on the use of}} <b>Sorbian</b> {{languages}} appeared from then until 1835 in Saxony and Prussia; emigration of the Sorbs, mainly to the town of Serbin in Texas and to Australia, increased. In 1848, 5000 Sorbs signed a petition to the Saxon Government, in which they demanded equality for the <b>Sorbian</b> language with the German one in churches, courts, schools and Government departments. From 1871 the whole of Lusatia became a part of united Germany and was divided between two parts; Prussia (Silesia and Brandenburg), and Saxony.|$|E
25|$|There are 60 towns {{from the}} area of Cottbus {{belonging}} to this region, {{where most of the}} older people over 60 but few young people and children can speak the Lower <b>Sorbian</b> language; the local variant often incorporates many words taken from the German language, and in conversations with the younger generation, German is generally preferred. Some primary schools in the region teach bilingually, and in Cottbus there is an important Gymnasium whose main medium of instruction is Lower <b>Sorbian.</b> The region is predominantly Protestant, again highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry. The biggest tourist attraction of the region and in the whole Lusatia are the marshlands, with many Spreewald/Błóta canals, picturesque broads of the Spree.|$|E
25|$|For over 1000 {{years the}} Sorbs {{were able to}} {{maintain}} and even develop their national culture, despite escalating Germanization and Polonization, mainly due to {{the high level of}} religious observance, cultivation of their tradition and strong families (<b>Sorbian</b> families still often have five children).|$|E
25|$|The Oder River forms {{a part of}} {{the eastern}} border, the Elbe River a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the Spree and the Havel. In the southeast, there is a {{wetlands}} region called the Spreewald; it is the northernmost part of Lusatia, where the Sorbs, a Slavic people, still live. These areas are bilingual, i.e., German and <b>Sorbian</b> are both used.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, many <b>Sorbian</b> émigrés {{travelled}} to Australia, {{along with}} many ethnic Germans. The first was Jan Rychtar, a Wendish Moravian Brethren missionary who settled in Sydney during 1844. There were two major migrations of Upper Sorbs and Lower Sorbs to Australia, in 1848 and 1850 respectively. The diaspora settled mainly in South Australia – especially the Barossa Valley – as well as Victoria and New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Slovak dialects {{have the}} {{greatest}} degree of mutual intelligibility with Polish of all the Slovak dialects followed by Rusyn, but both lack technical terminology and upper register expressions. Polish and <b>Sorbian</b> also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some mutual intelligibility occurs with spoken Rusyn, Ukrainian, and even Russian (in this order), although their orthographies {{are based on the}} Cyrillic script.|$|E
25|$|Declensional endings {{depend on}} case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, instrumental, vocative), number (singular, dual or plural), gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and animacy (animate vs inanimate). Unusual in other {{language}} families, declension in most Slavic languages {{also depends on}} whether the word is a noun or an adjective. Slovene and <b>Sorbian</b> languages use a rare third number, (in addition to singular and plural numbers) known as dual (in case of some words dual survived also in Polish and other Slavic languages). Modern Russian and Czech also use a more complex form of dual, but this misnomer applies instead to numbers 2, 3, 4, and larger numbers ending in 2, 3, or 4 (with {{the exception of the}} teens, which are handled as plural; thus, 102 is dual, but 12 or 127 are not).|$|E
25|$|In 1007 Henry {{denounced the}} Peace of Poznań, which caused Bolesław's {{attack on the}} Archbishopric of Magdeburg {{as well as the}} re-occupation of the marches of Lusatia, through he stopped short of retaking Meissen. The German counter-offensive began three years later, in 1010, but it was of no {{significant}} consequence. In 1012, a five-year peace was signed. Bolesław broke the peace, however, and once again invaded Lusatia. Bolesław's forces pillaged and burned the city of Lubusz (Lebus). In 1013, a peace accord was signed at Merseburg. As part of the treaty, Bolesław paid homage to Henry II for the March of Lusatia (including the town of Bautzen) and <b>Sorbian</b> Meissen as fiefs. A marriage of Bolesław's son Mieszko with Richeza of Lotharingia, daughter of the Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II was also performed. During the brief period of peace on the western frontier that followed, Bolesław took part in a short campaign in the east, towards the Kievan Rus' territories.|$|E
25|$|Lusatian {{tribes are}} {{noted in the}} work of the Bavarian Geographer. The {{document}} contains a list of the tribes in Central-Eastern Europe east of the Elbe and north of the Danube to the Volga rivers to the Black and Caspian Sea most of them of Slavic origin. Having settled by the Elbe, Spree and Neisse in the 6th century, <b>Sorbian</b> tribes divided into two main groups, which have taken their names from the characteristics of the area where they had settled. Sorbs living on the swampy broads of the Lower Spree have taken their name from the word marsh. The Milceni (ancestors of Upper Sorbs) settled on fertile soil around Upper Spree, the name derives from the word měl’ (loess soil). The two groups were separated from each other by a wide and uninhabited forest range. The rest of the tribes settled themselves between the Elbe and Saale. Among the many Slavic tribes, the Bavarian Geographer also noted a few Lusatian tribes: Glomacze - Dolomici, Milceni, Chutizi and Sitice.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Bolesław's son Mieszko {{was sent}} to plunder Meissen. His attempt at conquering the city, however, failed. In 1017, Bolesław {{defeated}} Margrave Henry V of Bavaria. In that same year, supported by his Slavic allies, Henry II once again invaded Poland, however, once again to very little effect. He did besiege the cities of Głogów and Niemcza, {{but was unable to}} conquer them. The imperial forces once again were forced to retreat, suffering significant losses. Taking advantage of the involvement of Czech troops, Bolesław ordered his son to invade Bohemia, where Mieszko met very little resistance. On 30 January 1018, the Peace of Bautzen was signed. The Polish ruler was able to keep the contested marches of Lusatia and <b>Sorbian</b> Meissen not as fiefs, but as a part of Polish territory, and also received military aid in his expedition against Kievan Rus. Also, Bolesław (then a widower) strengthened his dynastic bonds with the German nobility through his marriage with Oda, daughter of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. The wedding took place four days later, on 3 February in the castle of Cziczani (also Sciciani, at the site of either modern Groß-Seitschen or Zützen).|$|E
2500|$|On May 10, 1945, in Crostwitz, {{after the}} Red Army’s invasion, the Domowina Institution renewed its activity. In 1948 Landtag of Saxony passed an Act guaranteeing {{protection}} to <b>Sorbian</b> Lusatians; in 1949 Brandenburg resolved a similar law. In {{the times of}} the German Democratic Republic, <b>Sorbian</b> organizations were financially supported by the country, {{but at the same}} time the authorities encouraged Germanization of <b>Sorbian</b> youth as a means of incorporating them into the system of [...] "building Socialism". <b>Sorbian</b> language and culture could only be publicly presented as long as they promoted socialist ideology.|$|E
2500|$|Sorbs {{arrived in}} the area {{extending}} between the Bober, Kwisa, and Oder rivers to the East and the Saale and Elbe rivers to the West during the 6th century. [...] In the north, the area of their settlement reached Berlin. [...] The earliest surviving mention of the tribe was in 631 A.D., when Fredegar's Chronicle described them as Surbi and as {{under the rule of}} a Dervan, an ally of Samo. [...] The Annales Regni Francorum state that in 806 A.D. <b>Sorbian</b> Duke Miliduch fought against the Franks and was killed. [...] In 840, <b>Sorbian</b> Duke Czimislav was killed. [...] In 932, Henry I conquered Lusatia and Milsko. [...] Gero II, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark, reconquered Lusatia the following year and, in 939, murdered 30 <b>Sorbian</b> princes during a feast. [...] As a result, there were many <b>Sorbian</b> uprisings against German rule. [...] A reconstructed castle, at Raddusch in Lower Lusatia, is the sole physical remnant from this early period.|$|E
2500|$|Lower <b>Sorbian</b> language: bawory or bawery (in older or dialectal use) [...] {{from the}} name of the Bavarian tribe.|$|E
2500|$|The West Slavic {{group can}} be divided into three subgroups: [...] Lechitic, {{including}} [...] Polish, Kashubian and extinct Polabian and Pomeranian languages, [...] Lusatian (<b>Sorbian)</b> and Czecho-Slovak.|$|E
2500|$|Slovak (...) is an Indo-European {{language}} {{that belongs to}} the West Slavic languages (together with Czech, Polish, Silesian, Kashubian and <b>Sorbian).</b> It is called [...] (...) or [...] (...) in the language itself.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of the {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} was Polish historian Wilhelm Bogusławski, who lived in the 19th century and wrote the first book on Polish-Sorbian history Rys dziejów serbołużyckich (Polish title), it was published in Saint Petersburg in 1861. The book was expanded and published again in cooperation with Michał Hórnik in 1884 in Bautzen, under a new title Historije serbskeho naroda. Alfons Parczewski was another friend of Sorbs, who from 1875 was involved in Sorbs' rights protection, participating in <b>Sorbian</b> meetings in Bautzen. It was thanks to him, among others, that Józef Ignacy Kraszewski founded a scholarship for <b>Sorbian</b> students. An association of friends of <b>Sorbian</b> Nation was established at the University of Warsaw in 1936 (Polish full name: Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Narodu Serbo-Łużyckiego). It gathered people not only from the university. Its president was Professor Stanisław Słoński, and the deputy president was Julia Wieleżyńska. The association was a legal entity. There were three individual organizations devoted to <b>Sorbian</b> matters. Prołuż founded in Krotoszyn, expanded to all Poland (3000 members). It was the biggest non-communist organization that dealt with foreign affairs. This youth organization was created during the Soviet occupation and its motto was [...] "Polish guard over Lusatia" [...] (pl. Nad Łużycami polska straż). Its highest activity was in Greater Poland (Polish: Wielkopolska, [...] a district of western Poland).|$|E
2500|$|The Ukrainian language, {{in common}} with Czech, Slovak, Upper <b>Sorbian,</b> Belarusian and {{southern}} Russian dialects, has changed the Common Slavic [...] "g" [...] into an [...] "h" [...] sound (for example, noha – leg).|$|E
