40|$|Globally, client-perpetrated {{violence}} against female sex workers (FSWs) {{has been associated}} with multiple health-related harms, including high-risk sexual behavior and increased exposure to HIV/STIs. This study examined correlates of client-perpetrated sexual, physical, and economic violence (e. g., robbery) against FSWs in 13 cities throughout Mexico. FSWs (N = 1, 089) who were enrolled in a brief, evidence-based, sexual risk reduction intervention for FSWs (Mujer Segura) were interviewed about their work context, including experiences of violence perpetrated by clients, sexual risk and substance use practices, financial need, and social supports. Three broad categories of factors (sociodemographic, work context, behavioral and social characteristics of FSWs) were examined as correlates of sexual, physical, and economic violence. The prevalence of different types of client-perpetrated {{violence against}} FSWs in the past 6 months was: sexual (11. 7 %), physical (11. 8 %), economic (16. 9 %), and any violence (22. 6 %). Greater financial need, self-identification as a <b>street</b> <b>worker,</b> and lower perceived emotional support were independently associated with all three types of violence. Alcohol use before or during sex with clients in the past month was associated with physical and sexual violence. Using drugs before or during sex with clients, injection drug use in the past month, and population size of city were associated with sexual violence only, and FSWs' alcohol use score (AUDIT-C) was associated with economic violence only. Correlates of client-perpetrated violence encompassed sociodemographic, work context, and behavioral and social factors, suggesting that approaches to violence prevention for FSWs must be multi-dimensional. Prevention could involve teaching FSWs strategies for risk avoidance in the workplace (e. g., avoiding use of alcohol with clients), enhancement of FSWs' community-based supports, development of interventions that deliver an anti-violence curriculum to clients, and programs to address FSWs' financial need by increasing their economic opportunities outside of the sex trade...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the {{processes}} of redefinition of public spaces in relation to the logic of appropriation of these spaces by <b>street</b> <b>workers</b> in Fortaleza as a form of “counter-use”. It focuses in particular on the tensions that arise from the different possibilities for use and the different meanings attributed to public spaces by residents, workers, shop owners and those who frequent the city’s historic center. The paper sought to contextualize the intervention of the Fortaleza municipal government and the political struggle of formal and informal workers to assure their work, and as a consequence, their survival. The research results indicate that survival in the street subverts the laws and formal market standards of capitalist society, which is based on salaried work. Na important conclusion is that by appropriating public spaces, the <b>street</b> <b>workers</b> alter the expected uses with a counter-use that is established by disputes and challenges to the right to work...|$|R

40|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and HIV infection {{are increasing}} {{at an alarming}} rate in Mexico (United Nations Program on AIDS [UNAIDS], 2006). Female sex workers (FSWs) are one of the groups affected by the increase in HIV prevalence in Mexico. Early surveillance of FSWs found seroprevalence rates of 4. 8 % in Tijuana and 4. 9 % in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (Patterson et al., 2006 b), while the most recent study of FSWs from these two cities found a seroprevalence rate of 6 % (Strathdee et al, in press). Prevention efforts that are culturally sensitive and appropriately tailored are needed to stem the rise of HIV in this high-risk population. The current study examined the applicability of the Social Ecological model for HIV prevention in a sample of female sex workers (FSWs) (N= 472) participating in a safe sex counseling intervention in Tijuana, Mexico. Within the framework of the Social Ecological Model we explored differential predictors of condom use by comparing women who work in bar settings to those who work on the street hypothesizing that there would be differences across venue (bar vs street) with higher condom use in bar workers. Baseline models were established using path analysis in bar (N= 233); (CFI=. 890, RMSEA =. 062) and <b>street</b> <b>workers</b> (N= 203); (CFI =. 928, RMSEA =. 040). For bar workers individual level factors, (self-efficacy, condom use beliefs, alcohol use before sex) and institutional level factors (condom access) were directly and indirectly related to condom use, while in <b>street</b> <b>workers</b> interpersonal level factors (social support, previous abuse, client power) and drug use were the most important factors associated with condom use. Multiple group partial structural invariance was then performed comparing <b>street</b> <b>workers</b> (N= 79) to bar workers (N= 103) on the 5 paths that their baseline models shared, showing that these paths were invariant across groups ([delta][chi]²(5) = 6. 30). Multiple group comparisons found similarities between the bar and <b>street</b> <b>workers,</b> including the relationship between self-efficacy and condom use. Baseline model comparisons found differences including the type of substance used before sex, and the relationship between monetary incentives for unprotected sex and condom use self- efficacy, supporting the need for the tailoring of interventions for women based on location of their sex wor...|$|R
