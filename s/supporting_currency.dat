However, {{by the time the}} Conference gathered, President Roosevelt had changed his mind, <b>supporting</b> <b>currency</b> manipulation to raise prices, and had American banking experts O.M.W. Sprague and James Paul Warburg conduct currency stabilization talks with their British and French counterparts.

40|$|Many {{activities}} are comprised of temporally dependent events {{that must be}} executed in a specific chronological order. Supportive software applications must preserve these temporal dependencies. Whenever the processing {{of this type of}} an application includes transactions submitted to a database that is shared with other such applications, the transaction concurrency control mechanisms within the database must also preserve the temporal dependencies. A basis for preserving temporal dependencies is established by using (within the applications and databases) real-time timestamps to identify and order events and transactions. The use of optimistic approaches to transaction concurrency control can be undesirable in such situations, as they allow incorrect results for database read operations. Although the incorrectness is detected prior to transaction committal and the corresponding transaction(s) restarted, the impact on the application or entity that submitted the transaction can be too costly. Three transaction concurrency control algorithms are proposed in this dissertation. These algorithms are based on timestamp ordering, and are designed to preserve temporal dependencies existing among data-dependent transactions. The algorithms produce execution schedules that are equivalent to temporally ordered serial schedules, where the temporal order is established by the transactions' start times. The algorithms provide this equivalence while <b>supporting</b> <b>currency</b> to the extent out-of-order commits and reads. With respect to the stated concern with optimistic approaches, two of the proposed algorithms are risk-free and return to read operations only committed data-item values. Risk with the third algorithm is greatly reduced by its conservative bias. All three algorithms avoid deadlock while providing risk-free or reduced-risk operation. The performance of the algorithms is determined analytically and with experimentation. Experiments are performed using functional database management system models that implement the proposed algorithms and the well-known Conservative Multiversion Timestamp Ordering algorithm...|$|E

40|$|As {{financial}} crises followed capital account {{opening in the}} 1990 s the hard peg of a currency board regime {{was seen as the}} remaining 'polar' alternative to flexible exchange rates. With the Argentine peso devaluation of early 2002 suggesting that the fundamental requirement may be peg abandonment through either floating or 'dollarisation', the issue as it confronts highly open LDSs reliant on a narrow export base of primary commodities has been substantially neglected. Under pressure to increase financial openness, and with exchange rate variability posing a threat to their price level stability, the study asks whether pegging could remain an effective choice for such economies. Saudi Arabia has combined extreme commodity dependence with financial openness under a rigid peg and her experience is examined for the wider lessons it may contain.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} currency {{question in the}} context of colonialism in East Africa. It contends that currency constitutes an important nodal point through which state-society relations are carried out. Therefore one is able, through this lens, both to look at questions of the state-ness of the colonial state as well as the ways in which power and resistance are manifested by social money usage. ^ This dissertation is concerned with the sorts of confrontations and negotiations conducted through the medium of disputes over the appropriate types and uses of money. It contends that monetary systems, which are taken to be the institutions that issue and regulate currency, as well as the practices and policies that <b>support</b> <b>currency</b> circulation {{are an important part of}} a political negotiation carried out between the state and society. The state often attempts to discipline and categorize people through their relationship to its currency, while society is ingenious in finding ways to escape and evade these means of control precisely through its uses of the same currency. In colonial East Africa, disputes over the currency ranged from what the appropriate currency should be to what the design on the currency notes should represent. One of the focal points of this dissertation is the East African Currency Board, which administered currency through most of the colonial period. ...|$|R
