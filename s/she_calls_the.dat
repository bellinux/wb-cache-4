At the same time, Jeannie, {{frustrated}} that the entire school believes Ferris has come down with a deathly illness, skips class and returns home to confront him, only to hear someone outside trying to break-in. Rooney flees while <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> police; when they arrive, they arrest her for filing a false report, and contact her mother to collect her. While waiting, she meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris.

Betty departs, {{confused}} and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown in Ohio.

25|$|Werfel {{planned a}} novel about a fictional Catholic saint's life in late seventeenth-century Venice titled Legends, with various subtitles: The Intercessoress of Animals, of Snakes, and of the Dead. Much of the {{research}} for this book would eventually inform The Song of Bernadette (1942), a novel he dedicated to Manon but also features elements of her character and appearance in both the character Bernadette and the apparition of the Blessed Virgin, which <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Lady in White {{as well as being}} a pagan term related to the Weisse Frauen of German folklore. Werfel also wrote a necrology about Manon's life for the Catholic journal Commonweal to explain the significance of his dedication, something he never did for other books. Other Werfel novels also feature characters modeled on Manon, notably the prophet Jeremiah's Egyptian bride-to-be in Hearken unto the Voice (1937) and the Bride in Werfel's last novel, Star of the Unborn (1946). Manon Gropius is also a minor character in the 2001 novel The Artist's Wife by Max Phillips, which is based on the life of Alma Mahler.|$|E

When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under [...] "future wife". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw it out of a window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.|$|E

The remaining five articles in the section come from The Globe and Mail, with one from The Nation; they cover the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization (WTO) protests in Washington, D.C., Prague, and Toronto from April to September 2000.

500|$|Reviews of Kids Can Say No! have {{generally}} been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 Times review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. <b>She</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> film's theme song [...] "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music {{that is hard to}} forget".|$|E
500|$|In {{many ways}} the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world, as is its direct {{predecessor}} the Rights of Men.

She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, {{were associated with the}} middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the [...] "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" [...] of the rich, calling them [...] "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [...] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".|$|E

500|$|Historian Deborah Gray White {{builds on}} Blassingame's {{research}} of the family life of the slaves in Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South (1985). Her argument is similar to Blassingame's: [...] "This present study {{takes a look at}} slave women in America and argues that they were not submissive, subordinate, or prudish and that they were not expected to be so." [...] White discusses the Mammy and Jezebel stereotypes often applied to African American women by white Americans. <b>She</b> <b>calls</b> <b>The</b> Slave Community [...] "a classic" [...] but remarks that [...] "Blassingame stressed the fact that many masters recognized the male {{as the head of the}} family. He observed that during courtship men flattered women and exaggerated their prowess. There was, however, little discussion of the reciprocal activities of slave women." [...] She concludes that Blassingame [...] "described how slave men gained status in the family, but he did not do the same for women." ...|$|E
500|$|In a School Library Journal article, Anne Beier of the Hendrick Hudson Free Library in Montrose, New York {{gives the}} book a {{positive}} review, praising Birdsall's writing and describing {{the story as}} funny, sweet, heartwarming, and suspenseful.

Connie Fletcher of Booklist also gives the book a positive review, comparing the two eponymous characters to Pyramus and Thisbe, two lovers in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses. In her review, Fletcher calls the book [...] "a fun canine fantasy with humor, excitement, a happy ending, and, most important of all, two ridiculously adorable dogs that end up getting their way - as dogs tend to do".|$|E
