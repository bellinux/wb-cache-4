50|$|Stanislas's {{efforts to}} pass {{legislation}} in the Assembly ultimately failed as he would end up dead {{at the hands of}} the riots. Many of his fellow nobles such as Barnave and Brissot would ultimately meet the <b>same</b> <b>fates</b> under 40 brought upon them by the revolutionaries.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} campaign, Agu was loaned to Galician neighbours CD Ourense in Segunda División, {{where he met}} exactly the <b>same</b> individual <b>fate.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of the Israelite Kingdoms, Lebanon and Israel (including present-day Jordan) could be {{recognized}} as distinct entities, although they remained close allies, experiencing the <b>same</b> <b>fates</b> with changing regional developments. During this period, parts of modern Lebanon were under the control of Jerusalem, and Jews lived as far north as Baal-Hermon on the slopes of Mount Hermon (sometimes identified with Hasbaya, which once again became an important center of Jewish life {{in the first half of}} the 20th century).|$|R
5|$|H-class {{battleship}} proposals - A German battleship of {{a similar}} size and <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Qurayyat, {{which they}} took {{after a hard}} fight, the Portuguese {{mutilated}} their captives, killed the inhabitants regardless of sex or age, and despoiled and burned the town. Muscat, at first, surrendered unconditionally to avoid the <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 26, Arnold {{was joined}} by 2,300 troops under command of Major General William Phillips, who took command of the {{combined}} forces. Phillips resumed raiding, defeating the militia at Blandford, then burning the tobacco warehouses at Petersburg on April 25. Richmond was about to suffer the <b>same</b> <b>fate,</b> but Lafayette arrived. The British, not wanting {{to engage in a}} major battle, withdrew to Petersburg on May 10.|$|E
50|$|Endymion and Actaeon {{start in}} areas where it is {{possible}} for them (or other heroes) to experience the <b>same</b> tragic <b>fates</b> that befell them in myth.|$|R
5000|$|Bishop Allen {{released}} {{a song called}} [...] "Empire City" [...] that references Samson with the lines: [...] "Samson suffered the <b>same</b> fame <b>fate,</b> powerless and losing his hair." ...|$|R
5|$|Moira {{explains}} {{that while some}} ghosts in the house only wish for the living to suffer the <b>same</b> <b>fates</b> they did, other ghosts are innocent and {{do not wish to}} see any more bloodshed. The Harmons realize the house is a danger to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|R
5|$|The {{commission}} appointed Galen Clark as the grant's first guardian, {{but neither}} Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority}} to evict homesteaders. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> as Niagara Falls, which at that time was a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} the player character, an unnamed human, being killed and resurrected as a fledgling vampire. For this {{unauthorized}} act, the fledgling and their Sire are brought before the Camarilla. The Sire is executed by order of LaCroix; the fledgling is spared the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> by {{the intervention of the}} Anarch, Nines Rodriguez, and employed by the prince.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> in 1948.|$|E
50|$|He {{was sentenced}} to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the {{execution}} took place at Charing Cross on 16 October. Many contemporaries reported him as being in despair. Peters was forced to watch John Cook suffering emasculation and disembowelment, before enduring the <b>same</b> gory <b>fate</b> himself.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, McMahon had to no alliances {{formed as}} he hosted [...] "McMahon's Million Dollar Mania" [...] {{for the first}} half and was {{inactive}} the rest of the year, as the Million Dollar Mania storyline ended with yet another [...] "death" [...] for McMahon {{in the form of a}} pyrotechnic accident. This angle was a work, but was made to look real as possible with Triple H coming to Vince's aid, and Vince calling him by his real first name [...] "Paul." [...] In late 2008/early 2009, Vince returned, but only to be punted by Randy Orton. Weeks later, Shane and Stephanie would suffer the <b>same</b> <b>fates.</b> This would be the beginning of the fan favorite alliance of Team McMahon.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{household}} income fails to recognize household size. For example, a single attorney, earning $95,000, {{may have a}} higher standard of living than a family of four with an income of $120,000. Yet {{household income}} is still a commonly used class indicator, as household members share the <b>same</b> economic <b>fate</b> and class position.|$|R
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b> As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b> The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 4): The Fate of the Phoenix" [...] {{is based}} on the comic of the <b>same</b> name ("The <b>Fate</b> of the Phoenix!") in Uncanny X-Men #137 (September, 1980).|$|R
5000|$|In the Beetleborgs Metallix episode [...] "Poe and the Pendulum", {{the ghost}} of Edgar Allan Poe arrives at Hillhust Mansion seeking {{inspiration}} for a new book. Throughout the episode he tortures the tenants by subjecting them to the <b>same</b> gruesome <b>fates</b> as the characters in his past stories such as [...] "The Black Cat", [...] "The Pit and the Pendulum", and [...] "The Premature Burial".|$|R
50|$|The Company's first Hall was bequeathed by William Elder, Citizen and Plaisterer in 1556. It was {{situated}} {{on the corner of}} Addle Street and Philip Lane but was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Its second Hall was built in 1669 to the design of Sir Christopher Wren, although this too met the <b>same</b> sad <b>fate</b> by being destroyed by fire in 1882.|$|R
5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she would rule the world but met the <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b> After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the expedition and {{with the majority of}} his forces in his way back, Przemysł II received a confidential message that the fortress of Drezdenko was protected by only a few German knights. The young prince, {{despite the fact that he}} only had a part of his forces, decided to make a quick attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music of}} the Bugaloos {{suffered}} the <b>same</b> typecasting <b>fate</b> which met the music of The Partridge Family, despite excellent production values in both cases. [...] "Just the Memory Stays Around", [...] "The Senses of Our World" [...] and [...] "Castles in the Air" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} other songs of the same title) deserve particular note. Their lyrics were far above typical children's television fare: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} begins, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is soaring {{through the sky}} hoping to travel at a speed more than 60 miles per hour. Eventually, with luck {{he is able to}} break that barrier, but when Jonathan returns to his own flock he is greeted with {{anything}} but applause. The Elders of the flock shame Jonathan for doing things the other seagulls never dare to do. Jonathan pleads to stay and claims that he wants to share his newfound discovery with everybody, but the Elders dismiss him as an outcast, and he is banished from the flock. Jonathan goes off on his own, believing that all hope is lost. However, he is soon greeted by mysterious seagulls from other lands who assure him that his talent is a unique one, and with them Jonathan is trained to become independent and proud of his beliefs. Eventually, Jonathan himself ends up becoming a mentor for other seagulls who are suffering the <b>same</b> <b>fates</b> in their own flocks as he once did.|$|R
50|$|The {{narrative}} of Dionysius {{does not suggest}} the slightest reproach as to this act of St. Apollonia; in his eyes she {{was as much a}} martyr as the others, and as such she was revered in the Alexandrian Church. In time, her feast was also popular in the West. A later narrative mistakenly duplicated Apollonia, making her a Christian virgin of Rome in the reign of Julian the Apostate, suffering the <b>same</b> dental <b>fate.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the <b>same</b> <b>fate,</b> but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E
5|$|The first {{committee}} {{to design the}} Great Seal of the United States was appointed on 4 July 1776 by the Second Continental Congress and consisted of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson. Their design was rejected on 20 August 1776. The second committee (James Lovell, John Morin Scott, and William Churchill Houston) design met with the <b>same</b> <b>fate.</b> It was the third committee (Arthur Middleton, Elias Boudinot, John Rutledge, who consulted with William Barton) that submitted a design which was approved on 20 July 1782.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} games were in Anaheim, both won by the Ducks by one-goal margins. Game 3 went to the Senators, but Game 4 in Ottawa was won by the Ducks, for an insurmountable three games to one lead. The Ducks would finish the series in Game 5 at home. The Ducks had been favoured to win the Cup since before the season started. The Senators were the third {{consecutive}} Canadian franchise to reach the Final and they suffered the <b>same</b> <b>fate</b> as the Calgary Flames of 2004 and the Edmonton Oilers of 2006.|$|E
50|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, destiny {{was just}} {{a manifestation of the}} Will to Live, which can be at the <b>same</b> time living <b>fate</b> and choice of {{overrunning}} fate, by means of the Art, of the Morality and of the Ascesis.|$|R
50|$|Nick Romano, Jr., {{whose father}} was a convicted {{criminal}} sentenced {{to die in the}} electric chair, lives in a Chicago tenement building, where concerned neighbors do what they can to keep him from the <b>same</b> life and <b>fate</b> as his father.|$|R
2500|$|The Johnny Appleseed Suite, Carmichael's second {{classical}} {{work for}} orchestra, suffered the <b>same</b> ill <b>fate</b> as his earlier attempt with Brown County Autumn. The musical suite received little notice and only limited success, but Carmichael remained financially secure {{due to the}} royalties from his past hits. During the 1940s and 1950s Carmichael also found time to write {{more than a dozen}} songs for children, including [...] "The Whale Song," [...] "Merry-Go-Round," [...] and [...] "Rocket Ship," [...] among others.|$|R
