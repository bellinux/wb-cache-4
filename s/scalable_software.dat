50|$|In September 2006 {{the founders}} of metasfresh started with Open Source ERP {{development}} as early contributors in the ADempiere ERP Project. They were founding members of the ADempiere Foundation and longtime members of Functional and Technical Team at ADempiere. In industry-specific ERP projects in the SME sector they developed several new features based on ADempiere 3.5.4 and rewrote the majority of ADempiere Code to allow a more maintainable, flexible and <b>scalable</b> <b>Software</b> for midsize companies. The user base they built up demanded shorter and more reliable release cycles to allow more flexibility in providing solutions for their requirements. This, plus the already resulted gap in development compared to the latest ADempiere Codebase {{was the reason for}} the team to decide in 2015 to officially fork from ADempiere and proceed the development in a new project called metasfresh.|$|E

To prevent frequent duplication of effort, a <b>scalable</b> <b>software</b> architecture was needed to provide the required control.This architecture needed to accommodate multiple users and developers, since many different graduate students and post docs are sharing the software and hardware resources required to run their respective experiments.LabRAD was specifically designed to alleviate the problems inherent in designing a complex, scalable control system managed by several developers and users.As science advances, novel experiments in all fields are becoming increasingly involved, making LabRAD a generally useful tool beyond the developing group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Owing to {{the extreme}} {{parallelism}} and the high component failure rates of tomorrow’s exascale, high-performance computing (HPC) system software {{will need to be}} scalable, failure-resistant, and adaptive for sustained system operation and full system utilizations. Many of the existing HPC system software are still designed around a centralized server paradigm and hence are susceptible to scaling issues and single points of failure. In this article, we explore the design tradeoffs for <b>scalable</b> system <b>software</b> at extreme scales. We propose a general system software taxonomy by deconstructing common HPC system software into their basic components. The taxonomy helps us reason about system software as follows: (1) it gives us a systematic way to architect <b>scalable</b> system <b>software</b> by decomposing them into their basic components; (2) it allows us to categorize system software based on the features of these components, and finally (3) it suggests the configuration space to consider for design evaluation via simulations or real implementations. Further, we evaluate different design choices of a representative system software, i. e. key-value store, through simulations up to millions of nodes. Finally, we show evaluation results of two distributed system software, Slurm++ (a distributed HPC resource manager) and MATRIX (a distributed task execution framework), both developed based on insights from this work. We envision that the results in this article help to lay the foundations of developing next-generation HPC system software for extreme scales...|$|R
