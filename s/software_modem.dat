40|$|Most {{existing}} underwater networks target {{deep and}} long range oceanic environments, {{which has led}} to the design of power hungry and expensive underwater communication hardware. Because of prohibitive monetary and energy cost of currently overengineered communication hardware, dense deployments of shallow water sensor networks remain an elusive goal. To enable dense shallow water networks, we propose a network architecture that builds on the success of terrestrial sensor motes and that relies on the coupling of <b>software</b> <b>modems</b> and widely available speakers and microphones in sensor motes to establish acoustic communication links. In this paper, we analytically and empirically explore the potential of this acoustic communication system for the underwater environment. Our experimental approach first profiles the hardware in water after waterproofing the components with elastic membranes. The medium profiling results expose the favorable frequencies of operation for the hardware, enabling us to design a <b>software</b> FSK <b>modem.</b> Subsequently, our experiments evaluate the data transfer capability of the underwater channel with 8 -frequency FSK <b>software</b> <b>modems.</b> The experiments within a 17 x 8 m controlled underwater environment yield an error-free channel capacity of 24 bps, and they also demonstrate that the system supports date rates between 6 and 48 bps with adaptive fidelity. ∗ Corresponding author...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{technological}} {{improvements and}} application opportunities have fueled {{increased interest in}} the development and deployment of underwater acoustic sensor networks. De-ployment efforts have been impeded by the prohibitive monetary cost and high power consumption of existing acoustic hardware. Alternately, we propose underwater networks that rely on widely available speakers and microphones in electronic devices, coupled with <b>software</b> <b>modems,</b> to establish acoustic communication links. The proposed acoustic communications system paves the way for cheap and easily deployable underwater acoustic sensor networks through the use of audio hardware built in to sensor nodes, namely the Tmote Invent modules. In this paper, we explore the potential of the acoustic communication system for both aerial and underwater environments with the generic PC microphone as a receiver and with two transmitter types: (1) generic PC speakers; and (2) Tmote Invent speakers. We follow a systematic experimental approach that first profiles the hardware communication capability in air. We then repeat the profiling in water after waterproofing the components with elastic membranes. Subsequently, our experiments evaluate the data transfer capability of the underwater channel with 8 -frequency FSK <b>software</b> <b>modems.</b> The data transfer experiments reveal that within a communication range of 17 m the Tmote Invent speakers can transfer between 6 and 48 bps with respective bit error rates of 5 % to 21 %.

50|$|Alternatively {{the term}} fax server is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a program that enables a computer to send and receive fax messages, set of software running on a server computer which is equipped {{with one or more}} fax-capable modems (or dedicated fax boards) attached to telephone lines or, more recently, <b>software</b> <b>modem</b> emulators which use T.38 ("Fax over IP") technology to transmit the signal over an IP network. Its function is to accept documents from users, convert them into faxes, and transmit them, as well as to receive fax calls and either store the incoming documents or pass them on to users. Users may communicate with the server in several ways, through either a local network or the Internet. In a big organization with heavy fax traffic, the computer hosting the fax server may be dedicated to that function, in which case the computer itself may also be known as a fax server.|$|E
