Investigating the matter, Jones {{was unable to}} establish whether or not Cole had been drunk but was satisfied {{that he had not}} behaved appropriately, and issued him a warning without charging or otherwise disciplining him. Under pressure from the Federal government, Jones dismissed Cole from the position of AMP and posted him to Ceylon in January 1945 as RAAF Liaison Officer to South East Asia Command.

Leopold was hailed as a [...] "martyr" [...] or a symbol of national resilience, in contrast to a Government that appeared to place its ideology above the interests of the Belgian people. On 31 May 1940, the <b>senior</b> <b>representative</b> of the Catholic Church in Belgium, Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, circulated a pastoral letter calling for all Belgians to unite around the King. Other figures in the King's entourage, particularly the authoritarian socialist Henri De Man, believed that democracy had failed and {{that the end of the}} war would see the King as the ruler of an authoritarian Belgian state.|$|E
500|$|During the {{fighting}} in South Ossetia, the Russian Air Force repeatedly attacked Tbilisi and its surrounding areas. On 8 August, the Georgian Interior Ministry reported that two bombs were dropped on Vaziani Military Base near the city. Prior to the war, the bombed base near Tbilisi had housed the Russian military before the government of Georgia forced their withdrawal to Russia. The Daily Telegraph described this bombing as [...] "Russia's revenge". A Georgian military airstrip in Marneuli was bombed, killing three people. The Georgian government evacuated their offices on 9 August. Georgian officials said on 9 August that Russian air attacks had targeted the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, but missed.

2500|$|Another {{difference}} between Scottish and English heraldry {{that may be}} discerned from {{the appearance of the}} shield itself lies in the systems employed to distinguish younger sons of an armiger, known as cadency. [...] English heraldry uses a series of small symbols, termed brisures, to differentiate between the <b>senior</b> <b>representative</b> of an armigerous family and junior lines known as [...] "cadet branches". [...] In Scotland, except for the line of the immediate heir, this function is served by a series of bordures (borders) surrounding the shield of varying, specified colors and designs, named the [...] "Stodart" [...] system. In Scottish practice brisures function only as [...] "temporary house marks of cadency used by children ... without formal authority of the Lyon Office, until they establish houses of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kennel Club {{complaints}} upheld in {{the provisional}} findings that BBC had contested earlier was the unfair representation of Kennel Club geneticist Jeff Sampson's views {{and lack of}} an opportunity to respond for the Crufts champion cover-up claim. While the provisional finding stated that there was [...] "some unfair treatment" [...] of the Kennel Club, the released finding acknowledges that Sampson's views were misrepresented but states that as a whole, the Kennel Club was not treated unfairly. The Kennel Club states that [...] "Professor Sampson is our <b>senior</b> <b>representative</b> and spokesman on the health and genetic issues affecting dogs. It is therefore surprising that Ofcom doesn’t also conclude, on this occasion, that the Kennel Club itself was therefore unfairly represented. Ofcom has actually changed its mind on this point since its provisional decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} around World War II, this rationalistic and optimistic {{theology}} was challenged and questioned. It was gradually replaced, mainly by the Jewish existentialism of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, {{centered on a}} complex, personal relationship with the creator, and a more sober and disillusioned outlook. The identification of human reason with Godly inspiration was rejected in favour of views such as Rosenzweig's, who emphasized that the only content of revelation is it in itself, while all derivations of it are subjective, limited human understanding. However, while granting higher status to historical and traditional understanding, both insisted that [...] "revelation is certainly not Law giving" [...] and {{that it did not}} contain any [...] "finished statements about God", but rather that human subjectivity shaped the unfathomable content of the Encounter and interpreted it under its own limitations. The <b>senior</b> <b>representative</b> of postwar Reform theology, Eugene Borowitz, regarded theophany in postmodern terms and closely linked it with quotidian human experience and interpersonal contact. He rejected the notion of [...] "progressive revelation" [...] in the meaning of comparing human betterment with divine inspiration, stressing that past experiences were [...] "unique" [...] and of everlasting importance. Yet he stated that his ideas by no means negated the concept of ongoing, individually experienced revelation by all.|$|E
