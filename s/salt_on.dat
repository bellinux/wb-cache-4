The adverts attracted complaints {{from the public}} for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers.

5|$|Defending {{the right}} flank and {{subsidiary}} to the Nablus battle, the Third Transjordan attack began on 22 September when Meldrum's Force, {{a section of}} Chaytor's Force captured the 53rd Ottoman Division on the Wadi el Fara road, running from Nablus to the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh over the Jordan River. Further sections of the retreating Seventh Army column were attacked and captured, during the subsequent battle for the bridge when several fords were also captured along with the bridge, cutting this main Ottoman line of retreat eastwards. As the Fourth Army began its retreat, Chaytor's Force supported by reconnaissance and attacking aircraft, advanced from Jisr ed Damieh to the east to capture Es <b>Salt</b> <b>on</b> 23 September. This force continued its advance eastwards, to capture Amman on 25 September, after a strong Fourth Army rearguard was defeated there.

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin had been successful and the XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode was ordered to begin its attack, supported by an artillery barrage, against the well-defended Ottoman front line. The attacks continued until midday on 21 September, when a successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area towards the River Jordan crossing at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge before the rearguard at Nablus was captured. The Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel advanced through the gap provided by the infantry on 19 September to almost encircle the fighting in the Judean Hills, capturing Nazareth, Haifa, Afulah, Beisan, Jenin and Samakh, before advancing to Tiberias. During this time, Chaytor's Force commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor captured part of the retreating Ottoman and German column at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge to cut this line of retreat across the Jordan River. To the east of this river, as the Fourth Army began its retreat, Chaytor's Force advanced to capture Es <b>Salt</b> <b>on</b> 23 September.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a variety of chlorides, sodium salts, {{potassium}} salts and low-molecular sugars on pressure-induced gelatinisation of wheat, tapioca and potato starches has been investigated. Just as thermal gelatinisation, pressure-induced gelatinisation is influenced by solutes in the starch suspensions. In general the effects of <b>salts</b> and sugars <b>on</b> starch gelatinisation were comparable for thermal and pressure treatments. For example, the gelatinisation pressure was reduced by sugars whereas the degree of gelatinisation was linearly correlated with the number of equatorial hydroxyl groups. The influence of <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> the gelatinisation pressure varied and the extent of effect on the gelatinisation pressure did not only depend on the solute added but also on the type of starch. At high chloride concentrations (. 2 M) the impact of the <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> starch gelatinisation augmentation followed the order Na 1,K 1,Li 1,Ca 21, which corre-sponds to the order of the lyotropic series.

25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand {{in a large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the <b>salt</b> <b>on</b> the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E
25|$|The next Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, was a success, {{and led to}} {{the fall}} of Gaza.

In 1918, the regiment took part in an unsuccessful raid across the River Jordan at Es <b>Salt.</b> <b>On</b> 21 September, the regiment captured Jenin and Sa'sa', and entered Damascus in October. The war in the Middle East ended shortly afterwards when the armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918. Afterwards, the regiment returned to Egypt to assist in putting down a revolt, before sailing for Australia in July 1919. The war cost the regiment over 100 per cent casualties, 190 killed and 481 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Frescoes demanded more {{complicated}} treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave {{a layer of}} residual <b>salt</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of the}} wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant efflorescence obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.|$|E

30|$|The {{effects of}} organic <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> 1, 3, 5 -trioxane {{synthesis}} were investigated through batch reaction and continuous production experiments. The organic salts used include sodium methanesulfonate (CH 3 NaO 3 S), sodium benzenesulfonate (C 6 H 5 NaO 3 S), sodium 4 -methylbenzenesulfonate (C 7 H 7 NaO 3 S), and sodium 3 -nitrobenzene sulfonate (C 6 H 4 NNaO 5 S). It was {{shown that the}} effects of organic <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane in reaction solution and distillate follow the order CH 3 NaO 3 S < C 6 H 5 NaO 3 S < C 7 H 7 NaO 3 S < C 6 H 4 NNaO 5 S, which is inversely related to the charge density of the anions of the organic salts. In comparison with Cl−-based salts such as magnesium chloride, organic salts have the advantages of less formic acid generation and low corrosion. Studies on water activity revealed that the effect of organic <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> the activity of water was quite small at low concentration of organic salts. UV–visible spectroscopy and vapor–liquid equilibrium experiments were performed to uncover the mechanisms that govern such effects. The results showed that the effect of organic <b>salts</b> <b>on</b> the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane relies primarily on their ability to increase the catalytic activity of sulfuric acid and increase the relative volatilities of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane and water and of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane and oligomers.|$|R
