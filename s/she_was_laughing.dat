During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at him, with a little, mock-caressive contempt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{ought to}} be {{squaring}} our accounts,' he thought--'looking things in the face. Something must be done; and here <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> and making everyone stare!' Done! But what could be done, {{when it was all}} like quicksand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{creature}} so well educated," [...] {{said the}} Duke, [...] "with the sense <b>she</b> <b>is</b> said to possess, would, rustic as <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> <b>laugh</b> at the assumed rants of Oroondates. It is the vein of Dorimont--once, Buckingham, thine own--that must here do the feat, besides that the part is easier." ...|$|R
60|$|Gavin {{looked at}} her sharply, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>laughing</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} {{half an hour}} later, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> {{and playing}} sweetly with her babe.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. Lora {{was sitting}} inside, {{talking to the}} clerk. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> rocking back and forth.|$|E
60|$|She half {{closed her}} eyes for a moment. When she looked at me again <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Loved her!" [...] cried Lorison, wildly. [...] "Never so well as now, {{though she}} told me she deceived and sinned and stole. Never more than now, when, perhaps, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at the fool she cajoled and left, with {{scarcely}} a word, to return to God only knows what particular line of her former folly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I marry her!" [...] Dobbin said, {{blushing}} very much, {{and talking}} quick. [...] "If {{you are so}} ready, young ladies, to chop and change, do you suppose that <b>she</b> <b>is?</b> <b>Laugh</b> and sneer at that angel. She can't hear it; and she's miserable and unfortunate, and deserves to <b>be</b> <b>laughed</b> at. Go on joking, Ann. You're the wit of the family, and the others like to hear it." ...|$|R
60|$|Roger frowned. Freda's {{face was}} solemn enough {{but her eyes}} looked as if <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|She toddled away, smiling, and Una {{turned to}} me. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> {{but there were}} tears in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|But the {{expression}} of her face made him stop. She was angry, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at the same time.|$|E
60|$|The Prince and Lady Carey {{descended the}} broad steps side by side. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> softly but immoderately. The Prince was pale with fury.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} that he could say. Whether <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> at him, as he thought to be most probable, or whether there was some grain of truth in the demand which she made, he found it equally {{impossible}} to make any reply. There {{was nothing that}} he could say; nor could he absolutely turn {{her out of the}} room. But after ten minutes' farther continuation of these amenities, during which it did at last come home to his brain that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> merely <b>laughing</b> at him, he began to think that he might possibly escape, and leave her there in possession of his chamber.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Clara Phillips, [s. d. ]. <b>She</b> can <b>be</b> seen from her chest up {{looking to the}} right. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> seated and has a large {{smile on her face}} as if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b> <b>She</b> can <b>be</b> seen wearing a jacket trimmed with lace or calico, and she appears to have a short hairstyle. The shoulder and arm of a man are visible in the right background...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Grosbeak, of course. Who {{else would}} it be?" [...] {{sputtered}} Jenny rather crossly, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{still a little}} put out because <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>laughed</b> at.|$|R
6000|$|... "She says so; {{and says}} that she {{declared}} that ten thousand pounds would be the very lowest sum. Of course <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at him." ...|$|E
60|$|The smile deepened slightly. Little lines {{appeared}} {{at the sides of}} her eyes. So far from being annoyed, he could see that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} him—he felt <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at his {{expression}} of face—and her laugh rang through the stately gardens. “What {{sort of a}} woman’s that?” ...|$|E
50|$|Five {{officers}} had complaints against them upheld, but all {{were allowed to}} remain in their jobs. This decision was criticised {{by one of the}} victims and her lawyers, who say that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at by the police when she reported her assault. Due to this case, the Metropolitan Police has created a central intelligence unit to investigate serial sex offenders.|$|R
60|$|Rilla, {{who still}} buttoned up {{her eyes when}} she went to sleep so that she always looked as if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> in her slumber, yawned, stretched, and smiled at Gertrude Oliver. The latter had come over from Lowbridge the {{previous}} evening and had been prevailed upon to remain for the dance at the Four Winds lighthouse the next night.|$|R
60|$|At other times, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of the meat chopper, I am an Indian brave, and then <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>Laughing</b> Water or Singing Sunshine, and we go out scalping together; or in less bloodthirsty moods I am the Fairy Prince and she the Sleeping Beauty. But in such parts <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not at her best. Better, when seated in the centre of the up-turned table, I am Captain Cook, and she the Cannibal Chief.|$|R
60|$|Teresa had {{suddenly}} turned away. Putting his hand lightly on her shoulder, {{the young man}} brought her {{face to face with}} him again. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} make out whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at him. He sat, not knowing what to say, and he blurted out, [...] "Do you mean that you won't?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{no matter}} how peculiarly {{constituted}} a man may be for blacksmithing," [...] <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> [...] "I never heard of one becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Robin relays Ted's {{ending of}} casual sex to Barney, <b>she</b> thinks Ted <b>was</b> {{afraid of getting}} hurt because he's too romantic. Barney confesses, saying [...] "I love you" [...] to Robin. Robin misunderstands and thinks he is imitating Ted. They go {{together}} for a meal, while Barney doesn't correct her. Barney gazes at Robin while <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughing,</b> and looks to Ted, who is okay with Barney's feelings for Robin.|$|R
50|$|Christopher likes Samantha {{and wants}} {{to ask her to}} the school prom. He is shy and {{concerned}} that Samantha may respond negatively. A social psychologist observes not only Samantha's behavior towards Christopher, but also how Christopher perceives and interprets her behavior toward him. An objective observer may perceive Samantha smiling as friendly, but Christopher may think that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at something in his appearance, and as a result, he might not invite her.|$|R

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her quite keenly. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at him with her eyes--an odd little trick of hers. He was himself again at once, and {{answered}} mendaciously, but with emphasis-- ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{feelings}} {{carried her}} away. She threw herself at his feet. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> and crying and talking incoherently, {{all at the}} same time. The Inspector assisted her to a chair.|$|E
6000|$|He {{realized}} that he had blundered when he saw the girl's face, but in another second <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> a little. [...] "No," [...] she said. [...] "I'm afraid you are forgetting." ...|$|E
60|$|Well might Geoffrey fear her! Elizabeth's {{sleep was}} that of a weasel. <b>She</b> too <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at this very moment, laughing, not loud but long--the laugh of one who wins.|$|R
