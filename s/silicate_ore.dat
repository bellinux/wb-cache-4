X-ray diffraction, chemical analyses, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated that nickel is associated with Ni-rich stevensite and to a lesser extent with Fe-rich montmorillonite. The crystal chemistry performed by FTIR spectroscopy revealed that Ni is present in the octahedral positions, substituting for Mg or Fe, which results in significant chemical and layer-charge heterogeneity in the samples.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the iron content in zinc {{silicate}} concentrates with either high (8 – 11 %) or low (3 %) iron does not significantly affect the kinetics or overall recovery of zinc extraction in sulphuric acid.

However, the leaching kinetics of these concentrates has received little attention. This work, therefore, addresses the leaching of a zinc silicate concentrate in sulphuric acid.

5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their <b>silicate</b> <b>ores,</b> all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride.

40|$|International audienceIn New Caledonian Ni deposits, {{the richest}} Ni {{silicate}} ores occur in fractures within the bedrock and saprolite, generally several tens of meters to hundred meters below the present-day surface. Fracture-related Ni <b>silicate</b> <b>ore</b> accounts for high Ni grades, {{at least a}} few weight percent above the average exploited grade (2. 5 %). These Ni-rich veins are affected by active dissolution-precipitation processes {{at the level of the}} water table. Ni in solution is precipitated as silicates in thin layer cementing joints. This mineralization is characterized by chemical and mineralogical concentric zoning with an outer green rim around an inner white zone composed, from the edge to the centre of the block, (i) a highly oxidized and altered zone, (ii) a green pure Ni-rich pimelite zone, (iii) a zone (limited to a few centimetres) with a mixture of Ni-poor kerolite and Ni-rich pimelite and intermediate colours and (iv) a large white Mg-kerolite mineralization zone. This study proposes that the concentric zonation results from evapo-precipitation process related to alternate periods of hydration and drying, induced by water table movements. This extensive dispersion of Ni in concentrically zoned ores can partly explain the rather monotonous Ni grade of the bulk exploitation at the base of the regolith with values between 2 and 3 wt%...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDetailed textural and mineralogical {{investigations}} {{carried out}} in mineralized veins of the New Caledonian peridotites reveal three major periods of infilling and alteration closely linked to post-obduction tectonic activity. The first two periods of infillings {{are related to the}} alteration of hydrothermal serpentines, mostly found in the thick serpentine network of the peridotites, into fine-grained serpentine-like residues and newly formed talc-like minerals of weak but variable swelling capacity. The alteration of serpentine into talc-like minerals is limited during the first period of infilling and almost completed during the second one. In some fault zones of the New Caledonian peridotites, talc-like minerals are replaced by sepiolite. Such alterations are reported in both the Ni-free and Ni-rich zones of the infillings (i. e. in the white `deweylite' and greenish `garnierite' of the fault zones, respectively). They led to the individualization of the hydrous Mg/Ni <b>silicate</b> <b>ore,</b> which is nowadays found in fractures of the saprock and saprolite units of thick lateritic profiles. The third and last period of infilling is assigned to the accumulation of silica and crystallization of quartz. This succession of clay minerals (serpentine-like and talc-like minerals, sepiolite) and quartz in the infillings is interpreted as the result of sequential exportation of Mg and redistribution of Ni along the reactivated faults, generating periods of increasing Si activity in solutions. In this paragenetic model, the meteoric water infiltrating repeatedly the permeable network created by post-obduction tectonic activity would have interacted with a low-temperature hydrothermal field following the exhumation and cooling of the ophiolite nappe. In the less permeable parts of the fault network, restricted leaching conditions would have generated greater alkalinity in solutions and therefore favored the crystallization of sepiolite instead of finely divided talc-like minerals...|$|E

Samples were collected either from west block or Petea block. The west block is mostly occupied by unserpentinised peridotite, whereas the east block represented by Petea area is covered by moderately to highly serpentinized protolith. The field observation and microscopic analysis indicate that the garnierites in the west block occur in the three modes; i) slickensided fault coating, ii) the fracture-filled veins, and iii) matrices in conglomeratic peridotite. While in Petea area, the garnierite is only found as vein filling fractures. Results of XRD analysis exhibit that garnierite from Soroako is mainly composed of kerolite-pimellite, talc-willemseite, Ni-serpentine, and sepiolite-falcondoite series. Nickel content of the garnierite samples studied by means of XRF methods ranges from 1. 8 to 19. 2 wt%. The wide variation of Ni content in the analyzed garnierite samples is likely caused by the presence gangue minerals particularly of quartz/silica and trace amount of iron oxide...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} technology (MCT) {{involves the}} safe long term storage of stable and carbonated products, mainly carbonates and bicarbonates. The carbonation of candidate feedstock comprising calcium and magnesium silicates is relatively slow, is energy intensive. Processing involves {{the handling of}} significant quantities of materials.

The combining of CO 2 with various silicates is estimated to cost between US 54 and US 250 per tonne of CO 2.

In addition to naturally abundant silicates, an alternative approach could be the waste carbonation technology (WCT) of alkaline residues.

40|$|Capture {{and storage}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) is internationally {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the main options for reducing atmospheric emissions of CO 2. In Finland, no suitable geological formations are known to exist for storing captured CO 2. However, fixing CO 2 as solid carbonates using silicate-based materials is an interesting alternative. The magnesium silicate deposits in Eastern Finland alone could be sufficient for storing 10 Mt CO 2 each year during a period of 200 - 300 years. Finnish steelmaking slags could also be carbonated, but the amounts produced provide a much smaller potential for CO 2 storage (0. 5 Mt CO 2 per year) than magnesium silicates provide. The aim of this thesis was to study the possibility of reducing CO 2 emissions by producing calcium and magnesium carbonates from silicate materials for the long-term storage of CO 2 using multi-step processes. The production of carbonates from steelmaking slags and serpentinite, a magnesium <b>silicate</b> <b>ore</b> available from a metal-mining site, was studied both experimentally and theoretically. On the basis of the results, process concepts were developed and evaluated. Finally, the stability of synthetic calcium and magnesium carbonates as a medium for CO 2 storage was assessed. Experiments with aqueous extraction and precipitation processes showed that magnesium and calcium can easily be extracted from steelmaking slags and natural silicate minerals using acids. Natural minerals seem to demand stronger acids for extraction than slags. Relatively pure calcium carbonate (80 - 90 % calcite) was produced at room temperature and a CO 2 pressure of 1 bar by adding sodium hydroxide to acetate solutions made from slag. Similarly, serpentinite was successfully converted into 93 - 100 % pure hydromagnesite (a magnesium carbonate), using nitric acid or hydrochloric acid for the dissolution of serpentinite and sodium hydroxide for precipitation. The conversion of raw material to carbonate ranged from 60 - 90 %. Although the results show that pure carbonates can be produced from industrial by-products and mining residues, the process concept suggested requires the recycling of large amounts of sodium hydroxide and acid, as well as low-grade heat for solvent evaporation. The methods suggested for recovering the spent chemicals were found to be expensive and cause more CO 2 emissions than the amount of CO 2 stored...|$|E

Samples of the high-grade Greek Kastoria nickel laterite were leached with sulphuric acid and a number of organic acids. Sulphuric and citric acids extracted over 60 and 40 % of the contained nickel, respectively, but the other acids employed were less efficient leachants. Oxalic acid precipitated nickel oxalate. Roughly the same extraction of iron was observed. The main leaching parameter was confirmed to be hydrogen ion concentration, although complexation with organic anions was a contributor. Organism F 1 (a strain of Penicillium) was used in comparison with organisms from various culture collections to bioleach nickel from samples of the low-grade Greek Litharakia nickel laterite. The organisms were cultivated in a mixture of a sugar-based nutrient mineral medium and finely ground ore. Several penicillia and aspergilli leached 55 - 60 % of the contained nickel and cobalt, and 25 - 35 % of the iron when sucrose was the carbon source, but Fl was not efficient. However, in molasses medium, Fl extracted nearly 40 % of the nickel. Biosorption and bioprecipitation reactions were observed. The mechanism of bioleaching or in situ leaching is discussed in terms of close physical and chemical association between the fungal hyphae and mineral phases in the ore.

It is well known for its purity and size and its origin has been the subject of an intense debate for over a century. The composition of the most important minerals from an economic point of view, magnetite and apatite, has been well studied but little is known about the composition and role of the silicate minerals. Nowadays, even the silicates have been targeted for investigations, both in Kiirunavaara and in similar deposits elsewhere, e. g., Sierra la Banderra, Chile. The growing interest derives mainly from the importance of the gangue minerals in ore processing but also because they might hold the key to the origin of the ores.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study of nickel-bearing hydrous silicates has been funded by European Nickel Plc. and Loughborough University, {{with support from the}} Natural History Museum, London. European Nickel Plc., the industrial sponsors of the project, is a nickel mining company based in the UK with mine sites around the globe including Turkey, Albania and the Philippines. European Nickel developed a process of nickel extraction for lateritic ore deposits known as atmospheric heap-leach (AHL). This new technique is not only economically favourable to more traditional nickel extraction methods, with relatively low plant and process costs, but it is also more environmentally responsible with lower CO 2 emissions. These factors make AHL an attractive choice for new nickel extraction ventures. However, speed, efficiency and percentage recovery of nickel have proven to be variable across mined ore bodies using this technique. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} lateritic ores, particularly nickel-bearing hydrous <b>silicate</b> <b>ores,</b> are poorly understood. To develop the extraction process and understand the variability inherent to the AHL process thus requires a greater understanding of the ore types, more specifically of their chemistry. This project has been undertaken to develop the understanding of these materials and has done so by focusing on two main themes. The first focus was on the characterisation of a suite of natural mineral samples, to broaden the understanding of the types of phases present in lateritic material. Samples were sourced from nickel-laterite mine sites across the globe and historical collections at the Natural History Museum, London. Characterisation of the materials was initiated with powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies, using both standard laboratory and synchrotron-based instruments. PXRD studies allowed a database of mineral phases to be compiled and common groups and themes to be identified. This found that serpentine (Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4), talc (Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2) and quartz (SiO 2) were the most significant phases in these types of material. Following the PXRD studies, a selection of specimens samples were then investigated further using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). EPMA data allowed compositional information to be incorporated in context. This complementary information further emphasised the importance of talc and serpentine phases to the study, with nickel substitution most common and at the highest levels in these phases. Nickel-bearing talc was observed with up to 39. 89 wt. ...|$|R

40|$|The Cheshin meta-calcareous rocks (Permo Triassic) in {{southeast}} Hamedan outcrop {{in association with}} a variety of pelitic schists and hornfels rocks. The intrusion of the Alvand Batholith (Jurassic age) into pelitic and calcareous host rocks has produced metamorphic rocks in the Hamedan area (Cheshin village). On the basis of the dominance of calcite/dolomite, <b>silicate</b> and <b>ore</b> minerals, the calcareous rocks can be divided into two groups: a) marbles and calc-silicates; b) skarn rocks. The ore bodies occur in a contact zone between sillimanite-hornfels and calc-silicate rocks and formed the skarn rocks. Based on mineralogy, skarn rocks in the studied area consist mainly of diopside, garnet, tremolite, vesuvianite, epidote and ore minerals (magnetite and hematite). The skarnification processes occurred at two stages: (1) prograde metamorphism; and (2) retrograde metamorphism. The first stage involved prograde metasomatism and anhydrous minerals such as garnet and pyroxene formed. Second stage of retrograde skarn development is also recognized. In addition to Fe, Si and Mg, substantial amounts of Fe, along with volatile components were added to the skarn system. Consequently, considerable amounts of hydrous minerals, oxides and carbonates replaced the anhydrous minerals in the host rocks and hydrous minerals such as epidote+chlorite+amphibole formed. Using multiple equilibria by THERMOCALC® program, temperature (630 ºC), pressure (4 kbar), and fluid composition (XCO 2 as low as 0. 17) have been calculated for the formation of the calc-silicate rocks. Skarn mineralogy shows good agreement with these calculations. ...|$|R
40|$|The Campiglia Marittima Fe-Cu-Zn-Pb(-Ag) skarn deposit is {{of small}} size (∼ 50 kt of base metals) and medium/low-grade (1. 4 % Cu; 3. 8 % Zn; 2. 0 % Pb) with modest {{economic}} interest but its geological characteristics (e. g., spatial association with magmatic rocks, textural features of primary <b>silicate</b> minerals, <b>ore</b> bodies shape, etc) {{make it an}} ideal site to study skarn- and ore-forming processes. The present PhD thesis contributes to the debate on processes of skarn formation providing detailed field data integrated with petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical-isotopic data of the Campiglia Marittima magmatic-hydrothermal system. This locality offers also the opportunity to study the tridimensional shape of the geological bodies, thanks to past underground mining activities (during almost three millennia of ore exploitation), with additional data derived from about 25 km of drillholes. The results of this PhD work led to a deep review of the classical Campiglia Marittima exoskarn model and suggest an alternative holistic model {{for the development of}} skarn and ore bodies in the regional-local tectono-magmatic setting. The magmatic-hydrothermal and ore temporal sequence, together with a unifying tectonic-magmatic-metasomatic model proposed for Campiglia Marittima area can be used elsewhere as a guide in defining possible targets for ore and geothermal exploration. In addition to the scientific purposes, the results of this thesis have been and will be made availble also for tourists and laymen with no significant geological background by means of specific publications, conferences and mineralogical exhibitions, in the framework of a fruitful cooperation between the Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra (University of Pisa), the Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse of Pisa (CNR) and the Parchi Val di Cornia S. p.

40|$|Revegetation on mine {{sites and}} mine wastes in Western Australia {{commonly}} {{has to deal}} with salt-affected substrates (the generic term substrate includes soils, saprolite, overburden and residues, all of which can be media for plant growth on mine sites) for plant growth. However, the origin of the salt is varied: so too are the treatments to ameliorate the salt-affected substrates for successful revegetation. Salts occur in high concentrations in the wastes from bauxite and gold mining in Western Australia. These mining operations exploit <b>silicate</b> based <b>ores</b> and rely on the chemical extraction of finely ground ore with sodium hydroxide followed in the case of gold ores with sodium cyanide treatment. Thus the process waters which are continually recycled, contain high sodium concentrations and the residue is salt-affected. In addition, in a number of the operations, saline groundwater (e. g. Kaltails operation in the eastern Goldfields) or run-off water (e. g. gold mining operations in the eastern Darling Range) is used in the processing, adding further salt to the process cycle. Apart from the introduction of salts into the process waters, many of the topsoils, subsoils, overburdens, saprolite substrates and waste materials present at mine sites contain sodium salts since nearly one-third of Australian soils are salt-affected (Northcote and Skene 1968). Thus salt constraints will need to be considered in many areas by those attempting revegetation after mining. Salt-affected substrates may suffer from one or more of three conditions: salinity, sodicity and alkalinity. Each has its own special constraints and particular requirements for management or alleviation. In this paper, we will consider each type of salt-affected land and the role of gypsum, calcium sulphate, in its amelioration with particular reference to mine wastes...|$|R
40|$|A section through Archeart {{nickel-iron}} sulfide mineralization of Western Mining Corporation's Lunnon Shoot, Kambalda, {{consists of}} a footwall of pillow basalt, a narrow contact zone comprising magnetite-rimmed chromite enhedra in <b>silicates,</b> massive <b>ore</b> with 95 percent sulfide, matrix (disseminated) ore with 60 - 20 percent sulfide, and hy-drated and carbonated ultramafic rocks in the hanging wall. The sulfides were selectively dissolved for analysis using a bromine attack (see Appendix) giving an average com-position of the sulfide portion of Ni = 9. 37 %, Fe- 50. 56 %, Cu = 0. 87 %, Co = 0. 20 % and S = 39. 01 %. The major sulfides are pyrrhotite, pentlandite (with minor alteration to violarite), pyrite and chalcopyrite. The pyrite is concentrated {{near the top of}} the massive ore. Magnetite is irregularly distributed through the ore, and is more abundant in the matrix ore than in the massive ore. The data are consistent with the ore having been eraplaced at elevated temperatures as an ultramafic crystal mush containing olivine and chromite crystals, magnesia-rich sili-cate melt and immiscible sulfide-oxide liquid. Gravity segregation, probably in flow. has resulted in an ore zone comprising a quenched chromite-bearing zone, a sulfide-rich massive ore zone and a matrix ore in which olivines were set in continuous sulfide. The hanging wall represents the original silicate crystal mush with only minor sulfides. Solidification of sulfide commenced at about 1, 140 ø C near the contact, resulting in magnetite-poor massive ore and oxide-enriched matrix ore. Pyrite was the first sub-solidus sulfide mineral to crystallize at about 400 ø C and grew to give bands and subhedra {{near the top of the}} massive ore (with rejected Ni and Fe diffusing away). Cobalt was preferentially concentrated in this pyrite and depleted from the surrounding sulfide (Mss). Pentlandite exsolving at lower temperatures, however, competed favorably with late-forming pyrite for available cobalt. Nickel is low in the early-formed pyrite but concentrated in pyrite formed at low temperatures...|$|R

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. A large proportion of ores in magmatic sulfide deposits consist of mixtures of cumulus silicate minerals, sulfide liquid and silicate melt, with characteristic textural relationships that provide essential clues to their origin. Within silicate-sulfide cumulates, there is a range of sulfide abundance in magmatic-textured silicate-sulfide ores between ores with up to about five modal percent sulfides, called “disseminated ores”, and “net-textured” (or “matrix”) ores containing about 30 to 70 modal percent sulfide forming continuous networks enclosing cumulus <b>silicates.</b> Disseminated <b>ores</b> in cumulates have a variety of textural types relating to {{the presence or absence of}} trapped interstitial silicate melt and (rarely) vapour bubbles. Spherical or oblate spherical globules with smooth menisci, as in the Black Swan disseminated ores, are {{associated with}} silicate-filled cavities interpreted as amygdales or segregation vesicles. More irregular globules lacking internal differentiation and having partially facetted margins are interpreted as entrainment of previously segregated, partially solidified sulfide. There is a textural continuum between various types of disseminated and net-textured ores, intermediate types commonly taking the form of “patchy net-textured ores” containing sulfide-rich and sulfide-poor domains at cm to dm scale. These textures are ascribed primarily to the process of sulfide percolation, itself triggered by the process of competitive wetting whereby the silicate melt preferentially wets silicate crystal surfaces. The process is self-reinforcing as sulfide migration causes sulfide networks to grow by coalescence, with a larger rise height and hence a greater gravitational driving force for percolation and silicate melt displacement. Many of the textural variants catalogued here, including poikilitic or leopard-textured ores, can be explained in these terms. Additional complexity is added by factors such as the presence of oikocrysts and segregation of sulfide liquid during strain-rate dependent thixotropic behaviour of partially consolidated cumulates. Integrated textural and geochemical studies are critical to full understanding of ore-forming systems. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|A thermo-chronological {{analysis}} of the Bartlet basement unit (French Massif Central) reveals a four-stage history. Peak metamorphism (650 °C and 7 kbar) was followed by retrograde growth of albite blasts {{and development of the}} main foliation at 600 °C, and chloritization of the ferromagnesian minerals. The third stage is a marked reversal of cooling, with recrossing of the biotite isograd and local reappearance of garnet at 450 °C. This thermal event, inferred to result from hot fluid infiltration, is also recognized in the adjacent basin of Langeae, where it gives rise to anomalous coal grades (recording 200 ° at 1 km). A Stephanian age for this event correlates with a regional thermal event recognized throughout the Variscan, where it has been linked to delamination of the continental crust. This work represents the first instance in the Massif Central that recognizes this event in the shallow basement itself. Final cooling is accompanied by extensive fluid-induced sericitization, starting immediately after the peak of the thermal event and continuing to temperatures inferred for Sb-As ore deposition. This continuum leads us to conclude that reheating-related <b>silicate</b> reactions and <b>ore</b> deposition are caused by the same fluid and related to the wider regional Variscan thermal event...|$|R
