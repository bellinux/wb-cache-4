There was, however, a smooth, dark strip between, and she followed it, shouldering off a spangled wash, with the propeller beating <b>slow.</b> <b>Ahead,</b> a low, hazy blur rose out of the sea, and when Grahame spoke to the captain the windlass began to clank and indistinct figures became busy on the forecastle.

Then Lindstrom sprang out of the galley with a blue light in his hand, and its radiance blazed wind-flung and intense on the narrowing gap of foam between the two wildly rolling hulls. There was a hoarse shouting, and, though he might not have heard the words, it was evident that the man on board the schooner realized what he was expected to do.

6000|$|She {{came into}} the Cove (as {{that part of the}} harbour is called), of course very slowly, and at some hundred feet or so short of the quay she lost her way. That quay was then a wooden one, a fine {{structure}} of mighty piles and stringers bearing a roadway--a thing of great strength. The ship, as I have said before, stopped moving when some hundred feet from it. Then her engines were rung on <b>slow</b> <b>ahead,</b> and immediately rung off again. The propeller made just about five turns, I should say. She began to move, stealing on, so to speak, without a ripple; coming alongside with the utmost gentleness. I went on looking her over, very much interested, but the man with me, the pilot, muttered under his breath: [...] "Too much, too much." [...] His exercised judgment had warned him of what I did not even suspect. But I believe that neither of us was exactly prepared for what happened. There was a faint concussion of the ground under our feet, a groaning of piles, a snapping of great iron bolts, and with a sound of ripping and splintering, as when a tree is blown down by the wind, a great strong piece of wood, a baulk of squared timber, was displaced several feet as if by enchantment. I looked at my companion in amazement. [...] "I could not have believed it," [...] I declared. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "You would not have thought she would have cracked an egg--eh?" ...|$|E

That was the ship Zaporozhye, GRT 2000 approximately, under the command of captain L. M.

The command [...] "full speed astern" [...] were given on both ships for 2-3 minutes before collision, but was not possible to snub the ships and Karaganda, having considerable inertia of moving forward, hit the port side board of the ship Zaporozhye by own left foreword quarter and by the left anchor at 01 hours 16 minutes. The Zaporozhye sank rapidly after 28 minutes due to list was increased rapidly to the port side. The Karaganda suffered a lot of damage to the bow part of the hull. Due to correct actions of the captain of the Zaporozhye after the collision, who took all demanded measures setting for the salvation of all 54 crew members as well as the ship's papers and money, the abandonment of the sinking ship was organized without panic and in compliance with good maritime traditions. The watch sailor was risking own life when he hacked the jammed door of the chief mate's cabin and released the chief officer before the sinking vessel. There were no victims after the collision of two ships and the loss of one of them.|$|E

40|$|One {{step ahead}} {{optimization}} has been recently proposed for spacecraft attitude maneuvers {{as well as}} for robot manipulator maneuvers. Such a technique yields a discrete time control algorithm implementable as a sequence of state-dependent, quadratic programming problems for acceleration optimization. Its sensitivity to model accuracy, for the required inversion of the system dynamics, is shown in this paper to be alleviated by a fast variable structure control correction, acting between the sampling intervals of the <b>slow</b> one step <b>ahead</b> discrete time acceleration command generation algorithm. The slow and fast looping concept chosen follows that recently proposed for optimal aiming strategies with variable structure control. Accelerations required by the VSC correction are reserved during the <b>slow</b> one step <b>ahead</b> command generation so that the ability to overshoot the sliding surface is guaranteed...|$|R

While the growth rates in housing variables appeared to <b>slow</b> <b>ahead</b> of city-level peaks, we find no consistent statistical relationship suggesting a city's permits or prices influences its business cycle. In fact, we find that national permits are a better leading indicator for a city's employment than a city's own permits.

40|$|A {{previously}} unidentified type {{of solar}} wind forward-reverse shock pair {{has been observed}} by Ulysses at 4. 64 AU and S 32. 5 deg. In contrast to most solar wind forward-reverse shock pairs, which are driven by the speed difference between fast solar wind plasma and <b>slower</b> plasma <b>ahead,</b> this particular shock pair was driven purely by the over-expansion of a coronal mass ejection (CME) in transit from the Sun. A simple numerical simulation indicates that the over-expansion {{was a result of}} a high initial internal plasma and magnetic field pressure within the CME. The CME observed at 4. 64 AU had the internal field structure of a magnetic flux rope. This event was associated with a solar disturbance in which new magnetic loops formed in the corona almost directly beneath Ulysses approximately 11 days earlier. This association suggests that the flux rope was created as a result of reconnection between the 'legs' of neighboring magnetic loops within the rising CME...|$|R
40|$|Work zone {{intelligent}} {{transportation systems}} (WZITSs) have been promoted {{as a way}} to improve safety and reduce congestion at work zone locations where traditional traffic management centers do not exist. These systems usually integrate portable changeable message signs and speed sensors with a central control system that automatically determines appropriate messages based on current traffic conditions. Manufacturers of these systems claim that WZITSs can warn drivers of downstream congestion, alert drivers of <b>slower</b> speeds <b>ahead,</b> and suggest alternate routes based on prevailing conditions. Transportation agencies are often asked to make a decision on the installation of a WZITS without the benefit of objective information on its expected performance. A relatively small number of operational tests of these systems have been performed, and their results are not always well documented or conclusive. Agencies need guidance to help them determine whether a WZITS system may improve safety and operations at a specific site.
