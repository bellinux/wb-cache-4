25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from <b>social</b> <b>intervention</b> in India.|$|E

Decentralization of <b>social</b> <b>interventions</b> in Albania is a condition that can fully develop democratic process in the country. The idea of decentralization of <b>social</b> <b>interventions</b> aimed at promotion of a complex cooperation between different levels of government- State, Regions, Municipalities / Communes- to continuously operate to promote wider participation of citizens and social organizations in national and local government elections. Description of the current situation of decentralization, problems, achievements and providing social services in Albania, will be analyzed in this article. Innovative ideas on decentralization to disclose responsibilities, built on rules that make transparent decisions will guarantee the proper use of resources and a careful verification of the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions. Only a democratic process of this magnitude enables intelligent activation and available resources to support the difficult process to build an integrated system of social services. It is required to overcome the perception that <b>social</b> <b>interventions</b> are considered only as an expense but should be considered as an investment in human resources.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of sociological and anthropological {{literature}} recognizes 'street children' as a socially constructed category. Social policy research highlights the dynamic and political nature of policy-to-intervention processes. Children who live on urban streets ostensibly benefit {{from a range of}} <b>social</b> <b>interventions,</b> but street children as targets of social policy are under-researched. This thesis explores experiences of 'street' children in their take-up of <b>social</b> <b>Interventions</b> and the policies that lie behind them. Adopting a layered case study approach, focused on Puebla City, Mexico, between 2002 and 2005, I used qualitative research methods (interviews, observation, documentation) to build a rich picture of social policy processes through exploring experiences of 24 street-living children, families, service providers and policy-makers. This thesis argues that government research and policies relating to Puebla City constructed simplistic notions of 'street children' as children whose lives play out on the streets. My findings suggested public spaces occupied a limited part of children's lives while street-living children and their families remained connected, but <b>social</b> <b>interventions</b> proved resistant to reuniting them. Specialist NGO interventions appeared to provide a better 'fit' for street-living children and families than interventions designed for larger populations of vulnerable or deviant children. Unregulated self-help groups were left, unsuccessfully, to bridge the gap of treatment for child substance abuse. My thesis suggests that social policy processes construct and then deconstruct 'street children' to fit available <b>social</b> <b>interventions,</b> disregarding children's experiences and outcomes, forcing street-living children (round pegs) into <b>social</b> <b>interventions</b> designed for other populations (square holes). This distorts higher order policy goals with the stated aim of including children in mainstream society; with the illusory benefit of saving resources in the short term but with further exclusionary effects for street-living children. Recommendations include recognizing children as service end-users, and acknowledging families and service providers as key stakeholders...|$|R
