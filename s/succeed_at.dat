5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman {{but he was}} not {{a prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers to a lack of single-mindedness required to <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, Shaughnessy {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} return to Maryland amidst mounting criticism at Pittsburgh, which included the threat of resignation from assistant coaches Charles Hartwig, Bobby Hoel and Stan Olenn. University of Maryland president Dr. H. C. Byrd, himself a former football coach, called Shaughnessy one of the top-three coaches in the nation. Shaughnessy complained {{that he was not}} given a fair chance to <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> Pittsburgh and that controversy over his role with the Redskins was without basis. The Pittsburgh athletic board had recommended Shaughnessy be retained as coach if he resigned from the Redskins, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|Debegri {{attempts}} to subdue Tlanth under {{the pretense of}} unpaid taxes and for conspiring to break the Covenant. Mel and Bran and their small group of forces – mostly farmers and tradespeople – initially <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war changes for the worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), {{the heir to the}} nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna-city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution. Mel refuses, and soon escapes imprisonment with the help of their family spy, Azmus.|$|E

5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|Trump {{supports}} Kiyosaki's view on {{the learning}} opportunity created by failure, writing, students who {{rise to the top}} of the class academically are not always those who <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> entrepreneurship. He writes this is due to a fear of failure, and ascribes business success to the experience of learning from failures. Trump compares this to the business sector, writing that those who have learned from failures in business simultaneously learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. He differentiates between practical intelligence and academic intelligence.|$|E

25|$|The work failed: it is {{the general}} view that Milton's work did not <b>succeed,</b> <b>at</b> {{least in terms of}} rebutting the Eikon Basilike. On the other hand, {{scholars}} still debate exactly what the polemic intention of Milton's work was. This book was the first work by Milton to be at all widely read. Public sentiment still supported Charles I, but the tract was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{international}} breakthrough, Vainio {{was one of}} {{the potential}} gold medal candidates prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics. Vainio was also known for his tough training programs, and during the winter 1980 he ran as many as over 300 kilometres per week during his four-month-long training camp in New Zealand. Presumably, that was too much and due to overtraining and some unspecified stomach problems, Vainio did not <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, finishing 13th in the 10,000 metres final and 11th in the 5,000 metres final.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films, Chan became {{frustrated}} with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the filmmaking process. In response to Golden Harvest's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG). His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> the box office; examples include New Police Story (2004), The Myth (2005) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood (2006).|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 reboot, the Prince {{gets lost}} in a {{sandstorm}} and falls into a valley where he encounters Elika. The prince soon aids Elika in her quest to contain the dark god Ahriman in the Tree of Life {{at the center of}} the valley. They ultimately fail, but make every effort to lock Ahriman back into the tree. They <b>succeed</b> <b>at</b> this, but Elika dies. The prince, mirroring the actions of Elika's father which originally released Ahriman, decides to bring Elika back to life, freeing Ahriman once again. Ahriman chases them to an underground palace, where Elika ultimately abandons the prince in search of her people.|$|E
