5|$|During the 2001 season, Culbreth {{received}} {{an email from}} then-MLB official Sandy Alderson advising the umpire {{that he was not}} calling enough <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> that if he did not make adjustments, he would face criticism from ESPN analysts when he umpired a game that was broadcast by the network.|$|E
5|$|Multiple Unions {{across the}} city {{declared}} sympathy <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> joined the growing crowd. Between 8,000 and 10,000 rioters flooded Illinois Street, the main business district of the city, lighting fires, destroying property, and attacking people.|$|E
5|$|The Parisian bid {{suffered}} two setbacks {{during the}} inspection: {{a number of}} <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> demonstrations coincided with the visit, and a report was released stating that Guy Drut, IOC member {{and one of the}} key members of Paris's bid team, faced charges over alleged political party financial corruption.|$|E

50|$|The <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> protests {{proceeded}} without violent incident. Ali {{announced the}} BNP would stage other events, {{such as a}} human chain, hunger <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> grand rally at Amalshid, where the Barak River enters Bangladesh.|$|R
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 1907 precipitated a major crisis in Brazil's civil {{aviation}} system, which included massive flight delays and cancellations, {{air traffic controller}} work-to-rule slowdowns and <b>strikes,</b> <b>and</b> public safety concerns about Brazil's airport and air traffic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The protest {{movement}} {{spread to}} other cities, leading to more <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for December 21, 1970.|$|E
5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E
50|$|On July 11, Police Local 1195 (also {{affiliated}} with AFSCME) voted to <b>strike,</b> <b>and</b> most {{officers on the}} night shift walked off. The walkout added urgency to the <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> the magnified national attention directed towards it.|$|R
50|$|These {{events are}} {{set against a}} {{backdrop}} of civil unrest. The students at Watanabe's college go on <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> call for a revolution. Inexplicably, the students end their <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> act as if nothing had happened, which enrages Watanabe as a sign of hypocrisy.|$|R

5|$|Chotiner {{served as}} counsel to state {{committees}} investigating violence in motion picture <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> conditions in children's boarding homes and in {{homes for the}} elderly. In 1944, Chotiner {{was elected president of}} the conservative California Republican Assembly, a grassroots organization of party activists; he had previously {{served as president of the}} Los Angeles Republican Assembly. In addition to his political involvement, he was active in the Los Angeles Jewish Community Relations Committee.|$|E
5|$|Complying with Eighth Army's {{order for}} a spoiling attack against the North Koreans {{northwest}} of Taegu, Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518. Situated north of the lateral Waegwan-Tabu–dong road, and about midway between the two towns, it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places. After securing Hill 518, the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314. Air <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player <b>strikes,</b> <b>and</b> the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{representing}} <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> dip is by dip and dip direction. The dip direction is the azimuth {{of the direction}} the dip as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90° off the strike angle. For example, a bed dipping 30° to the South, would have an East-West <b>strike</b> (<b>and</b> would be written 090°/30° S using <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> dip), but would be written as 30/180 using the dip and dip direction method.|$|R

5|$|Generally {{a friend}} of {{organized}} labor, Chandler supported miners' efforts to unionize, organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs. He also endorsed the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the federal constitution and secured passage of a state anti-child-labor law {{that had previously been}} defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins. However, he opposed closed shops and sitdown <b>strikes,</b> <b>and</b> utilized the Kentucky National Guard to quell labor-related violence in Harlan County.|$|E
5|$|Loitering weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.|$|E
5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E

5|$|Ruling by decree, the RCC {{maintained}} the monarchy's ban on political parties, in May 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers' <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> suspended newspapers. In September 1971, Gaddafi resigned, {{claiming to be}} dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but returned to his position within a month. In February 1973, he resigned again, once more returning the following month.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{loitering}} {{weapons have}} been developed for additional roles beyond the initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> fire support down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use such as the AeroVironment Switchblade which is deployed at the platoon level and fits in a backpack. A documented use of loitering munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down <b>strikes,</b> <b>and</b> large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E

5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson taking {{the center of}} the cage as Silva circled outside. Jackson opened the action with an {{overhand}} right, and immediately moved backwards. Both fighters appeared cautious for the opening minutes of the fight, exchanging <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> quickly moving away. Silva focused on leg kicks, while Jackson focused on working the jab.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
