5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine {{amendments to}} the constitution in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed opening up the Constitution and inserting <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into {{the main body of the}} Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5000|$|In brief, Khorasani firstly {{considers}} {{judgment as}} a <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> for jurisprudents; secondly, {{he does not}} regard legislation as an obligation for jurisprudents, but their supervision over legislation as necessary, so that no law enters a religious society against the religion; and thirdly, he denies <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> for jurisprudents to manage the public domain. Absolute rejection of jurisprudents' <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> to manage the public domain {{makes it possible for}} all people to participate. On this basis, Khorasani announces his historical saying: [...] "In Imam Mahdi's occultation, government belongs to the public". This statement is seen by Iranian scholars as the foundation of democracy in an Islamic society.|$|R

Typical questions have a <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> answer (such as [...] "What is {{the capital of}} Canada?"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as [...] "What {{is the meaning of}} life?"). Recent works have looked at even more complex questions.|$|R
25|$|In May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) {{affirmed that}} {{indigenous}} people (also termed aboriginal people, native people, or autochthonous people) are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation {{as having a}} set of <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development, and or occupation of a region. The session affirms that since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by politically dominant, different ethnic groups, special protection of individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions, are entitled to special protection.|$|E
25|$|Certain <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> {{apply in}} {{criminal}} cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of the Constitution, {{known as}} Federalists, opposed {{a bill of}} rights for much of the {{ratification}} period, in part due to the procedural uncertainties it would create. Madison argued against such an inclusion, suggesting that state governments were sufficient guarantors of personal liberty, in No. 46 of The Federalist Papers, a series of essays promoting the Federalist position. Hamilton opposed {{a bill of rights}} in The Federalist No. 84, stating that [...] "the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights. He stated that ratification did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, making protections unnecessary: [...] "Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain everything, they have no need of particular reservations." [...] Patrick Henry criticized the federalist point of view, writing that the legislature must be firmly informed [...] "of the extent of the rights retained by the people ... being in a state of uncertainty, they will assume rather than give up powers by implication." [...] Other anti-federalists pointed out that earlier political documents, in particular the Magna Carta had protected <b>specific</b> <b>rights.</b> In response, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different: ...|$|E

5000|$|If a {{landlord}} promises the tenant {{that he will}} not exercise his right to terminate a lease, and relying upon that promise the tenant spends money improving the premises, the doctrine of promissory estoppel may prevent the landlord from exercising a right to terminate, even though his promise might not otherwise have been legally binding as a contract. The landlord is precluded from asserting a <b>specific</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R

Based on such evidence, ministers of education endorse a sustainable pedagogy {{for the future}} that does not separate play from learning but brings them together to promote creativity in future generations. In fact, play {{is considered to be}} so essential to healthy development that the United Nations has recognized it as a <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> for all children.|$|R
2500|$|Citizenship of the United States is {{a status}} that entails <b>specific</b> <b>rights,</b> duties and benefits.

Both the Interim Constitution, which came into force on 27 April 1994, and the final Constitution, which replaced it on 4 February 1997, forbid {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex, gender or sexual orientation. These equality rights formed the basis for a series of court decisions granting <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> to couples in long-term same-sex relationships: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1940s and 1960s the Supreme Court {{gradually}} {{issued a}} series of decisions incorporating several of the <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> from the Bill of Rights, {{so as to be}} binding upon the States. A dissenting school of thought championed by Justice Hugo Black supported that incorporation of <b>specific</b> <b>rights,</b> but urged incorporation of all <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> instead of just some of them. Black was for so-called mechanical incorporation, or total incorporation, of Amendments 1 through 8 of the Bill of Rights (Amendments 9 and 10 being patently connected to the powers of the state governments). Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment required the States to respect all of the enumerated rights set forth in the first eight amendments, but he did not wish to see the doctrine expanded to include other, unenumerated [...] "fundamental rights" [...] that might be based on the Ninth Amendment. Black felt that his formulation eliminated any arbitrariness or caprice in deciding what the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect, by sticking to words already found in the Constitution. Although Black was willing to invalidate federal statutes on federalism grounds, he was not inclined to read any of the first eight amendments as states' rights provisions as opposed to individual rights provisions. Justice Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to apply the first eight amendments from the Bill of Rights to the states, as he expressed in his dissenting opinion in Adamson v. California. This view was again expressed by Black in his concurrence in Duncan v. Louisiana citing the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause: [...] "'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another general {{approach}} to interpreting Charter rights {{is to consider}} international legal precedents with countries that have <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> protections, such as the United States Bill of Rights (an influence on aspects of the Charter) and the Constitution of South Africa. However, international precedent is only of guiding value, and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American Bill of Rights as being [...] "born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances." ...|$|E
50|$|In much of Europe, {{controls}} on persons were abolished by the 1985 Schengen Agreement and subsequent European Union legislation. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the competence to pass laws on crossing {{internal and external}} borders within the European Union and the associated Schengen Area states (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein) lies exclusively within {{the jurisdiction of the}} European Union, except where states have used a <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> to opt out (United Kingdom and Ireland, which maintain the Common Travel Area amongst themselves).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the constitutional guarantee, various state and federal statutes confer a more <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> to a speedy trial. In New York, the prosecution must be [...] "ready for trial" [...] within six months on all felonies except murder, or the charges are dismissed by action of law {{without regard to the}} merits of the case. This is also known as a [...] "ready rule". [...] In California courts, defendants have a right to a trial within 45 days.|$|R
5000|$|Some states make a {{distinction}} between a mistake as to the substance and effect of existing laws, and a mistake that the law creates a <b>specific</b> <b>right</b> to act in the particular way. [...] In Chamberlain v Lindon 1998 Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right-of-way, despite allowing nine months to pass before acting, Lindon honestly believed that it was immediately necessary to protect his legal rights without having to resort to civil litigation. For the purposes of §5(2): ...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{scientists}} who have researched dolphin behaviour {{have proposed that}} dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins {{should be seen as}} non-human persons who should have their own <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> and that it is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch. Four countries – Chile, Costa Rica, Hungary, and India – have declared dolphins to be [...] "non-human persons" [...] and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.|$|E
2500|$|Russell had {{admitted}} to that during his appeal, {{but he and}} his lawyers argued that the entrapment defense should focus entirely on what the federal operatives did and not his state of mind. They asked the Court to overrule two previous cases that had established this [...] "subjective" [...] test in favor of the [...] "objective" [...] one they advocated. It declined to do so. But Justice William Rehnquist pondered the possibility that what has become known as [...] "outrageous government conduct" [...] might force a judicial hand in an entrapment case regardless of any <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> that had been or not been violated. While he backed away from it in a later opinion, his words have become a rallying point for advocates of the objective entrapment standard.|$|E

As an appointee to the committee on Civil and Political Functions, she urged the assemblage to petition their state legislatures for the right of suffrage, the right of married women to hold property, and as many other <b>specific</b> <b>rights</b> as they felt practical to seek in their respective states. Then she gave a brief speech, saying, [...] "We want to be something more than the appendages of Society; we want that Woman should be the coequal and help-meet of Man in all the interest and perils and enjoyments of human life. We want that she should attain {{to the development of}} her nature and womanhood; we want that when she dies, it may not be written on her gravestone that she was the [...] "" [...] of somebody." ...|$|E
