40|$|We {{studied the}} {{ignition}} {{process of the}} plasma which is created when a pulsed CO 2 laser beam irradiates a (Ti) metal sample in presence of an ambient gas. It is {{pointed out that the}} first step is due to target <b>surface</b> <b>micro-defect</b> vaporization. Then thermal ionization of the metal vapour occurs producing electrons which are heated by the inverse bremsstrahlung process. Finally, we observe an erosion plasma (which is dominated by the metal vapour) or a gas breakdown plasma, depending on the laser intensity and on the ambient gas properties. This can be described by the energy balance of plasma electrons and by the evaluation of material thermal heating...|$|E
40|$|High {{frequency}} {{fatigue testing}} always provokes {{questions about whether}} the testing conditions are representative for the real application conditions. Therefore, any influences coming from the testing procedure must be known and understood before relying on the fatigue data based on high frequency testing for component design and validation phases. For this reason and because metastable austenitic steels are well known for their strain rate sensitivity (Müller-Bollenhagen, 2011; Sorich, 2016), the steel AISI 304 and the role of <b>surface</b> <b>micro-defects</b> produced by laser beam cutting were analyzed regarding the influence of load frequency on the cyclic response and fatigue behavior, and the findings of the investigation are thoroughly discussed in this paper. Fatigue tests were performed at load frequencies of 100 Hz and 1000 Hz using two resonance pulsation test systems, as well as by means of a servo-hydraulic test machine at 1 Hz and 50 Hz. All fatigue experiments were performed at tensile-tensile loading condition (R = 0. 1). The cyclic deformation behavior was characterized based on the evaluation of stress-strain hysteresis loops and temperature measurements. The deformation-induced phase transformation from γ-austenite to α′-martensite was globally and locally evaluated by means of magneto-inductive measurements and EBSD analysis, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time it was possible to compare test results generated by a 1000 Hz resonance pulsation test system with results from a conventional resonance test stand cycling at around 100 Hz. The analyses showed that higher amounts of α′-martensite and lower plastic strain amplitudes are observed when the cyclic experiments are carried out at lower frequency, promoting higher fatigue strengths. Nevertheless, the influence of test frequency for specimens containing <b>surface</b> <b>micro-defects</b> is dominant in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) regime while in the high cycle fatigue (HCF) and very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) range the fatigue life determining parameter is the severity of the micro-notches present along the laser cut surface...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{components}} {{with superior}} surface characteristics is challenging when {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) is employed for mass production. The aim {{of this research is}} to enhance the characteristics of AISI D 2 steel surface machined with EDM through adding Ti nano-powder to dielectric under various machining parameters, including discharge duration (T-on) and peak current (I). Surface roughness profilometer, FESEM and AFM analysis were utilized to reveal the machined surface characteristics in terms of surface roughness, surface morphology and <b>surface</b> <b>micro-defects.</b> Moreover, EDX analysis was performed in order to evaluate the atomic deposition of Ti nano-powder on the surface. The concentration of Ti nano-powder in dielectric was also examined using ESEM and EDX. According to the results, the addition of Ti nano-powder to dielectric notably enhanced the surface morphology and surface roughness at all machining parameters except T-on = 340 mu s. Of these parameters, maximum enhancement was observed at T-on = 210 mu s, where the material removal rate and average surface roughness improved by similar to 69 and similar to 35 % for peak current of 6 and 12 A, respectively. Elemental analysis signified negligible Ti deposition on the machined surface while the atomic concentration of Ti was increased around the crack areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractMicro {{machining}} of nonconductive {{materials such}} as glass is critical as it has numerous applications in microsystems including biomedical devices, micro-reactors, micro-pumps, micro-accelerometers and MEMS. Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) is a promising process for the micromachining of glass. However, ECDM often inadvertently causes surface wrinkling and surface damages. This paper studies the effect of concentration of electrolyte in ECDM on the integrity of a micro machined hole surface. The study includes: analysis of <b>surface</b> roughness and <b>micro-defects,</b> microstructure by EDAX testing and hardness testing by nano indentation. It was found that lower electrolyte concentrations in ECDM enhance chemical etching that causes surface wrinkling...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs {{have been}} {{submitted}} to DC life-tests in impact ionisation regime with and without thermal stress. Control devices present an identical and steep shape of the on-state breakdown locus while aged devices present a large dispersion of this characteristic. It seems that some slight modification of the <b>surface</b> properties and/or <b>micro-defects</b> located in the gate-drain region affect the on-state breakdown voltage loci measured with a gate current of 0. 13 mA/mm. After the two life-tests, the temperature evolution of the surface leakage contribution to the reverse gate current has increased while impact ionisation current remains unchanged. This result is confirmed by a weak temperature dependence of the on-state breakdown voltage measured with a gate current of 1 mA/mm. These slight modifications of the surface properties do not affect the reliability of this technology...|$|R
