Twenty F. miliacea seeds were <b>surface</b> <b>sown</b> in ten plastic buckets of 18 cm diameter filled with 3 kg soil. After germina-tion only one plant/bucket was retained. Time of first seedling emergence, time and number of leaves appearing until first tiller formation, time of tiller formation, first inflorescence, the first 10 inflorescences appearance and their maturity were recorded for each plant. Plant height {{and the number of}} inflorescence per plant was recorded weekly for up to 4 months after sowing. The first ten inflorescences for each plant were tagged after emergence, subsequently mature inflo-rescences were collected and the numbers of spikelets/inflorescence, seeds/inflorescence, seeds/ plant and 1000 seed weight were determined. Statistical analysis was performed as complete randomized design on weekly observed plant height and inflorescence number using the SAS statistical software and means were tested using Tukey’s studentized range test at the 5 % level of probability. Fimbristylis miliacea seedlings emerged at 3 days after planting of seeds. Approximate times required for the sequential production of 10 leaves, tillers, first 10 inflorescence and their maturity were 28 days after emergence (DAE), 35 DAE, 49 DAE, 63 DAE, respectively. Plant height increased rapidly from 3 - 8 WAE and maximum plant height (64. 05 cm) was attained at 10 WAE. This species had three important growth stages: a slow growth stage during the first 4 weeks after emergence (WAE); a rapid growth stage from 4 - 9 WAE; and finally, a maximum growth stage from 9 - 17 WAE. Within this first 4 weeks after emergence would be the most appropriate time for controlling this species with early post-emergence herbicides. Each F. miliacea plant produced on average of 2. 3 tillers/plant and a total of 134 inflorescences, with 84 inflorescences/plant ripening within this period. Each inflorescence comprised 48 spikelets with 511 seeds and matured after 3 weeks of emergence. Total seeds/plant and 1000 seed weight were 42275 and 0. 035 g, respectively.

40|$|Weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides (Labill.) R. Br. var stipoides) is an Australian native {{grass of}} {{widespread}} occurrence throughout Australia. It is a perennial, cool-season grass which produces slender rhizomes and remains green {{throughout the year}} producing high quality forage (Willis, 1970; Mitchell, 1994). It occurs naturally {{in a number of}} habitats from damp grasslands to heath, woodland and forest as well as shady parts of lawns and gardens. It is considered as having potential in the fields of amenity turf, grazing and revegetation since it produces green foliage all year, is tolerant of close grazing or mowing, acid soils, drought and shading, amongst other factors. Commercial production of weeping grass is desirable in order to make this grass available to the broader market. However a number of factors need to be considered before full commercialisation of this grass. Harlan (1960) indicated that seed production, seedling vigour and establishment were the critical factors in the successful domestication of a native grass. Aspects of these factors were considered in this thesis. Two experiments were undertaken to address the gaps in knowledge that prevent commercialisation of weeping grass. Experiment 1 considered the establishment of weeping grass and examined the use of pre-emergent herbicides on the seedling stage to determine if selective herbicides exist for this species. This experiment went on to consider the particular requirements for the best germination of seedlings in terms of the depth of sowing, {{the presence or absence of}} a mulch and the cleaning of the seed of its lemma and palea. Of the herbicides tested, Trifluralin was shown to be useful for this purpose in both spring and autumn and Pendimethalin was useful for spring applications. The other herbicides tested, Ethofumesate, Dithiopyr and Bensulide were not selective with weeping grass and cannot be recommended for use. For both seed treatments i. e. intact and cleaned, the two most shallow treatments provided the best germination results for the earliest days of assessment. For <b>surface</b> <b>sown</b> seeds the fastest germination was from seed that had been cleaned of its protective lemmas and which had been covered with a mulch. Experiment 2 considered several factors which may have an impact on the seed production of weeping grass. The factors considered were the effect of the accessions, nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation on seed production. It was found that there were significant variations between the accessions of weeping grass in regard to a number of factors related to reproductive growth. The accessions also showed variation in vegetative characters, and these results together highlight the potential for making suitable selections for desired characters from within the weeping grass gene pool. It was shown that weeping grass was strongly responsive to applications of nitrogen fertilizers, with late applications of nitrogen fertilizer promoting late season seed production. In regard to the irrigation treatments that were applied over the summer/autumn period, some accessions were more sensitive than others to the irrigation regime and the production of culms was more dependent upon the season than on soil moisture. However frequent irrigation did increase the number of culms. The irrigation effect on the increase in culm numbers and seed produced was more influenced by the frequency of irrigation than by the absolute amount of irrigation applied, with infrequent irrigation reducing the number of new culms and seeds compared to more frequent irrigation.

40|$|The key {{to pasture}} {{improvement}} in the tussock country of the South Island is in the introduction of high-producing legumes. White, red and alsike clovers {{have been widely used}} with considerable success. Lucerne, as yet, is much less important, even though it has been shown by Iversen (1965) that on droughty soils it can produce much more dry matter than conventional pastures. One of the main reasons for the lesser use of lucerne is the difficulty in establishing the plant by <b>surface</b> <b>sowing</b> methods, particularly in acid soils. Lucerne is particularly sensitive to acid soil conditions which affect establishment and growth in several ways. There are two possible approaches to overcoming problems of establishing lucerne on acid soils. The usual method is to modify the soil environment to suit the plant, by heavy broadcast liming. This is often uneconomic in tussock country owing to high transport costs. Another approach is to select strains of R. meliloti and species of lucerne which are more tolerant of acid soils. The latter approach has distinct possibilities, but, at present, it is a relatively new field. At Lincoln College an attempt is being made to combine both approaches in overcoming establishment problems in the tussock country...|$|R

This research aimed to investigate the effect of two types of roofs (clay and fiber-cement tiles) in a tropical area on the thermal comfort of farrowing sows and piglets. Twelve sows and forty-eight piglets were observed during summer in the Southeast region of Brazil. Climate variables, thermal comfort and <b>surface</b> temperature (<b>sows</b> and piglets) were assessed. The type of roofs clearly affected the piglets' surface temperature during all studied periods, but the results were not similar in the sows' surface temperature.

40|$|Proximity {{factors such}} as row spacing change the spatial {{distribution}} of crop plants and alters the intensity of crop-weed competition (Fischer and Miles 1973). Narrow row spacing is likely to facilitate crop plants with greater competitive ability than weeds, compared to wide row spacing (Hashem et al. 1998). In dry land conservation agriculture (CA), wide rows may ensure some temporal and spatial water availability at critical crop growth stages to ensure profitable yields. However, good weed management becomes {{critical to the success}} of wide row systems, as failure to control water-using weeds defeats the purpose of wide row cropping where water conservation is the focus.

When finished medicinal product itself has not a sufficient antimicrobial activity, in its composition can be administered antimicrobial preservatives, which is especially important for medicines as aqueous solutions. Because microbial contamination can cause infection of the patient or damage to the finished product, antimicrobial preservatives are designed to prevent microbial contamination of the finished medicinal product during storage and use, especially in the case of multi-container packaging. Rationale of composition and technology of spray “Efial” was conducted by us using physical, chemical and technological methods. An important task in creating new medicines is the study of preservatives choice. The aim of this work is to test the effectiveness of antimicrobial preservatives of spray “Efial”.

40|$|Due to {{reductions}} in winter food resources, newly sown cereal seeds {{have become a}} key component of many bird species' diets, but these seeds are often treated with pesticides that may cause toxic effects. To complete an appropriate risk assessment, data on treated seed toxicity need to be combined with information about the risk of exposure of birds in the field and the factors that modulate such exposure. We studied the abundance of pesticide-treated seeds available for birds in the field, the pesticides and their concentrations in treated seeds, and the bird species observed in the field that were feeding on these pesticide-treated seeds. The exposure of red-legged partridge to treated winter cereal seeds was characterized through the analysis of crop and gizzard contents of hunted individuals (n =  189). Moreover, we measured the contribution of cereal seeds in the autumn–winter diet of partridges in order to assess the potential risk of exposure to pesticide-treated seeds. Density of treated seeds on the soil <b>surface</b> after <b>sowing</b> (11 · 3  ±  1 · 2  seeds m in the centre of field and 43 · 4  ±  5 · 5  seeds m in the headlands) was enough to provide, in an area between 6 and 50  m, doses of six active ingredients above those indicating acute (i. e. a dose capable of killing 50 % of individuals of a sensitive species) and / or chronic (no observed effect level) toxicity. Up to 30 bird species were observed consuming treated cereal seeds in recently sown fields. Corn bunting was identified as an appropriate focal passerine species for the risk assessment of pesticide-treated seeds. We found that treated seeds were an important route of pesticide ingestion for red-legged partridge; pesticide residues (six fungicides and two insecticides) were found in 32 · 3 % of crops and gizzards. Cereal seeds represented more than half (53 · 4  ±  4 · 3 %) of total biomass consumed by partridges from October to February. Synthesis and applications. The field exposure data combined with previous studies about the toxicity to partridges of using pesticide-treated seeds point to an unacceptable risk of this practice to farmland birds. Our results suggest that the prophylactic use of pesticide-coated seeds should be avoided, with the approval of this treatment considered on a case-by-case basis and accompanied with specific measures to minimize risks of adverse effects on avian communities.

The average ammonia emission per sow was 0. 72, 0. 62 and 0. 70 g hour− 1 for the systems A, B and C, respectively. For the systems A, B and C this implied that 23, 20 and 23 % of the nitrogen intake was emitted as ammonia nitrogen, respectively. The emission from System B was significantly less (P< 0. 05). The diurnal pattern of the ammonia emissions from Systems A and B were biphasic and were related to feeding times. In System C the diurnal pattern had a more monophasic course related to the feeding time in the afternoon with an additional small peak in the morning after the lights were switched on. The diurnal pattern of ammonia emission from sow houses was related to the feeding schedule. Under thermoneutral conditions, giving sows a larger area at their disposal — such as with group housing — did not imply an increase in ammonia emission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh {{rates and}} {{successive}} applications of pig slurry can cause nutrient transfer by surface runoff. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the importance of surface runoff in transferring nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) under a no tillage system and for successive applications of pig slurry. The research was carried out in the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Federal University of Santa Maria, Brazil, from 2002 to 2007 in a Typic Hapludalf soil. Pig slurry rates of 0, 20, 40 and 80 m 3 ha− 1 were applied, scattered on the <b>surface,</b> before the <b>sowing</b> of each species in a cultivation sequence. On average 119, 238 and 475 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of N; 102, 203 and 406 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of P and 43, 87 and 173 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of K were added, for rates of 20, 40 and 80 m 3 ha− 1 of pig slurry, respectively. Samples of water runoff from the soil surface were collected during the entire period and the minerals, N, P and K were determined. Successive applications of pig slurry decreased surface runoff. In relative terms, the K losses were higher than N and P. As regards total nutrients applied through pig slurry, losses through surface runoff were of 2. 74, 1. 61 and 1. 37 % of mineral N; 6. 29, 5. 01 and 3. 51 % of available P and 17. 16, 9. 01 and 11. 14 % of available K, for the three rates of applied pig slurry, respectively. Repeated applications of pig slurry on a no tillage managed soil caused losses of N, P and K from the soil through surface runoff, in the sequence: K>P>N. The losses of N and K are positively related to the volume of surface runoff, whereas the losses of P are positively related to the quantities of P added through pig slurry. Applications of pig slurry along the years decrease the surface runoff...|$|R
40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is a {{promising}} post-wet-season crop to follow rainfed rice (Oryza sativa) in the High Barind Tract of northwestern Bangladesh. Yields in farmers' fields, however, remain low (< 1 t ha- 1) {{primarily due to}} factors such as poor crop establishment, late sowing, and terminal drought and heat stress. Having been shown to improve plant stand and yield of chickpea in other environments, seed priming - soaking the seed overnight before <b>surface</b> drying and <b>sowing</b> the next day - of chickpea cv. Barichola- 2 was tested for its efficacy under Barind conditions. In the 1998 - 99 season, 30 trials, grown entirely on residual soil moisture were conducted in farmers' fields in districts of Rajshahi and Nawabganj. A statistically significant mean yield response to priming of 47 % was obtained. In 1999 - 2000, 105 on-farm trials (in Rajshahi, Nawabganj, Noagaon and Niamatpur) and 15 demonstrations (in Godagari) comparing presence and absence of priming were conducted. The crop received rain during this growing season. In a randomly chosen subset of 35 trials, scientists recorded a mean yield increase due to priming of 20 %; it was 22 % (from 1. 02 to 1. 25 t ha- 1) in the remaining 64 trials (6 of the 105 trials were abandoned) where farmers recorded yields. Using a different cultivar (Barichola- 5), the mean yield response to priming in 15 demonstrations was 17 % (from 1. 25 to 1. 46 t ha- 1). The priming response was attributed mainly to rapid seedling establishment, with higher plant stand and earlier crop maturity allowing escape from end-of-season stresses. Priming also reduced the incidence of stem and root diseases, and increased nodulation by native rhizobia. This simple technology can substantially increase chickpea yields to remunerative levels for the resource-poor farmers in this difficult environment. Furthermore, {{it is suggested that}} this technology can act as a catalyst for the introduction of further technologies that will permit reliable and profitable cultivation of post-rainy-season crops and thus improve the livelihoods of the rural populatio...|$|R

Three housing systems were compared: System A, with 64 sows kept individually in feeding stalls with 2. 8 m 2 surface area per sow; System B, with 62 group-housed sows, free access stalls with 3. 3 m 2 surface area per sow; System C, with 65 group-housed sows, electronic sow feeders and with 3. 4 m 2 <b>surface</b> area per <b>sow.</b> The sows in Systems A and B were fed simultaneously twice a day at 7 : 30 and 15 : 30 h.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of different temperatures (25 and 30 ± 2 ºC), light levels (62, 42, 22 and 5 % of natural light), and pH (4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0 and 6. 7) on the spore germination of Gleichenella pectinata. To accomplish this, the spores were <b>surface</b> sterilized and <b>sown</b> in bottles containing mineral medium. The spores of G. pectinata are monolets and the perispore surface can show large and irregular deposits. During germination, filamentous gametophytes with and without developing rhizoids were observed. Only gametophytes which presented developed rhizoids were able to reach the heart-shaped developmental stage. Based on the collection, the rate of and gametophyte development were generally very low. The relative germination rates were higher at 25 ºC than at 30 °C. Moreover, the highest percentages of gametophytes with developed rhizoids were observed at 22 and 5 % of natural light (8. 8 ± 2. 3 % and 11. 3 ± 2. 2 % respectively) and {{the highest percentage of}} heart-shaped gametophytes were observed at pH 4. 5 and 5. 0 (1. 2 ± 0. 8 % and 2. 2 ± 0. 8 %, respectively). A finalidade deste estudo foi analisar o potencial germinativo dos esporos de G. pectinata e verificar os efeitos de níveis de luz (62, 42, 22 e 5 % da luz natural), das temperaturas de 25 e 30 ºC e de pHs entre 4, 0 e 6, 7 na germinação. Esporos de G. pectinata são monoletes e a superfície apresenta depósitos grandes e irregulares. Observamos três classes de desenvolvimento: esporos contendo cloroplastos, gametófitos filamentosos sem rizóides desenvolvidos e gametófitos filamentosos com rizóides desenvolvidos. Somente os gametófitos com rizóides desenvolvidos foram capazes de alcançar a fase cordiforme. As porcentagens de germinação foram mais elevadas à temperatura de 25 ºC do que 30 ºC.

40|$|Tillage {{has been}} known to cause soil erosion and cost time and {{resources}} and this affects productivity and inflates the cost of production. Therefore, {{over the past few years}} in many countries, there has been a growing trend toward conservation agriculture (CA) to enhance sustainability without compromising land productivity. Three important pillars of CA are minimal tillage operations, permanent residue cover, and rotation of primary crops. Adoption of CA, however, influences weed populations differently from conventional agriculture. Weed control in CA is a greater challenge than in conventional agriculture because there is no weed seed burial by tillage operations and soil-applied herbicides are not incorporated, resulting in reduced efficacy. The behavior of weeds and their interaction with crops under CA tend to be complex and not fully understood. A large proportion of weed seed bank remains generally on or close to the soil <b>surface</b> after crop <b>sowing</b> under CA. Weed species, in which germination is stimulated by light, are likely to be more problematic in CA. In addition, in the absence of tillage, perennial weeds may also become more challenging in this system. On the other hand, weed seeds present on the soil surface are more prone to desiccation and greater predation activity of insects, especially ants. Crop residues, when uniformly and densely present, under CA could suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an initial advantage in terms of early vigor over weeds. Where pre-emergence herbicides are applied, crop residues may also intercept a considerable proportion of the applied herbicide and may result in lower herbicide efficacy. Approaches such as stale seedbed practice, uniform and dense crop establishment, use of cover crops and crop residues as mulch, crop rotations, and practices for enhanced crop competiveness with a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides could be integrated to develop sustainable and effective weed management strategies under CA systems...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of straw bedding, concrete floors, slats, and slurry in the pits to ammonia emission in a straw-bedded group-housing system for sows, the ammonia volatilisation response of urination on the potential emitting <b>surfaces</b> from a <b>sow</b> house was studied under laboratory conditions. Ammonia is mainly produced by hydrolysis of the urea in the urine: a process {{that depends on the}} characteristics of the surface of the emitting area. For the study, substrate samples were obtained from the surfaces of a concrete floor in the walking alley (A), slurry pits under the drinking area and the waiting area (D and W) and from the straw bedding (S 1, S 2, S 3). The latter represented straw with respectively a small (S 1), an average (S 2) and a high (S 3) content of slurry dropped by the sows. The controls were a sample of slurry from a reference conventional housing system with sows kept individually on partly slatted floors (R), and a sample of unsoiled fresh straw from the farm depot (S 0). After sprinkling 150 ml of urine on each sample, the ammonia volatilisation (E in mg), maximum volatilisation rate (rmax in mg/h) and time of occurrence of the maximum volatilisation rate (tmax in h) were measured during 7 days. Paired comparisons of the predicted means were based on standard error of differences (SEDs, probability P 0 · 05) and most from the slurry from the reference system (1686 mg, P 0 · 05). The highest volatilisation rate occurred from the concrete floor in the walking alley (17 · 5 mg/h, P> 0 · 05). The volatilisation rate peaked soonest with heavily soiled straw, slurry in the pit under the waiting and drinking area, concrete floor and slurry from the reference system, and latest from unsoiled straw (P> 0 · 05). The results reveal that in a sow house with straw bedding, the largest source of ammonia emission is a urine puddle on the concrete floor in the walking alley, and the smallest is a urination on straw, irrespective of the slurry content of the straw. Only at high slurry contents in the straw bedding does the rate at which ammonia is produced from urea increase. The implication is that straw bedding in a group-housing system for sows decreases the ammonia emission per m 2 after a urination; however, its effect on other gaseous emissions remains to be clarifie...|$|R
40|$|No - till {{systems have}} been widely adopted by farmers in Australia {{over the past decade}} to reduce soil erosion, improve soil {{physical}} and chemical properties, conserve soil moisture and save on fuel costs. These changes in tillage practices can have a major influence on the ecology and management of weeds. Studies were undertaken on the seed biology of six important Australian weed species to provide underpinning knowledge of their response to tillage. Field studies were also undertaken to investigate the effect of no - till on weed seedling emergence, seed bank persistence and herbicide behaviour. Seed germination of threehorn bedstraw and wild turnip, the latter only at sub - optimal temperatures, was inhibited by light. In contrast, seed germination of common sowthistle and Indian hedge mustard was stimulated by light. Seed germination of small - flowered mallow was not influenced by the light conditions. Seedling emergence of threehorn bedstraw, wild turnip, small - flowered mallow and annual ryegrass was low on the soil surface but increased with shallow burial, which suggests that farming practices that achieve shallow burial of seeds are likely to promote greater seedling emergence of these weed species. In contrast, seedling emergence of common sowthistle and Indian hedge mustard was greatest for the seeds present on the soil surface and emergence decreased with increased burial depth. In field experiments, low soil disturbance tillage systems left more seeds on the soil <b>surface</b> after crop <b>sowing,</b> whereas high soil disturbance systems buried most of the seeds. Seedling emergence of annual ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw and wild radish was greater under minimum tillage than no - till system. In contrast, seedling emergence of Indian hedge mustard, common sowthistle, silvergrass, small - flowered mallow and turnipweed was greater under the no - till system. Seedling emergence of wild oat and wild turnip was not influenced by the tillage system. Even though seedling emergence of annual ryegrass was much lower under no - till, the persistence of residual viable seeds of annual ryegrass from one season to the next was similar between the tillage systems. This was because of much greater seed decay under no - till (48 to 60 %) than that recorded under minimum tillage (12 to 39 %). All dinitroaniline herbicides (trifluralin, pendimethalin and oryzalin) were more effective in reducing the number of plants, spikes, dry matter and seed production of annual ryegrass when incorporated at sowing with tines than with the discs. At Minlaton in 2004 and 2005, bioavailable trifluralin was greater under tillage systems with greater levels of soil disturbance than under lower soil disturbance systems. In the absence of the herbicide, annual ryegrass was less competitive with wheat under the disc - sown systems. The response of grain yield to herbicides was greater under the tine - sown systems than the disc - sown systems. The performance of S - metolachlor on annual ryegrass control was investigated under no - till. The control of annual ryegrass was greater than 80 % when S - metolachlor was applied at sowing (incorporated by sowing or post - sowing pre - emergence). However, application of the herbicide at sowing resulted in phytotoxic effects on crop emergence and grain yield of wheat. Application of S - metolachlor at 20 or 23 days before sowing not only provided effective control (74 to 83 %) of annual ryegrass, it was also safe on wheat. Application of this herbicide at 40 or 46 days before sowing was relatively ineffective in controlling annual ryegrass (33 to 49 % weed kill) but safe on wheat. In conclusion, soil disturbance caused by tillage was found to have a major influence on the behaviour of the seed bank of different species including seedling emergence and decay rates of weed seeds. However, the response to tillage tended to be species - specific and was related to their seed biology. Tillage systems also had a major influence on the efficacy and bioavailability of trifluralin, which is prone to volatilisation losses. The findings of this research program are expected to contribute to the improvement in weed management under no - till systems. Thesis (Ph. D.)
