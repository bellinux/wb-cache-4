40|$|The {{article is}} devoted {{determination}} and research of perspective directions of creation of effective equipment for stamping with orbital forging. The analysis of existent equipment is conducted and conclusions {{are done in}} relation to expansion of technological possibilities. Considered and analysed two basic directions of creation of equipment. First is an equipment traditional hydraulic the press by prefix of orbital motions of active instrument. At that rate we have equipment of minimum cost and with minimum charges. The basic lack of such chart is a harmful effect of the eccentric loading on the bed of traditional the press, which is not adjusted to such external environments. The construction of block is as an example considered for stamping with an orbital forging with the individual drive of mechanism of orbital. Second is development <b>specialized</b> the <b>press</b> for stamping with an orbital forging.
