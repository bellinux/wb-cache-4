The total loss of prestress was determined as {{the sum of}} the short-term losses (elastic shortening of 20  MPa, friction loss of 54  MPa, anchorage set loss of 76  MPa) and long-term losses (shrinkage/creep, <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation)</b> of 249  MPa, resulting in a total loss of 399  MPa. The approximate method given by AASHTO LRFD, article 5.9. 5.3, was used herein to find the long-term losses, with an assumed relative humidity of 70 %. The resulting effective prestress was 1, 144  MPa. A total prestress loss of 399  MPa was obtained, resulting in the net long-term prestress force of 4, 328  kN per tendon.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{relaxation}} {{measurements were}} carried out on a plain carbon and four Ti steels over the temperature range 850 to 1050 $ sp circ$C. The {{results show that the}} stress relaxation of plain carbon austenite after a 5 % prestrain can be described by the relation $ sigma$ = $ sigma sb 0 $-$ alpha$ln(1 + $ beta$t). By contrast, in the solution-treated Ti <b>steels,</b> <b>relaxation</b> is arrested at the start of precipitation and is resumed when precipitation is complete. As a result, this new mechanical method is suitable for following carbonitride precipitation in microalloyed austenite at hot working temperatures. PTT diagrams were determined by the present technique for the steels containing 0. 05, 0. 11, 0. 18 and 0. 25 % Ti. The PTT curves obtained are C shaped for all the steels. The upper parts of these curves are shifted to significantly longer times as the Ti and C concentrations are reduced. By contrast, the positions of the lower arms of the curves are relatively independent of the current values of the solubility product (Ti) (C). This phenomenon is attributed to the catalytic effect of trace amounts of dissolved N on the nucleation rate of Ti(CN) in austenite. Changes in the size distribution and morphology of the precipitates during relaxation of the 0. 25 % Ti steel were followed by means of electron microscopy. The cube shaped Ti(CN) precipitates were heterogeneously distributed in either a chain-like or a cell-like manner. Electron microanalysis was additionally carried out to determine the compositions of the Ti carbosulphide-Mn sulphide inclusions. Finally, the experimental results are compared with the predictions of classical nucleation theory and of the diffusion controlled particle growth theory. Good agreement was obtained between the predictions of the theories and the experimental results. It is demonstrated by means of the thermodynamic analysis of nucleation that the Ti(CN) precipitate/austenite interface is of a semi-coherent nature. It is shown that the interface between a critical nucleus and the matrix can be characterized by the newly introduced coherency loss parameter C...|$|R

The {{effect of}} {{tempering}} process on the microstructure of ultra low carbon bainitic (ULCB) <b>steel</b> produced by <b>relaxation</b> precipitation controlled phase transformation (RPC) {{has been investigated}} by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The {{results showed that the}} final microstructure mainly contained lath-like bainitic ferrite, granular bainite and martensite-austenite (MA) constituent in ULCB steels. On tempering at 650 °C a slight increase was detected in the effective grain size as the strain-induced precipitates pinned up the dislocation walls and subgrains. After tempering at 700 °C, bainitic ferrite laths started to coarsen and polygonal ferrite occurred. The effective grain size of ULCB steels in as-rolled condition was 1. 5 µm at the tolerance of 10 o ~ 15 o measured by EBSD technique...|$|R
40|$|A {{cable-stayed}} bridge can be analysed by {{finite element method}} with the bridge deck and pylons modelled as beam elements taking into account geometric nonlinearities, and the stay cables as truss elements with equivalent Ernst moduli to account for cable sag. The long-term dynamic properties of concrete {{cable-stayed bridge}}s are governed by the time-dependent material behaviour, including ageing, creep and shrinkage of concrete, and <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation.</b> A design code {{can be regarded as}} a summary of experience and local material properties of a certain country or geographical location. Results of analyses using five design codes show that, although different codes give different long-term material properties, the trend of long-term dynamic characteristics is largely independent of the code adopted. An empirical formula with undetermined coefficients is hence proposed to model the long-term development of structural frequencies, which will be useful to engineers conducting structural health monitoring of concrete cable-stayed bridges irrespective of the geographical locations. Moreover, an experiment has been conducted to monitor the long-term development of dynamic properties of post-tensioned concrete beams for verification. The combined effects of time-dependent behaviour and structural damage on the structural frequencies are also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies of}} {{excessive}} multidecade deflections of prestressed segmentally erected box girders revealed that more accurate pre-dictions of the prestress loss due to <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation</b> {{are needed for}} the design of large-span creep-sensitive structures. In particular, the loss needs to be calculated as part of creep structural analysis, during which the strain of concrete to which the prestressing steel is bonded varies in each time step. The existing empirical formulas used in the EuropeanModel Code andAmerican practice, which are valid only for constant strain and constant temperature, are here generalized to arbitrarily variable strain and temperature, heeding obvious asymptotic restrictions and the fact that steel is a viscoplastic material whose constitutive principles are well known. The resulting formula is a memoryless nonlinear equation for the viscoplastic strain rate of steel {{as a function of the}} current stress, strain, and temperature. Close fits of all themain test data from the literature, including the available data on the effects of strain and temperature changes, are achieved. The effect of temperature is found to be quite im-portant and is formulated on the basis of the activation energy of viscoplastic flow of metals. Finally, the need for further tests at variable strai...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, a {{numerical}} technique is introduced {{and a computer}} program is developed for the time-dependent analysis of segmentally erected curved prestressed box-girder bridges and other structures. The program is capable of predicting the response of such structures throughout their various stages of construction and service load history. The analysis accounts {{for the effects of}} concrete creep and shrinkage, prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation,</b> differences in age between concrete segments, sequence of construction and changes in geometry and support conditions. Deviations in the positions of new segments due to the deformation of completed part of the structure needed to calculate formwork adjustment are accounted for in the analysis. The procedure is based on the displacement method of analysis where multi-node variable cross-section beam elements curved in space, as well as conventional prismatic straight elements, are used to model bridges of arbitrary geometry. Prestressed tendons can have any profile in the space and can be prestressed, restressed or removed at any construction stage. Prestress losses due to friction and anchor setting are automatically evaluated by the program. A Step-by-Step approach is used to model the construction processes and to calculate the time-dependent effects at any instant during and after construction...|$|E
40|$|Relaxation {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{time-dependent}} stress losses in prestressed concrete construction. In the present study, an experimental investigation of the stress relaxation of the prestressing steel used in construction of the Confederation Bridge is undertaken. Relaxation is measured by monitoring the reduction in stress level in an elastically strained specimen and maintained at a constant extension. Two testing methods are adopted for the experimental program, namely, the release method and the lateral deflection method. A special setup is built for each of the two testing methods. Six specimens are tested using the release testing method. Of these, two specimens are tested at each of the three initial stress levels: 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of the ultimate strength of the steel. The lateral deflection testing method is conducted on two specimens at two initial stress levels of 60 % and 70 % of the ultimate strength of the steel. The experimental results of this research are compared with <b>steel</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> estimated by the PCI expression and the CEB-FIP Code equation. These comparisons show that the available expressions underestimate the magnitude of stress relaxation losses. Based on the results of this research, an alternative equation to estimate stress <b>relaxation</b> of <b>steel</b> is proposed...|$|R

In {{order to}} analyze the stress {{relaxation}} behavior under repeated loadings for 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V <b>steel,</b> a stress <b>relaxation</b> model based on creep equations has been developed.

The calculated results were compared to the observed results of uniaxial reloading stress relaxation testing, which were performed by the National Research Institute for Metals of Japan (NRIM) for 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V stainless steel bolting material at 500 °C. It was shown that the proposed model could be applied for the present data.

40|$|The {{influence}} of strain rate on the subsequent softening kinetics {{has been investigated}} for a Nb-containing <b>steel</b> using stress <b>relaxation.</b> It was found that strain induced precipitation during static recrystallisation was enhanced {{with an increase in}} strain rate, resulting in an obvious plateau in the stress relaxation curve and a marked retarded softening. At the higher strain rate, since dynamic precipitation is suppressed during deformation, more solute Nb is left for the subsequent strain induced precipitation after deformation. The stress relaxation data were supported by grain size measurements and TEM observations. A significant {{influence of}} strain rate on the recrystallised grain size was not observed for longer annealing times after deformation, indicating that strain induced precipitation lost its retarding effect due to coarsening of precipitates. Clearly, care should be taken when extrapolating softening kinetics measured after deformation at low strain rates to softening kinetics at industrial rolling conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} faced by {{engineers}} nowadays is the restriction on structural member dimensions due to architectural and spatial concerns. Such restrictions {{have resulted in}} the use of high-strength concrete in vertical members to reduce sizes, the use of central core walls and peripheral columns to increase window areas, the use of prestressed concrete floors to increase spans, etc. Serviceability problems such as cracking may, however, arise in the long term if these problems have not received proper attention during the design stage. This paper addresses several major issues associated with this type of buildings. Firstly, the differential axial shortening between the core walls and columns caused by large differences in stress levels will induce additional stresses and strains in the horizontal structural members, which are not normally accounted for in the traditional design methods. Secondly, the post-tensioning of concrete floors gives rise to additional internal forces induced in several ways such as time-dependent effects, sequential construction, and secondary “P-δ” effects of the high-strength slender columns. Thirdly, the soil-structure interaction could induce significant additional deformations and stresses in the buildings, although they are not always taken into account properly especially when carrying out simple or preliminary designs. These issues are vital and should be carefully considered in regular structural analyses and designs. With the common practice that most of the designs of prestressed concrete building structures are sublet to prestressing specialists, common structural engineers seldom have the insight into the structural performance of these buildings. Furthermore, utilities for calculating <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation,</b> which is an important factor governing the behaviour of prestressed concrete buildings, and its interactions with other time-dependent effects of concrete are hardly found in popular commercial software packages developed for building designs. All of these problems present obstacles in the correct modelling of prestressed concrete buildings. In the light of this, a practical but accurate method of modelling <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation</b> using the equivalent creep in commercial packages, that are normally good at dealing with complicated geometry, has firstly been developed in this work. The accuracy and reliability of the method are examined by comparing the results with available numerical solutions. Good agreement is observed. Secondly, a series of studies have been carried out based on a typical prestressed concrete building to examine various effects on the structural performance. It is found that the most influential effect is the time-dependent behaviour. It induces extra column moments, differential axial shortening, losses of tendon stresses, and P-delta moments. The construction sequence and soil-structure interactions are also found to affect the structural performance but they are less critical compared with the time-dependent effects. Finally, a parametric study has been carried out to evaluate the likely ranges of time-dependent effects on the structural behaviour. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Post-tensioned cast-in-place {{concrete}} {{box girder}} bridges {{are the most}} popular type for new bridge construction in California since this class of bridges shows an increased ability to resist and dissipate seismic loads for long- span structures. However, due to the long-term behavior of the construction materials. i. e. concrete and steel, tension forces induced by prestressing decrease over time as a result of creep and shrinkage of concrete and <b>steel</b> <b>relaxation,</b> which is called long-term prestress loss. This loss {{is one of the most}} important factors to consider in designing and analyzing this type of bridges. Although the inaccurate prediction of the loss is not considered to impose severe effects on the ultimate capacity of the structures, it is known to lead to critical problems at the design and service stages. Underestimating the prestress loss can cause cracking and excessive deflection during service stage and overestimating it could lead to uneconomic design. A number of bridge specifications use varied approximations currently to predict the long-term prestress losses. However, they show significant scatter in values of their estimates even under the same environmental conditions. This diversity of prediction mainly results from two sources of error. The first source of the error is related to inaccurate material characteristics: the coefficients for creep and shrinkage of concrete. The other comes from excessive simplification in the method of analysis in the specifications. Consequently, the goals of this research are to verify which specifications can provide more accurate creep and shrinkage strains and to propose a simple yet more comprehensive analysis procedure to predict the long-term prestress losses including effects from important structural- and material-level parameters. To meet these objectives, monitoring responses from bridges in service and investigating material characteristics from cylinder specimens are in progress on four bridge spans of I 5 -I 805 and I 215 -CA 91 in San Diego and Riverside, California, respectively. Also, a simple analysis method which could be easily applied in the design is improved by incorporating the effects from the five parameters: transverse shear deformation, loading events, and horizontal reinforcements as structural-level parameters, compressive strength of concrete and thermal creep from accumulation of temperature variation as material-level parameters. The results from this research are validated by comparing with the predictions in current specifications and data from the monitored spans on I 5 - I 805 and I 215 -CA 91...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} prestressed {{steel wire}} ropes {{as a way to}} strengthen a 20 -year-old RC T-beam bridge. High strength, low <b>relaxation</b> <b>steel</b> wire ropes with minor radius, high tensile strain and good corrosion resistance were used in this reinforcement. The construction process for strengthening with prestressed {{steel wire ropes}}—including wire rope measuring, extruding anchor heads making, anchorage installing, tensioning steel wire ropes and pouring mortar was described. Ultimate bearing capacity of the bridge after strengthening was discussed based on the concrete structure theory. The flexural strength of RC T-beam bridges strengthened with prestressed steel wire ropes was governed by the failure of concrete crushing. To investigate effectiveness of the strengthening method, fielding-load tests were carried out before and after strengthening. The results of concrete strain and deflection show that the flexural strength and stiffness of the strengthened beam are improved. The crack width measurement also indicates that this technique could increase the durability of the bridge. Thus, this strengthened way with prestressed steel wire rope is feasible and effective...|$|R

Numerous corrosion initiated failures have occurred in precast prestressed concrete (PSC) piles and reinforced concrete (RC) pile caps, leading to the costly repair and replacement of either the entire bridge or the affected members. With the Federal Highway Administration's goal of a 100 -year bridge service life and recent legislative action such as the Bridge Life Extension Act, new emphasis {{has been placed on}} {{the development and implementation of}} new corrosion mitigation techniques. This thesis involves the mechanical testing, and proposed future test program of high-strength stainless steel (HSSS) prestressing strand to be used in prestressed marine bridge piles. The metallurgy for two types of HSSS strand was selected from a previous study of the corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, and feasibility of 6 candidate HSSS drawn wire samples. Duplex stainless steel (DSS) grades 2205 and 2304 were selected for production of 7 -wire 1 / 2 " diameter prestressing strand. DSS wire rod was drawn, stranded, and heat-treated using the same production methods and equipment as used for standard of practice, high carbon prestressing strand. The production process was documented to analyze the problems facing this production method and suggest improvement and optimization. After production, the strands were subjected to a series of mechanical tests. Tension testing was performed to provide a stress-strain curve for the strands and related mechanical properties. Wire samples were also taken at varying points in the drawing process to give more information about the work hardening of the stainless <b>steels.</b> Stress <b>relaxation</b> testing was performed on both strand and wire samples to assess the overall losses and to provide comparisons between strand and wire test results as well as drawn wires before and after heat-treatment. An experimental program for future study was designed to assess the HSSS prestressing strand behavior in precast piles. This testing involves assessment of pile driving performance, pile flexural and shear behavior, strand transfer and development length, long-term prestressing force losses, and material durability.
