40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting the trawl doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

40|$|During sleep, neocortical {{neuronal}} networks oscillate slowly (< 1 Hz) between periods of activity (UP states) and silence (DOWN states). UP states favor {{the interaction between}} thalamic-generated spindles (7 – 14 Hz) and cortically generated gamma (30 – 80 Hz) waves. We studied how these three nested oscillations modulate fast-spiking interneuron (FSi) activity in vivo in VGAT-Venus transgenic rats. Our data describe a population of FSi that discharge “early” within UP states and another population that discharge “late. ” Early FSi tended to be silent during epochs of desynchronization, whereas late FSi were active. We hypothesize that late FSi {{may be responsible for}} generating the gamma oscillations associated with cognitive processing during wakefulness. Remarkably, FSi populations were differently modulated by <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> gamma rhythms. Early FSi were robustly coupled to <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> always discharged earlier than late FSi within <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> gamma cycles. The preferred firing phase during <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> gamma waves was strongly correlated in each cell, suggesting a cross-frequency coupling between oscillations. Our results suggest a precise spatiotemporal pattern of FSi activity during UP states, whereby information rapidly flows between early and late cells, initially promoted by <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> efficiently extended by local gamma oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim. The role {{of sleep}} in the {{enhancement}} of motor skills has been been studied extensively in adults. We aimed to determine involvement of sleep <b>and</b> characteristics of <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> slow waves in a motor skill in children. Hypothesis. We hypothesized sleep-dependence of skill enhancement and an association of interindividual differences in skill and sleep characteristics. Methods. 30 children (19 females, 10. 7 ± 0. 8 years of age; mean±SD) performed finger sequence tapping tasks in a repeated-measures design spanning 4 days including 1 polysomnography night. Initial and delayed performance were assessed over 12 hours of wake; 12 hours with sleep; and 24 hours with wake and sleep. For the 12 hours with sleep, children were {{assigned to one of}} three conditions: modulation of slow waves <b>and</b> <b>spindles</b> was attempted using acoustic perturbation, and compared to yoked and no-sound control conditions. Analyses. Mixed effect regression models evaluated the association of sleep, its macrostructure <b>and</b> <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> slow wave parameters with initial and delayed speed and accuracy. Results and Conclusions. Children enhance their accuracy only over an interval with sleep. Unlike previously reported in adults, children enhance their speed independent of sleep, a capacity that may to be lost in adulthood. Individual differences in the dominant frequency of <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> slow waves were predictive for performance: children performed better if they had less slow spindles, more fast <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> faster slow waves. On the other hand, overnight enhancement of accuracy was most pronounced in children with more slow <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> slower slow waves, i. e. the ones with an initial lower performance. Associations of <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> slow wave characteristics with initial performance may confound interpretation of their involvement in overnight enhancement. Slower frequencies of characteristic sleep events may mark slower learning and immaturity of networks involved in motor skills...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{studies suggest}} that sleep-specific brain {{activity}} patterns such as sleep <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> EEG slow wave activity (SWA) contribute to the consolidation of novel memories. The generation of both sleep <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> SWA relies on synchronized oscillations in a thalamo-cortical network that might be implicated in synaptic strengthening (<b>spindles)</b> <b>and</b> downscaling (SWA) during sleep. Methods: This study further examined the association between EEG power during NREM sleep in the spindle (sigma, 12 – 16 Hz) and slow wave frequency range (0. 1 – 3. 5 Hz) and overnight memory consolidation in 20 healthy subjects (10 men, 27. 1 ± 4. 6 year). Results: We found that both EEG sigma power and SWA were positively correlated with the pre-post sleep consolidation of declarative (word list) and procedural (mirror tracing) memories. Conclusions: These results, although only correlative in nature, {{are consistent with the}} view that processes of synaptic strengthening (sleep <b>spindles)</b> <b>and</b> synaptic downscaling (SWA) might act in concert to promote synaptic plasticity and the consolidation of both declarative and procedural memories during sleep...|$|R
40|$|SummarySpindle {{assembly}} required during mitosis {{depends on}} microtubule polymerization. We {{demonstrate that the}} evolutionarily conserved low-complexity protein, BuGZ, undergoes phase transition or coacervation to promote assembly of both <b>spindles</b> <b>and</b> their associated components. BuGZ forms temperature-dependent liquid droplets alone or on microtubules in physiological buffers. Coacervation in vitro or in <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> <b>spindle</b> matrix depends on hydrophobic residues in BuGZ. BuGZ coacervation and its binding to microtubules and tubulin are required to promote assembly of <b>spindle</b> <b>and</b> <b>spindle</b> matrix in Xenopus egg extract and in mammalian cells. Since several previously identified spindle-associated components also contain low-complexity regions, we propose that coacervating proteins may be a hallmark of proteins that comprise a spindle matrix that functions to promote assembly of spindles by concentrating its building blocks...|$|R
