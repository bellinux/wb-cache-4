25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the court did}} not {{consider}} Quanta to have foreclosed the enforcement of the <b>shrinkwrap</b> restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's tortious interference with contract.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers and {{magazines}} are also sent through postal services. Many magazines are simply {{placed in the}} mail normally (but in the U.S., they are printed with a special bar code that acts as pre-paid postage - see POSTNET), but many are now shipped in <b>shrinkwrap</b> to protect the loose contents of the magazine. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, newspapers {{and magazines}} were normally posted using wrappers with a stamp imprint.|$|E
2500|$|Among the 135 yaoi manga {{published}} in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up. Although American booksellers were increasingly stocking yaoi titles in 2008, their restrictions led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in <b>shrinkwrap.</b> Diamond Comic Distributors valued {{the sales of}} yaoi manga in the United States at approximately $US six million in 2007. [...] By December 2007, there were over 10 publishers in North America offering yaoi materials.|$|E

2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic <b>shrinkwrap</b> {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|E
2500|$|The 1990s saw a {{flood of}} reissues of his Capitol {{recordings}} on compact disc. [...] In 1974, Owens had bought back publishing rights to all of his Capitol recordings, {{as part of his}} final contract with the label. His albums had been out of print for nearly 15 years, when he released a retrospective box set in 1990. Encouraged by brisk sales, Owens struck a distribution deal with Sundazed Records of New York, which specializes in reissuing obscure recordings. The bulk of his Capitol catalog was reissued on CD in 1995, 1997 and in 2005. Sometime in the 1970s, Owens had also purchased the remaining copies of his original LP albums from Capitol's distribution warehouses across the country. Many of those records (still in the <b>shrinkwrap)</b> were stored by Owens for decades. He often gave them away as gifts and sold them at his nightclub for a premium price some 35 years later.|$|E

50|$|PC-MOS also figured {{prominently}} in the lawsuit Arizona Retail Systems, Inc. v. The Software Link, Inc., where Arizona Retail Systems claimed The Software Link violated implied warranties on PC-MOS. The case is notable because The Software Link argued that it had disclaimed the implied warranties via a license agreement on the software's <b>shrinkwrap</b> licensing. The result of the case, which Arizona Retail Systems won, helped to establish US legal precedent regarding the enforceability of <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses.|$|E
50|$|Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology {{was a case}} in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{primarily}} concerned with the enforceability of box-top licenses and end user license agreements (EULA) and their place in U.S. contract law. During the relevant period, Step-Saver Data Systems was a value-added reseller, combining hardware and software from different vendors to offer a fully functioning computer system to various end users. Step-Saver's products included software produced by Software Link, Inc (TSL), computer terminals produced by Wyse Technology, and main computers produced by IBM. The fundamental question raised {{in this case was}} whether the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses accompanying TSL's software were legally binding, given that different terms were negotiated over the phone with Step-Saver prior to receiving physical copies of the software. The case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where the court ruled that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses were legally binding. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently reversed this decision, ruling that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses were not legally binding.|$|E

50|$|UCITA {{focuses on}} {{adapting}} current commercial trade laws {{to the modern}} software era. It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a <b>shrinkwrap</b> license to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, {{would not be able}} to force a <b>shrinkwrap</b> license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.|$|E
5000|$|Apple Computer: Apple was a {{very early}} client of the firm; the firm advised Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on the {{incorporation}} {{of the company and}} also advised Apple on the creation of the first <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreement in 1976.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 GG {{recorded}} what {{is widely}} regarded to be his masterpiece, an album entitled Murder Junkies, released by New Rose Records, featuring Antiseen as his backing band. This album contained ten musical tracks and ten spoken-word pieces. Other than Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies, Allin considered this album {{to be the one}} that most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the War in My Head - I'm Your Enemy album released on Awareness Records and featuring the band <b>Shrinkwrap.</b> This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a collage of spoken-word pieces which <b>Shrinkwrap</b> put to music.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was also}} {{designed}} {{to capitalize on}} the band's appearance on an episode of the TV series Walker, Texas Ranger. A sticker on the CD's <b>shrinkwrap</b> contained a quote by Chuck Norris about the band: [...] "It's terrible, but I guess you gotta have that kind of music, too." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{enforceability}} of an EULA {{depends on}} several factors, {{one of them}} being the court in which the case is heard. Some courts that have addressed {{the validity of the}} <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as contracts of adhesion, unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the U.C.C.—see, for instance, Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.. [...] Other courts have determined that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, Microsoft v. Harmony Computers, Novell v. Network Trade Center, and Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.|$|E
50|$|Xandros Open Circulation Edition (OCE) was a freely redistributable edition for {{non-commercial}} use, with {{a limited}} set of additional software. Soon after the 4.0 version was released as a DVD <b>shrinkwrapped</b> with Linux magazines, the torrent was pulled from Xandros' servers and all references to OCE removed from the Xandros website without explanation. Previous versions of Xandros OCE were generally released about 4 months {{after the release of}} the commercial versions.|$|R
500|$|Island Records and U2 {{refused to}} make advance copies of the album {{available}} to the press until {{just a few days}} before the release date, preferring that fans listen to the record before reading reviews. The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and journalist David Browne compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding pre-release copies of films from reviewers whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press. Achtung Baby was released on 18November 1991 in the UK and 19November in the US on compact disc, tape cassette, and vinyl record, with an initial shipment of more than 1.4million copies in the US. The album was the first release by a major act to use two so-called [...] "eco-friendly" [...] packages—the cardboard Digipak, and the <b>shrinkwrapped</b> jewel case without the long cardboard attachment. Island encouraged record stores to order the jewel case packaging by offering a four-percent discount.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 June 2005 {{the staff}} of the Committee on Government Reform {{prepared}} a report for Congressman Henry Waxman on the CPA's expenditures from the DFI that raised additional causes for concern. Further criticism was leveled at the CPA when it was revealed that $12 billion of cash had been delivered by C-130 planes on <b>shrinkwrapped</b> pallets of $100 bills. The cash deliveries were described in a memo prepared for the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which concluded that [...] "Many of the funds appear to have been lost to corruption and waste.... Some of the funds could have enriched both criminals and insurgents...." [...] Henry Waxman, the chair of the House committee commented, [...] "Who {{in their right mind would}} send 363 tons of cash into a war zone?" [...] A single flight to Iraq on 12 December 2003 which contained $1.5 billion in cash is said to be the largest single Federal Reserve payout in US history according to Henry Waxman.|$|R
