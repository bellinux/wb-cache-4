Firstly, we consider a single trapped ion qubit inside a perfect cavity and successively we use it to construct a bipartite <b>system</b> made <b>of</b> two of such subsystems, taken identical and noninteracting.

Traffic Flow in Long Tunnels The properties of traffic flow in long highway tunnels has been under individual consideration since the middle of the last century (see, e. g., Refs [1, 2]). Interest to this problem is caused by several reasons. The first and, may be, main one is safety. Jams in long tunnels are rather dangerous and detecting the critical states of vehicle flow leading to the jam formation is of the prime importance for the tunnel operation.

40|$|In our {{previous}} work [17], {{we proposed a}} model-based combi-natorial testing method, called FOT. It provides a technique to design test-models for combinatorial testing based on ex-tended logic trees. In this paper, we introduce pair-wise testing (and by extension, n-wise testing, where n = 1, 2, [...] ) to FOT, by developing a technique to construct a test-suite of n-wise strategies from the test models in FOT. We take a “transformation approach ” to realize this technique. To construct test suites, this approach first transforms test-models in FOT, represented as extended logic trees, {{to those in the}} formats which the existing n-wise testing tools (such as PICT [9], ACTS [30], CIT-BACH [31], etc.) accept to input, and then applies transformed test-models to any of these tools. In this transformation approach, an algorithm, called “flattening algorithm”, plays a key role. We prove the correctness of the algorithm, and implement the algorithm to automate such test-suite constructions, providing a tool called FOT-nw (FOT with n-wise). Further, to show the ef-fectiveness of the technique, we conduct a case study, where we apply FOT-nw to design test models and automatically construct test suites of n-wise strategies for an embedded <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>stationary</b> services for real-use in industry...|$|R
50|$|This supertask, {{proposed}} by J. P. Laraudogoitia, {{is an example}} of indeterminism in Newtonian mechanics. The supertask consists of an infinite collection <b>of</b> <b>stationary</b> point masses. The point masses are all of mass m and are placed along a line AB that is a meters in length at positions B, AB / 2, AB / 4, AB / 8, and so on. The first particle at B is accelerated to a velocity of one meter per second towards A. According to the laws of Newtonian mechanics, when the first particle collides with the second, it will come to rest and the second particle will inherit its velocity of 1 m/s. This process will continue as an infinite amount of collisions, and after 1 second, all the collisions will have finished since all the particles were moving at 1 meter per second. However no particle will emerge from A, since there is no last particle in the sequence. It follows that all the particles are now at rest, contradicting conservation of energy. Now the laws of Newtonian mechanics are time-reversal-invariant; that is, if we reverse the direction of time, all the laws will remain the same. If time is reversed in this supertask, we have a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>stationary</b> point masses along A to AB / 2 that will, at random, spontaneously start colliding with each other, resulting in a particle moving away from B at a velocity of 1 m/s.
