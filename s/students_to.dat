30|$|Rather {{than simply}} lecturing <b>to</b> the <b>student,</b> the tutor {{provides}} scaffolding for the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> articulate the expectations {{through a number}} of dialog moves. A pump is a generic expression <b>to</b> get the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> provide more information, such as “What else?” or “Tell me more.” Hints and prompts are selected by the tutor <b>to</b> get the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> articulate missing content words, phrases, and propositions. A hint tries <b>to</b> get the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> express a lengthy constituent (e.g., proposition, clause, sentence), whereas a prompt is a question that tries <b>to</b> get the <b>student</b> <b>to</b> express a single word or phrase. The tutor generates an assertion if the <b>student</b> fails <b>to</b> express the expectation after multiple hints and prompts. AutoTutor provides a cycle of pump → hint → prompt → assertion for each expectation until the expectation is covered. As the student and tutor express information over many turns, the list of expectations is eventually covered and the main task is completed.|$|R
