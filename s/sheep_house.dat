By 1931, the manor estate {{consisted}} of the mansion, overseer's house, horse stable, bank barn, 3 silos, corn house, 11 tenant houses, wash house, <b>sheep</b> <b>house,</b> coach house, brick barn and two barracks.|$|E
5000|$|These are the {{two most}} {{remarkable}} buildings in the Home Farm complex and are listed Grade II* They are at the N W side of the farm and were built around 1855. The buildings consist of 2 circular sheds both of which are open in the centre; the W shed was a <b>sheep</b> <b>house,</b> the E shed was a piggery. These are joined by a long link range which housed sheep on the N side, facing the fields, and probably cattle on the S side facing the 2 stockyards. The <b>sheep</b> <b>house</b> and piggery has louvres in the vent ridges of the roof. Its inner wall has drains at the internal floor level above a deep sump in which there are 8 radiating tunnels with round-headed openings. The slurry from the animals would drain in to the circular sumps, before being piped away for use as manure to fertilise the estate fields. The timber framing used to construct the very complex structure of the ridge of the circular buildings is remarkable. The roofs drain water both outwards and inwards, into the circular sump. It has been suggested that these circular buildings were developed from similar farm building on model farms in the U.S.A. , but Wilian illustrates another circular cowhouse at Cae’r lan, Abercraf, Breconshire. This lacks the central sump, but is of the same date ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of three different}} ventilation regimens on air pollution in <b>sheep</b> <b>houses</b> and {{on the quality of}} ewe milk and of Canestrato, Pugliese cheese was investigated during the summer season. The experimental treatments were low ventilation regimen (VR= 35 m(3) /h per ewe) split in 30 -min ventilation cycles (LOV- 30); moderate ventilation regimen (VR= 70 m(3) /h per ewe) split in 30 -min ventilation cycles (MOV- 30); moderate ventilation regimen (VR= 70 m(3) /h per ewe) split in 60 -min ventilation cycles (MOV- 60). The LOV- 30 milk had higher microbial load and bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) and resulted in a weaker casein matrix in the curd compared with the MOV- 30 and MOV- 60 treatments. At 45 d of ripening, the LOV- 30 cheeses had a lower casein content and higher non-casein nitrogen (NCN) and water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) contents than the MOV- 30 and MOV- 60 cheeses. Urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) of the pH 4 (.) 6 -soluble N extract showed that the MOV- 60 cheeses had fewer bands derived from casein (CN) hydrolysis than the LOV- 30 or MOV- 30 cheeses, despite its having exhibited the highest plasmin (PL) activity levels. Our results suggest that the ventilation regimen is critical in dairy <b>sheep</b> <b>housing</b> for optimizing the hygienic quality of ewe milk and the proteolytic processes occurring in Canestrato Pugliese cheese during ripening...|$|R

Peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) samples of the 22 cattle, and nasal (n = 7) and conjunctival (n = 9) swab samples from 16 sheep from two different farms, were taken for laboratory examination. The clinical diagnosis of MCF in cows was confirmed by the detection of ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV- 2) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). OvHV- 2 DNA was detected by nested-PCR in PBL of one cow with clinical signs and nasal (1 / 7) -conjunctival(1 / 9) swab samples of two <b>sheep</b> <b>housed</b> in the same barn.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} heat stress {{conditions}} imposed onto <b>sheep</b> <b>housed</b> in a naturally ventilated sheep barn {{during the four}} seasons of a year.

The analysis shows that animals were exposed to heat stress in 11 %, 80 % and 17 % of spring, summer and autumn hours, respectively, whereas no heat stress was identified during winter. As expected, animals are more prone to severe heat stress during summer, as the daily maximum hourly values of THI remained higher than the extreme severe heat stress threshold (i. e. THI = 25. 6) in 90 % of the summer days. Additionally, THI remained higher than 25. 6 during {{the vast majority of the}} summer daytime hours.

40|$|Abstract. Spinosad, applied as a jetting {{solution}} or dip is an efficacious, non-systemic {{treatment for}} the control of Bovicola ovis in sheep. This paper describes the effect of back-line treatment width and group housing of animals on the efficacy of spinosad for the control of lice. A 0. 4 mg/kg liveweight dose {{was found to be}} the suboptimal dose of spinosad for the control of body lice in a dose titration study and was used to investigate application and housing effects in a second study. Lousy Merino sheep were treated with either a narrow 3 -cm application of spinosad or with a wider 25 -cm swathe. After treatment they were either kept alone or in groups of 6 sheep per pen. Lice were counted at day 0 and every 14 days to 70 days after treatment before estimation of the percentage of lice control and analysis of treatment effects. A much higher percentage of lice control was achieved with 0. 4 mg/kg in the second study than in the first, possibly because of differences in formulation used. The wider application width gave significantly higher (P< 0. 05) control of lice than the narrow application when <b>sheep</b> were either <b>housed</b> alone or in groups up to day 42 post-treatment. Greater control of lice was seen in group-housed sheep compared with <b>sheep</b> <b>housed</b> individually (P< 0. 05) up to day 70.

50|$|For a {{detailed}} risk assessment of scrapie-contaminated soil, {{it was of}} major importance to analyze whether the detectable PrPSc in the soil extracts still exhibited oral infectivity after incubation times up to 29 months. A bioassay with Syrian hamsters was performed by feeding the animals with contaminated soil or aqueous soil extracts that had been collected after soil incubation for 26 and 29 months, respectively. Hamsters fed with contaminated soil exhibited their first scrapie-associated symptoms at two weeks to six months (95% CI) after the first feeding. The hamsters reached the terminal stage of scrapie at five to 21 months (95% CI) after the first feeding. This indicated substantial amounts of persistent infectivity in soil that had been incubated for 26 and 29 months. In Iceland in 1978, a program was implemented to eradicate scrapie, and affected flocks were culled, premises were disinfected, and <b>sheep</b> <b>houses</b> were burnt; after two to three years, the premises were restocked with lambs from scrapie-free areas. Between 1978 and 2004, scrapie recurred on 33 farms. Nine recurrences occurred 14-21 years after culling {{as a result of}} persistent environmental contamination with PrPSc.|$|R
