Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum <b>system,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E

5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, {{rather than in the}} nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular <b>system,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J.

Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel <b>system,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune <b>system,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
