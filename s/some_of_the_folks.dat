2500|$|Following the Best Picture {{nomination}} of Beauty and the Beast at the 64th Academy Awards and its subsequent loss in March 1992, then-studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg opted to produce another animated sweeping romantic epic {{in hopes of}} replicating another Best Picture nomination. With Aladdin and The Lion King too far into development, Katzenberg believed that Pocahontas had a chance, and pushed for the title protagonist to be older, the romance between Pocahontas and Smith to be more adult, and for the animals to be mute. Head of Story Tom Sito went on the record stating he wanted to include more and broader jokes, but the [...] "higher-ups wanted it more winsome, more gentle. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> were so concerned about political correctness, they didn't want to be cuckoo-wacky about it." [...] Likewise, Eric Goldberg – following his work on Aladdin as the supervising animator for the Genie and {{with all of the}} animation units for The Lion King already occupied – was asked to co-direct Pocahontas with Gabriel, in which he agreed to and was given a pitch of the film. Goldberg had expected the film to be more comedic and cartoonish like Aladdin, but Schneider told Goldberg that the film would be produced in the vein of Beauty and the Beast, and the ongoing Los Angeles riots in 1992 further inspired him to commit to the film because of its racial overtones. The executive interference would eventually grow too much that Goldberg himself worked under the pseudonym [...] "Claude Raynes" [...] for Chuck Jones Productions during production. Executive paranoia reached a peak when Joe Grant had drawn Percy wearing an Indian feather, by which the animators took the concept one step further by placing a Spanish ruff on Meeko. One executive exclaimed, [...] "Animals don't have the intelligence to switch their clothes! They don't even have opposing thumbs." [...] The animators would retain their concept for the film.|$|E

In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folk</b> music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folk</b> music for <b>the</b> show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to <b>the</b> best collection <b>of</b> American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with <b>the</b> first prize <b>of</b> $250 awarded in 1949.|$|R

6000|$|Erik {{had been}} seen in flannels and an {{imitation}} panama hat, playing on the abandoned court with Willis Woodford, the clerk in Stowbody's bank.

25|$|All {{descendants}} of Haldan were slain {{during the civil}} war, and later Avranc, son of Dorlas, was elected the Chieftain by <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>Folk,</b> since he was from the beginning opposing Húrin, who had caused the kin-strife. Avranc had no such authority as previous Haladin, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Folk</b> refused to admit his rule and forsook Brethil.

A mere matter, for the most part, of latitude and longitude, and geographical position, acting with natural temperament. The greater part is nothing but an accident! Your father, for example, settles in Vermont, {{in a town where}} all are, in fact, free and equal; becomes a regular church member and deacon, and in due time joins an Abolition society, and thinks us all little better than heathens. Yet he is, for all the world, in constitution and habit, a duplicate of my father. I can see it leaking out in fifty different ways,--just the same strong, overbearing, dominant spirit. You know very well how impossible it is to persuade <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> in your village that Squire Sinclair does not feel above them.

Second, I want to talk about the new directions in which this development will push us; I will talk very briefly about future reform proposals in the campaign finance context, some of which we have already talked about today. Finally, I will talk about where I think campaign finance should go. Here I 2 ̆ 7 ll argue that, just as brown is the new black, lobbying is the new campaign finance.
