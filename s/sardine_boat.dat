50|$|Massy {{was born}} in Biarritz, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France. The son of a sheep farmer, he worked on a <b>sardine</b> <b>boat</b> and {{supplemented}} his income by caddying at the new Biarritz golf course where {{a great many of}} the best professional golfers from Britain came to practice during the off-season in the warm climate of southern France. Blessed with natural abilities, he learned from these pro golfers and in 1898 traveled to North Berwick, Scotland to develop his skills for a professional career.|$|E
40|$|It was {{not because}} of a boat {{shortage}} that amateur marine biologist, John Steinbeck, {{had a tough time}} finii. ng one for his scientific expedition. In 1940, the sardines still came to Monterey, and Monterey had an impresisve fleet of sardine boats that would have been perfect for Steinbeck's expedition. Steinbeck and his friend, professional biologist Ed Ricketts, needed the <b>sardine</b> <b>boat</b> {{to get down to the}} Gulf of california, otherwise known as the Sea of Cortez. They were going to collect marine invertebrates in this scarcely documented area, in a <b>sardine</b> <b>boat</b> with its large roomy hold, perfect for storing specimen jars, was what they needed. To the bemused and disbelieving fishennan, Steinbeck and Ricketts were sailing for dangerous, badly charted waters in order to collect worms and bugs. I twasclearly nonsense. The search for a boat became long and harrowing, but ended successfully when Steinbeck found the Western Flyer. Her skipper, Tony Berry, did not shock easily; he had dealt with salmon tagging scientists before in Alaska, arrl he was used to nonsense...|$|E
50|$|When France {{fell to the}} German advance, {{he refused}} the {{armistice}} and with some friends, including , went to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The tiny fishing port in the southwestern corner of the Bay of Biscay was crowded with civilians and French and Polish troops {{trying to get away}} from German forces. Here, the fishermen used their <b>sardine</b> <b>boats</b> to ferry passengers through heavy seas to any of a number of larger vessels that had gathered there. On 24 June, Letac boarded the cargo vessel Baron Nairn.|$|R
5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay <b>sardine</b> fishing <b>boat,</b> the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, but it seems to have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|R
40|$|Evolution {{of catch}} and catch by unit {{effort of the}} <b>sardine</b> fishing <b>boats</b> (purse seiners) has been {{examined}} from 1966 to 1975. The effort data has been calculated with a new computer programme: Crosardi (Soisson et Barbe, 1974). The analysis {{has been done on}} the whole stock and in more detail on the east and west stocks of Côte d'Ivoire. The Sardinella eba stock has been analysed separately. Those analyses were done using the general production model (Prodfit; Fox, 1974). The stock of the eastern area of the Côte d'Ivoire seems to be exploited at its maximum level. Nevertheless, the western area stock could be able to support a progressive increase of fishing effort. ...|$|R
