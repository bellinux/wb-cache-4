25|$|Although the Quadro Tracker was enjoined {{from being}} {{manufactured}} or {{sold in the}} United States after a 1996 federal court case, Quadro's four principal figures escaped criminal sanctions after a jury failed to convict them.

Some of the distribution agents broke away and began producing their own copies of the Quadro Tracker, such as the Alpha 6, Mole Programmable Substance Detector, Sniffex and GT200.

25|$|On October 5, 2008, Anthony Limon {{had agreed}} {{as a favor}} to Torres to drive four men in his Hummer {{limousine}} that night, picking up the first three and taking them to the Elephant Bar restaurant in suburban Lakewood, where they picked up Saenz. Later, he ordered Limon to drive to Montebello, then at 5 a.m. ordered him to drive to the limo owner's home in Whittier. Saenz was filmed on a home surveillance system arriving at Torres' house, chasing him out of his front door and then shooting Torres four times in the head, possibly due to lost money. The DVD disc that had captured the shooting was removed from the surveillance system. However, shortly after the investigation of the homicide, video of the murder was retrieved from the <b>security</b> <b>equipment's</b> hard drive, leading investigators to identify Saenz as the shooter.|$|R
