50|$|No-bake <b>molds</b> are {{expendable}} <b>sand</b> <b>molds,</b> {{similar to}} typical <b>sand</b> <b>molds,</b> except they also contain a quick-setting liquid resin and catalyst. Rather than being rammed, the <b>molding</b> <b>sand</b> is {{poured into the}} flask and held until the resin solidifies, which occurs at room temperature. This type of molding also produces a better surface finish than other types of <b>sand</b> <b>molds.</b> Because no heat is involved it is called a cold-setting process. Common flask materials that are used are wood, metal, and plastic. Common metals cast into no-bake molds are brass, iron (ferrous), and aluminum alloys.|$|R

5000|$|Foundry patternmakers have {{historically}} been woodworkers with skills of a woodcarver, woodturner, and cabinet maker. When an object is made from cast iron, cast aluminum or any liquified metal the patternmaker is employed to make a wood model of the object. The original pattern {{has to be made}} slightly larger as metal shrinks when it cools and often the pattern made in puzzle like parts as the <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> must be [...] "rammed up" [...] in a certain manner and the parts of the pattern must be removed from the <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> without altering the negative space which is left behind in the sand. Pattern makers also have evolved into cutting negative spaces into blocks of steel where sheet metal will be pressed between two matching shapes. A dinner fork is a good example. A block of steel is made to mirror the back of the fork and a block of steel is made to mirror the top of the fork.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal casting is both gravity- and pressure-independent {{since it}} creates its own force feed using a {{temporary}} <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> {{held in a}} spinning chamber at up to 900 N. Lead time varies with the application. Semi- and true-centrifugal processing permit 30-50 pieces/hr-mold to be produced, with a practical limit for batch processing of approximately 9000 kg total mass with a typical per-item limit of 2.3-4.5 kg.|$|E
50|$|During casting, {{some of the}} {{components}} of the sand mixture are lost in the thermal casting process. Green sand can be reused after adjusting its composition to replenish the lost moisture and additives.

50|$|A flask {{is a type}} of tooling used {{to contain}} a mold in metal casting. A flask has only sides, and no top or bottom, and forms a frame around the mold, which is {{typically}} made of molding sand. The shape of a flask may be square, rectangular, round or any convenient shape. A flask can be any size so long as it is larger than the pattern being used to make the <b>sand</b> <b>mold.</b> Flasks are commonly made of steel, aluminum or even wood.

50|$|Hubley's {{casting process}} {{involved}} several steps. For a particular toy, bookend, or doorstop, metalworkers would first carve a wood form, or hammer out the basic design in metal. Pressing this form into finely compacted sand created an impression for molding. Cast iron heated to 3000 degrees was {{poured into the}} <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> and, when cooled, the form would pop out. Rough edges would be filed away and the mold ready for mass production casting. Painters applied a base coat (usually white or cream but sometimes black) to cast figures whether toys or doorstops. Then, colorists {{used a variety of}} hues highlighting important details (Collectics.com).|$|E
5000|$|When {{the pattern}} is {{to be removed from}} the <b>sand</b> <b>mold,</b> there is a {{possibility}} that any leading edges may break off, or get damaged in the process. To avoid this, a taper is provided on the pattern, so as to facilitate easy removal of the pattern from the mold, and hence reduce damage to edges. The taper angle provided is called the Draft angle. The value of the draft angle depends upon the complexity of the pattern, the type of molding (hand molding or machine molding), height of the surface, etc. Draft provided on the casting is usually 1 to 3 degrees on external surfaces ( [...] 5 to 8 internal surfaces).|$|E
50|$|Ben Tré {{utilizes}} {{his training}} as an industrial manufacturing master technician to create glass artworks based on traditional methods. His studio space, located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, {{is a former}} glass product manufacturing plant. He creates fine art castings by pouring molten glass into sand molds, applying heat and then cooling them for months. The form is then dug out from the <b>sand</b> <b>mold,</b> sand blasted, cut, ground, and polished. Many of Ben Tré's works involve the use of gold leaf; by way of wrapping portions of works or installing lead bars within the pieces covered with gold leaf. The glass sculptures are often symmetrical. His wife, Gay, assists in the designing and planning of his large scale works, including the installation of his public art.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} {{automatic}} horizontal flask lines the sand was shot or slung {{down on the}} pattern in a flask and squeezed with hydraulic pressure of up to 140 bars. The subsequent mold handling including turn-over, assembling, pushing-out on a conveyor were accomplished either manually or automatically. In the late fifties hydraulically powered pistons or multi-piston systems {{were used for the}} sand compaction in the flasks. This method produced much more stable and accurate molds than it was possible manually or pneumatically. In the late sixties mold compaction by fast air pressure or gas pressure drop over the pre-compacted <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> was developed (sand-impulse and gas-impact). The general working principle for most of the horizontal flask line systems is shown on the sketch below.|$|E

50|$|During the production, samples may {{be taken}} from the metal and poured into small molds. A chill wedge is often poured to monitor the iron quality. These small, approx 18 mm (3/4") wide x 38 mm (1-1/2") tall {{triangular}} shaped pieces are allowed to cool until the metal has solidified. They are then extracted from the <b>sand</b> <b>mold</b> and quenched in water, wide end first. After cooling in this manner the wedges are fractured and the metal coloration is assessed. A typical fracture will have a whitish color towards the thin area of the wedge and grayish color towards the wide end. The width of the wedge {{at the point of}} demarcation between the white and gray areas is measured and compared to normal results for particular iron tensile strengths. This visual method serves as a control measurement.|$|E
50|$|The DISAMATIC <b>sand</b> <b>molding</b> {{process has}} several {{advantages}} comparing to other molding processes. It {{does not use}} flasks, which avoids a need of their transporting, storing and maintaining. It is fully automatic and requires only one monitoring operator, which reduces labor costs. <b>Molding</b> <b>sand</b> consumption can be minimized due to variable mold thickness that can be adjusted to the necessary minimum.|$|R
5000|$|Sand casting, {{also known}} as <b>sand</b> <b>molded</b> casting, is a metal casting process {{characterized}} by using <b>sand</b> as the <b>mold</b> material. The term [...] "sand casting" [...] can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries. Over 70% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S (DISA-DISAMATIC) {{invented a}} flask-less molding process by using {{vertically}} parted and poured molds.
