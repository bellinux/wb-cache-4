Irrigation wells pumping ground water from the floodplain aquifer reduce stream flows that are both necessary for the viability of San Pedro riparian ecosystem, and claimed by downstream Indian tribes. They also contribute to the ground-water overdraft situation in the regional aquifer.

40|$|This paper compares {{a stylized}} {{version of a}} basic income flat tax system (BI/FT) with a means tested {{graduated}} tax system (MT/GT), with particular attention paid to potential labor supply effects of taxes. A highly simplified simulation model is developed in which individuals are homogeneous except for the wage they face, {{and there is a}} single means-tested benefit. In this model, moving towards universal benefits can raise labor force participation and such effects can outweigh the labor <b>supply</b> <b>reductions</b> of working taxpayers. The number of losers is found to be quite small relative to the number of winners. If a fully universal system is not adopted, a move towards it, by reducing the taper on means tested benefits at the expense of a higher tax rate, can lead to significant winners without losers. These findings {{do not appear to be}} sensitive to assumptions about the individuals' utility function defined over income and leisure. Copyright 2002 by The Economic Society of Australia. ...|$|R

Here, we compare the performances and costs of three methodologies for the monitoring of nutrients in rivers: grab sampling; time-proportional sampling; and passive sampling using flow-proportional samplers. Assuming hourly time-proportional sampling {{to be the best}} estimate of the "true" nutrient load, our results showed that the risk of obtaining wrong total nutrient load estimates by passive samplers is high despite similar costs as the time-proportional sampling. Our conclusion is that for passive samplers to provide a reliable monitoring alternative, further development is needed. Grab sampling was the cheapest of the three methods and was more precise and accurate than passive sampling. We conclude that although monitoring employing time-proportional sampling is costly, its reliability precludes unnecessarily high implementation expenses...|$|R
