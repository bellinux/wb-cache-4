40|$|The UK Biodiversity Action Plan and the EC Habitats Directive aim to {{conserve}} {{specific types of}} habitat by means of action plans and <b>site</b> <b>protection</b> <b>measures.</b> In order to set natural resources in context, to enable planning to be effective and to facilitate the costing of proposals for action, {{it is necessary to}} know the extent of each habitat type. The total surface area of standing fresh water in Great Britain is estimated at 2400 km 2. The aim of the investigation described here is to estimate the extent of the different types of standing freshwater habitat that make up this total. Freshwater habitat classification systems used in Britain and the European Union incorporate the concept of trophic levels. The current British system, {{based on the results of}} a nationwide botanical survey of standing waters, groups ten standing water site types under the broad habitat categories dystrophic, oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic and brackish. Data collected by the statutory nature conservation agencies on site type (and therefore habitat type) and surface area are available for 3500 water bodies, mostly in Scotland. In England and Wales, survey has been much more selective and patchy than in Scotland. Therefore, it was not considered possible to estimate the areas of habitat types in England and Wales (or in Britain as a whole) simply by direct extrapolation from the survey sample to the total resource of standing water. Computerised national datasets available to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) include Ordnance Survey (OS) statistics on the area of standing water in each kilometre square in Great Britain and records of the occurrence of aquatic plant species in the Biological Records Centre (BRC) database. A system of Trophic Ranking Scores (TRS) has been developed for aquatic plant species. Using BRC data, a mean TRS for each 10 x 10 km square in Britain was produced and the country was divided into TRS bands. For each of these bands the percentage by surveyed area of each freshwater habitat type (dystrophic, oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic) was calculated. These percentages were applied to the total area of standing water in each TRS band and the extent of these habitats in Britain as a whole could then be calculated. ...|$|R

We appreciate the opportunity to comment. NMFS expects that existing Class II-L <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> (Table 1) will adequately protect listed anadromous salmonids from most timber operations. However, we remain concerned that Class II-S <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> may {{not be sufficient to}} reduce adverse impacts to listed anadromous salmonids from timber operations. The goal ofthe proposed rule isnot to change these <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> but rather clarify the methods for which a Registered Professional Forester (RPF) distinguishes the difference between a Class II-L and a Class II-S. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the watercourse <b>protections</b> <b>measures</b> that are required in the California Forest Practice Rules (CFPRs) 916. 9 (g) (2) et seq.

40|$|In {{the article}} modern {{scientific}} and theoretical positions concerning {{determination of the}} effectiveness of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> on agricultural lands are investigated. It is analyzed that the protection of land from degradation {{is one of the most}} important problems of agriculture, as this process leads to a significant decrease in soil fertility and crop yields. That is why in today's conditions, when the protection of agricultural land became urgent and a priority task, the scientific substantiation of the economic assessment of the damage caused by the degradation of land to agriculture, as well as the development of methods for determining the economic efficiency of the most progressive soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures,</b> technologies and complexes based on their overall Comparative evaluation. It was established that ground <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> are a system of various measures aimed at reducing the negative degradation effect on the soil cover and ensuring the preservation and reproduction of soil fertility and integrity, as well as increasing their productivity as a result of rational use. The economic essence of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> is the economic effect achieved by preventing damage caused by land degradation to agriculture, as well as for obtaining additional profit as a result of their action. The economic effectiveness of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> means their effectiveness, that is, the correlation between the results and the costs that they provided. The excess of the economic result over the cost of its achievement indicates the economic efficiency of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures,</b> and the difference between the result and the expenditure characterizes the economic effect. Ecological efficiency is characterized by environmental parameters of the soil cover, namely: the weakening of degradation effects on soils; improvement of their qualitative properties; An increase in production without violation of environmental standards, etc. Economic efficiency reflects the use of land resources when performing soil protection requirements. Social efficiency is determined by the improvement of social organizational and territorial conditions of population living: preventing losses of clean products due to soil contamination; reduction of payments from the social insurance fund; Reduction of expenses of the society for treatment of workers in connection with pollution of soils, etc. When introducing soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures,</b> a soil <b>protection</b> effect is necessary under the condition of an increase in productive capacity of the land only if it is differentiated according to the soil, relief, climatic conditions and specialization of agricultural enterprises with the obligatory application of anti-degradation measures. Therefore, in today's environment, the organization and planning of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> should take place on the basis of a regional program-targeted approach. Its essence consists in analyzing the initial state of the region, identifying problems and formulating the goal, identifying their priorities. This makes it possible to make an effective decision on the implementation of an optimal set of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures.</b> Consequently, the general criteria for the economic evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} the system of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> are the preservation and improvement of the qualitative characteristics of agricultural land and the environment and the increase of production per unit of land at the least cost. Indicators of economic efficiency of various types of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> play an important role in the design and implementation of soil <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> against degradation. With the proposed approaches, the relevant bodies of land relations, in particular, when developing projects and other documentation on land management, as well as directly landowners and land users, can reasonably plan some or other measures and allocate the necessary material resources for their implementation. This ensures the restoration of degraded lands and the timely prevention of degradation processes...|$|R
