Dalton pointed out that a <b>small</b> <b>column,</b> {{travelling}} in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital patients, would be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior Zulu force, and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight.|$|E

25|$|The Allies had {{originally}} planned to bypass Paris, to avoid street fighting {{and the necessity}} of feeding a huge population. However, when news of the uprising in Paris reached them, Generals Eisenhower and Bradley agreed to send the French 2nd Armored Division of General Leclerc to Paris, and sent the American 4th Armored Division to support them. The 2nd Armored Division set out early in the morning of August 23 with 16,000 men, 4,200 vehicles and 200 tanks. By the afternoon of the 24th, they were in the western and southern Paris suburbs. On 23 August, Leclerc had sent a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> of three tanks and eleven halftracks, commanded by Captain Dronne, to enter the heart of the city. By 9:00p.m. Dronne had reached the Hôtel de VIlle, where he was greeted by Georges Bidault, the head of the National Council of the Resistance (Conseil national de la Résistance), and André Tollet, commander of the Paris committee of liberation (Comité parisien de la Libération). Then he went to the Prefecture of Police for a meeting with de Gaulle's representative, Chaban-Delmas. The main force of Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division entered the city {{on the morning of the}} 25th. There was fierce resistance near the Invalides and the École Militaire, in which some French soldiers were killed and tanks destroyed. By the end of the morning, the Germans had been overcome and a large French tricolor flag was hoisted on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

[...] The Zaians and other local tribes, eventually numbering 5,000 men, began to converge on the French column and began harassing its flanks and rear. [...] The French artillery proved ineffective against dispersed skirmishers and at the Chbouka river the rearguard and gun batteries found themselves cut off and overrun. [...] Laverdure detached a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> of troops to take his wounded to Khénifra, remaining behind {{with the rest of}} the force.

500|$|At dawn, Saint-Cyr (French right) {{advanced}} {{along the}} Elz valley. Nauendorf prepared {{to move his}} Habsburg forces down the valley. Seeing this, Saint-Cyr sent a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> across {{the mountains to the}} east of the main valley, to the village of Simonswald, located in a side valley. He instructed them to attack Nauendorf's left, and to force him to withdraw from Bleibach. Anticipating this, though, Nauendorf had already posted units on the heights along the Elz valley, from which Austrian shooters ambushed Saint-Cyr's men. On {{the other side of the}} Elz valley, more Habsburg gunmen reached Kollnau, which overlooked Waldkirch, and from there they could fire down on the French force. The fighting was swift and furious. The superior Austrian positions forced Saint-Cyr to cancel his advance on Bleibach and withdraw to Waldkirch; even there, though, Nauendorf's men continued to harass him, and Saint-Cyr retreated another [...] to the relative safety of Denzlingen.|$|E

40|$|Complex, caddisfly-dominated (Insecta: Trichoptera) {{carbonate}} mounds up to 9 m {{tall and}} 40 m in diameter {{formed in the}} nearshore environment of Eocene Lake Gosiute. The mounds outcrop for 70 km in reef-like geometries along the northern margin of Lake Gosiute in Wyoming. The relationships among the caddisfly larvae, the benthic microbial mat and physicochemical nearshore processes of Eocene Lake Gosiute resulted in unique external and internal carbonate mound morphology. Externally, the large carbonate mounds are formed by the lateral and vertical coalescence of several layers of <b>smaller</b> <b>columns.</b> The <b>smaller</b> <b>columns</b> are generally 1 – 2 m tall and are 0. 5 – 1 m in diameter. Each layer or generation of <b>smaller</b> <b>columns</b> tends to have a unique external morphology. This suggests that variable paleoenvironmental conditions produced subtle differences in tufa and stromatolite morphology. Internally, each of the <b>smaller</b> <b>columns</b> is composed of a core of caddisfly larval cases surrounded by layers of tufa and stromatolites. The <b>smaller</b> <b>column</b> cores are characterized by centimeter thick microbial-caddisfly couplets in which layers or packets of calcified caddisfly larval cases are covered by microbial mat-mediated, microlaminated carbonate. The microbial-caddisfly couplets suggest that both metazoans and microbes were responsible for column height and shape. In this paper, we propose a mechanism {{for the growth of}} these caddisfly-dominated mounds.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known published {{reference for}} the word Wicca is within an advertisement published in a 1962 issue of Fate magazine; in this, a Cardiff-based group of Pagan Witches advertised a tradition as [...] "Wicca–Dianic and Aradian". The advert may {{have been linked to}} Charles and Mary Cardell because Mary was allegedly born in Wales and Cardellian Witchcraft had apparently venerated a goddess under the name of Diana. However, many Pagan Witchcraft groups would have adopted the deity name Diana and Aradia, these being the goddesses featured in the American folklorist Charles Leland's supposed account of a Tuscan witch tradition, Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches (1899). Another early use could be found from December 1965, in the penultimate issue of Pentagram, the newsletter of the Witchcraft Research Association. Here, a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> on Halloween made reference to [...] "the Craft of the Wiccan", apparently referring to the entire Pagan Witchcraft community. The author's name was not printed, although it had probably been produced by one of the figures involved in editing Pentagram, such as Gerard Noel or Doreen Valiente. In July 1968, a group of British Gardnerians began publishing a magazine titled The Wiccan, while Welshman Gavin Frost founded the Church of Wicca in the United States that same year.|$|E
2500|$|With {{ammunition}} {{running low}} and the artillery suffering badly in casualties to men and horses Lieutenant Colonel Ellice ordered a withdrawal.

[...] Concurrently the events of the day had been telegraphed to the garrison at Rawl Pindi as events had unfolded and a Colonel was despatched to replace the wounded Lieutenant Colonel Ellice and a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> of reinforcements of the 24th was dispatched under the command of Lieutenant Holland.|$|E
2500|$|Cippus is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a <b>small</b> <b>column,</b> which is at times truncated. Cippi serve as milestones, funerary monuments, markers or votive offerings. [...] The earliest cippi had a cubic shape, and were carved from sandstone. By the late fifth century BC, these became gabled delicate stelae in the Greek fashion. The Maltese marble cippus is about [...] high at the highest point, and is broken at the top. [...] The Louvre Cippus is currently [...] high at its highest point, [...] wide, and [...] thick. [...] "Their form is light and gracefully executed..." [...] with a [...] "...Greek inscription upon the pedestal,a masterpiece of Phoenician epigraphy." [...] The artifacts are carved in white marble, a stone which is not found naturally in the Maltese islands. As {{it is unlikely that}} skilled marble-carvers were available, they were probably imported in their finished state. The inscriptions, however, were probably engraved in Malta on behalf of the two patrons, Abdosir and Osirxamar. Judging by the names on the main inscription, the patrons were of Tyrian extraction. The addition of a synopsis of the dedication in Greek, with the names of the dedicators and of Melqart given in their Hellenised versions, confirms the existence and influence of Hellenistic culture. Additionally, while Malta had been colonised by the Phoenicians since the 8th century BC, by the second century, the Maltese islands were under Roman occupation. The use of Phoenician script also confirms the survival of Phoenician culture and religion on the islands.|$|E

2500|$|A {{light rain}} was falling and {{visibility}} was poor when, {{half an hour}} before morning twilight, Tunny began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20fathoms (37m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, Tunny continued the approach until she was only [...] from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, Tunny submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with a thud, but without explosion, and a <b>small</b> <b>column</b> of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, Tunny managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded Tunnys third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from [...] as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, Tunny dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.|$|E
