5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> as a primary influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a <b>single</b> <b>factor,</b> such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, and interest rates.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{reservoir}} parameters’ synthetic variation on oilfield development rules is the consolidated reflection of each <b>single</b> <b>factor’s</b> effect on oilfield development rules. These <b>single</b> <b>factors</b> include porosity, permeability, and relative permeability. In positive rhythm formations, as the variance coefficient increases, the synthetic influence of reservoir parameters on oil development rules weakens gradually. However, in reverse rhythm formations, the synthetic influence on oil development rules has a peak when the variance coefficient is different. As oil viscosity increases, {{the negative impact}} of permeability variation on production performance can be further aggravated, and the synthetic influence is that the difference in recovery prediction when considering or neglecting the variability of reservoir parameters weakens.|$|R
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a <b>single</b> <b>factor.</b> Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} <b>single</b> <b>factor,</b> responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 32 {{studies to}} determine whether patient-related factors predict the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of hospitalized patients. Limitations of individual studies are described. <b>Single</b> <b>factors</b> and multiple factors, as used in the Pre-arrest Morbidity (PAM) Index, were examined {{for their ability to}} predict CPR outcome. Although certain clinical conditions appear to predict CPR survival best, other individual patient-related factors influence the effectiveness of CPR. The PAM Index is superior to <b>single</b> <b>factors</b> in predicting survival after CPR in hospitalized patients, possibly because it is multifactorial. As some studies reveal efficacy of only some of the variables of the PAM Index, a modification of the PAM Index is proposed as an effective tool for predicting CPR outcome.

25|$|Spearman's {{argument}} {{proposing a}} general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians.

No <b>single</b> <b>factor</b> unambiguously accounts for all radiations, diversification, and extinctions; however, the broader patterns of taxonomic diversification and morphological disparity point to niche differentiation in a “fishing up” scenario {{under the influence of}} “bottom-up” selective pressures.
