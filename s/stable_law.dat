Abstract: <b>Stable</b> <b>laws</b> play {{a central}} role in the {{convergence}} problems of sums of independent random variables. In general, densities of <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> are represented by special functions, and expressions via elementary functions are known only for a very few special cases. The convenient tool for investigating the properties of <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> is provided by integral transformations. In particular, the Fourier transform and Mellin transform are greatly useful methods. We first discuss the Fourier transform and we give overview on the known results. Next we consider the Mellin transform and its applicability on the problem of the product of two independent random variables. We establish the density of the product of two independent stable random variables, discuss the properties of this product den- sity and give its representation in terms of power series and Fox's H-functions. The fourth chapter of this thesis is focused on the application of <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> into option pricing. In particular, we generalize the model introduced by Louise Bachelier into <b>stable</b> <b>laws.</b> We establish the option pricing formulas under this model, which we refer to as the Lévy Flight [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} {{a family of}} chaotic dynamical systems with explicit broad distributions, which always violate the central limit theorem. In particular, we show that the superposition of many statistically independent, identical random variables obeying such chaotic process converge in density to Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> in {{a full range of}} the index parameters. The theory related to the connection between deterministic chaos and non-Gaussian distributions gives us a systematic view of the purely mechanical generation of Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws.</b> 1 The central limit theorem (CLT) breaks down when any stationary stochastic process has infinite variance. Thus, it is an important question whether this mathematically pathological situation is physically relevant or not. One noteworthy point arising from recent studies is that such examples of Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws,</b> which are the most famous class of distributions for violating the CLT, can be seen in many different fields, such as astronomy, physics, biology, economics and communication engineering, under broad conditions [1 – 4]. Thus, it is our primary interest to determine why such Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> are widely observed, and furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism of generating Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws.</b> In the 1980 ’s, there were several studies which clarify the relation between intermittent periodic mapping and anomalous diffusion with Lévy’s law-like broad distributions [5, 6]. Random-walk models [7] and combinations of several random number generators [8, 9] are also utilized to generate Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws.</b> However, such analysis includes approximations or the non-deterministic nature in their models themselves, or their generation methods are only applicable to a special class of Lévy’s <b>stable</b> <b>laws.</b> The purpose of the present paper is to present a systematic method for exact and purely mechanical generation of <b>stable</b> <b>laws</b> with arbitrary indexes only using concrete chaotic dynamical systems.
