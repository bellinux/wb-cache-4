40|$|The {{national}} variant of language is studied as a metasystem of all {{variations of the}} national language, as a parity form of language existence and adapting to its functioning conditions. In the article the paradigmatic class of lexical items in the Austrian {{national variant}} of German, which are used to evaluate a person {{in terms of their}} mental abilities, are studied. The inner structure of this class incorporates two subclasses of lexical items, which actualize positive and negative evaluations. The onomasiological approach allows to define <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> as nomination motivating factors. <b>Subject</b> <b>codes</b> point to identification spheres of a certain object, generate images and metaphorical shifts, allow to determine the elements of the mental processes and their features relevant for positive or negative evaluation. The results of linguistic analysis reveal that in comparison to the negative evaluation, the positive one is less completely represented in the lexical and semantic system of the Austrian national variant of German. Relevant features for an evaluative description of person's mental abilities are temporal and qualitative characteristics of mental processes, quantitative characteristics of objects, qualitative characteristics of a person, such as age, physical, social and gender. The most productive <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> are objective, zoological, botanical, physiological and anatomical codes.

E. Holmstrom, 1948 The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' - filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and '30s - that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy, Desk Set. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|With text {{categorization}} it {{is possible}} to access information within a large pile of impure data. It also helps people to save time who wants to have information more easily and practically. One of the most important practical research areas in terms of text categorization is news, as it has a potential of rapid increase. This thesis aims to investigate the connection of <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> with named entities, in terms of text categorization, by using 5834 news texts which were obtained from BilCol- 2005 news corpus. To address this, 5834 news were tagged with seven different named entities (person, organization, location, date, time, money and percentage). Tagged news were classified under 13 different <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> of IPTC's (International Press Telecommunications Council) main subject taxonomies. The investigation was based on tagged and untagged words and their relations with the IPTC news codes. Key findings were revealed with the frequency and percentage values along with some statistical tests (e. g. Mann Whitney U test, Chi-square test). Findings showed that the most and the least dominant named entitity in the corpus was "Person" and "Time", respectively. Besides, it was also revealed that the number of tagged words differed according to <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> where "Person", "Organization" and "Location" named entities were prominent among all subjects. Moreover, it was seen that the conceptual content of the <b>subject</b> <b>codes</b> were reflected more by untagged words than the ones tagged with named entities. These findings supported our hypothesis. This study is important {{because it was the first}} in the related Turkish literature in which the connection between an international standard news taxonomy (IPTC) and named entities was investigated. The findings are believed to be useful for journalists, for the news taxonomists and for those who need to access the news texts fast and accurately.

For a specified inlet total temperature, inlet total pressure, and exit static pressure, the code computers the flow rates through the main branch and the subbranches, flow through tip cap for impingement cooling, in addition to computing the coolant pressure, temperature, and heat transfer coefficient distribution in each coolant flow branch. Predictions from the <b>subject</b> <b>code</b> for both nonrotating and rotating passages agree well with experimental data.

The undecidability of the theory of the partial ordering R = hR; 6 i of the c. e. degrees was rst proved by Harrington and Shelah [5], using a very complicated 0 000 argument.

40|$|International audienceImplicit {{invocation}} languages, like aspect-oriented languages, automate the Observer pattern, which decouples subjects (base code) from handlers (advice), {{and then}} compound {{them together in}} the final system. For such languages, event types have been proposed {{as a way of}} further decoupling subjects from handlers. In Ptolemy, subjects explicitly announce events at certain program points, and pass the announced piece of code to the handlers for its eventual execution. This implies a mutual dependency between subjects and handlers that should be considered in verification; i. e., verification of <b>subject</b> <b>code</b> should consider the handlers and vice versa. However, in Ptolemy the event type defines only one obligation that both the handlers and the announced piece of code must satisfy. This limits the flexibility and completeness of verification in Ptolemy. That is, some correct programs cannot be verified due to specification mismatches between the announced code and the handlers’ code. For example, when the announced code does not satisfy the specification of the entire event and handlers must make up the difference, or when the announced code has no effect, imposing a monotonic behavior on the handlers. In this paper we propose an extension to the specification features of Ptolemy that explicitly separates the specification of the handlers from the specification of the announced code. This makes verification in our new language PtolemyRely more flexible and more complete, while preserving modularity...|$|E
