500|$|Despite much prepublicity, Harlow {{received}} a lukewarm response from critics: Variety referred to Baker's portrayal of Harlow as [...] "a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original." [...] Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: [...] "I'll <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> Joe Levine: I admire his taste in leading ladies," [...] which led {{the press to}} suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine over her contract with Paramount Pictures in 1966, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from Harlow frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded $1 million in compensation).|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> anything and everything. We could <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E

On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that.

60|$|There are two {{paths of}} folly in these matters. One is to regard all Indian matters, Indian {{procedure}} and Indian policy, {{as if it}} were Great Britain or Ireland, and to insist that all the robes and apparel that suit Great Britain or Ireland must necessarily suit India. The other is to think that all you have got to do is what I see suggested, to my amazement, in English print--to blow a certain number of men from guns, and then your business will be done. Either of these paths of folly leads to as great disaster as the other. I would like to <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>about</b> the Summary Jurisdiction Bill--I have no illusions whatever. I do not ignore, and I do not believe that Lord Lansdowne opposite, or anyone else can ignore, the frightful risks involved in transferring in any form or degree what should be the ordinary power under the law, to arbitrary personal discretion. I am alive, too, to the temptation under summary procedure of various kinds, to the danger of mistaking a headstrong exercise of force for energy. Again, I do not for an instant forget, and I hope those who so loudly applaud legislation of this kind do not forget, the tremendous price that you pay for all operations of this sort in the reaction and the excitement that they provoke. If there is a man who knows all these drawbacks I think I am he. But there are situations in which a responsible Government is compelled to run these risks and to pay this possible price, however high it may appear to be.|$|E
