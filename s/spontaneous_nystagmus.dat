50|$|Alexanders law {{refers to}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> that occurs after an acute {{unilateral}} vestibular loss. It was first described in 1912 and has three elements {{to explain how}} the vestibulo-ocular reflex responds to an acute vestibular insult. The first element says that <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> after an acute vestibular impairment has the fast phase directed toward the healthy ear. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is named for the fast phase, so the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> is directed toward the healthy ear. The second element says nystagmus is greatest when gaze is directed toward the healthy ear, is attentuated at central gaze and may be absent when gaze is directed toward the impaired ear. The third element says that <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> with central gaze is augmented when vision is denied. This became apparent with the implementation of electrographic testing.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{potassium}} channel blocker 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) on <b>spontaneous</b> upbeat <b>nystagmus</b> (UBN) was investigated with the search coil technique during fixation in different gaze positions and smooth pursuit in a patient before and after ingestion of 10 mg 4 -AP. UBN was reduced from 8. 6 deg/s to 2. 0 deg/s by 4 -AP causing subjective relief from distressing oscillopsia, and impaired upward smooth pursuit was restored (gains: before medication 0. 38; after medication 0. 86). In the dark, UBN was slightly stronger and not affected by 4 -AP.

40|$|Instead of the hot-and-cold caloric test {{proposed}} by Hallpike in 1942, the mono-thermal caloric test with assessment of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> has gained wide acceptance, {{because of its}} convenience, and stronger stimuli; however, no clinical evidence has been reported. The intensity of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> changes in maximum of 9. 5 times according to recording conditions, i. e., with the eyes closed, during mental arithmetic, or with the eyes open in darkness, in our 57 patients suffering from vertigo. The same caloric stimulus can cause inverse caloric responses when tested in supine or in prone positions. In order to evaluate the clinical significance of the mono-thermal caloric test, first, a supine/prone mono-thermal caloric test was compared to the hot-and-cold caloric test in 5 normal subjects and 10 vertigo patients with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> showing good correlation (100 % coincident as canal plasty (CP) -diagnosis) with these two methods. Second, the best condition for measuring <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> was determined by comparing the CP% of supine/prone caloric test and caloric test with consideration of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> in 57 patients with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> resulted in taking the largest <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> of any condition. CP% was correlated in the mono-thermal caloric test and the supine/prone caloric test in 89. 5 %, indicating the criminal evidence of the mono-thermal caloric test. Those who did not coincide were patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and the central vestibular disease. In conclusion, the supine/prone mono-thermal caloric test is clinically useful for excluding the influence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> The discrepancy of CP diagnosis in the supine/prone test and supine alone suggested non-endogens involvement...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and objective: Clinical otoneurological {{examination}} {{is usually}} initiated by oculomotor examination. This exploration {{allows us to}} evaluate static signs, such as <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> and dynamic signs such as post head-shaking nystagmus, mastoid vibration nystagmus or oculocephalic impulse test. The objective of this review will be to expose the physiopathological bases of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> and the head-shaking test {{as well as its}} clinical utility. Method: It is a narrative review where we select the bibliography that we consider most relevant for this objective. Results: We describe nystagmus as the involuntary and rhythmic movement of the eyes which appears spontaneously or provoked by different stimuli. The exploration of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> in the 5 positions of the look, as well as its characteristic, is the fundamental tool in the initial assessment of a dizzy patient, followed by performing different maneuvers that can make it to manifest or to modify.

We were interested in describing and demonstrating the clinical features and videonystag-mographic findings of this peculiar nystagmus. Case A 26 -year-old woman {{was admitted to the}} neurologic clinic because of blurred vision and disequilibrium. She had been well until two months earlier, when she had fever, headache, and vomiting. She progressively became drowsy and examination revealed stuporous mental status, anisocoria (3 mm/ 4 mm) with sluggish response to light, a right beating nystagmus and neck stiffness. Brain MRI showed increased signals in bilateral ventral midbrain, posterior limb of the internal capsules, and dorsal aspect of the right thalamus (Fig. 1). A provisional diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was made and antiviral agent was started. One week after admission, her symptoms markedly improved, but were followed by blurring of vision, with severe dizziness and gait instability. On examination, right beating nystagmus, severe hand tremor and gait imbalance were noted. She was referred to our hospital. There was no family history of neurologic disease. Right and left pupil diameters were 3 and 5 mm, respectively, and right pupil reacted promptly but the left pupil sluggishly to light. Visual acuity was 0. 8 / 0. 63 in each eye.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to apply videonystagmography (VNG) and {{vestibular}} evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) tests to patients with Meniere attacks, to explore the mechanics of where saccular disorders may affect the semicircular canals, Methods: From January 2001 to December 2003, 12 consecutive patients with unilateral definite Meniere's disease with vertiginous attacks underwent VNG for recording <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> as well as VEMP tests. Results: At the very beginning of the Meniere attack, the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> beat toward the lesion side in 5 patients (42 %) and toward the healthy side in 7 patients (58 %). Twenty-four hours later, only 6 patients (50 %) showed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> beating toward the healthy side. Nevertheless, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> subsided in all patients within 48 hours. The VEMP test was performed within 24 hours of a Meniere attack; the VEMPs were normal in 4 patients and abnormal in 8 patients (67 %). After 48 hours, 4 patients with initially abnormal VEMPs had resolution and return to normal VEMPs, and the other 4 patients still had absent VEMPs. Conclusions: Most patients (67 %) with Meniere attacks revealed abnormal VEMPs, indicating that the saccule partici-pates in a Meniere attack.

The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate some parts of the centralvestibular system using some subtests of videonystagmographic evaluation, including <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> gaze-evoked nystagmus, and smooth pursuit between their attacks of migraine Methods: Thirty patients with migraine and 38 healthy volunteers of 18 - 48 years of age were included in this study. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> gaze-evoked nystagmus toward the right, left and upward, and also smooth pursuit using three different velocities were performed in both groups. Results: Five normal subjects and five migraine patients had <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> which was less than three degrees; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. No gazeevoked nystagmus was seen in both groups. In one velocity of smooth pursuit evaluation, gain and phase were significantly different. The statistical difference in gain and phase was not clinically important as it was in normal range of the device. Another statistically significant parameter was saccadic morphology of smooth pursuit which was seen in migraine patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} cerebellar dysfunctions and quantitatively characterize specific oculomotor {{changes in}} ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the MRE 11 gene. Additionally, to further elucidate the pathophysiology of cerebellar {{damage in the}} ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) spectrum disorders. Methods: Saccade dynamics, metrics, and visual fixation deficits were investigated in two Italian adult siblings with genetically confirmed ATLD. Visually guided saccades were {{compared with those of}} 40 healthy subjects. Steady fixation was tested in primary and eccentric positions. Quantitative characterization of saccade parameters, saccadic intrusions (SI), and nystagmus was performed. Results: Patients showed abnormally hypermetric and fast horizontal saccades to the left and greater inaccuracy than healthy subjects in all saccadic eye movements. Eye movement abnormalities included slow eye movements that preceded the initial saccade. Horizontal and vertical <b>spontaneous</b> jerk <b>nystagmus,</b> gaze-evoked, and rebound nystagmus were evident. Fixation was interrupted by large square-wave jerk SI and macrosaccadic oscillations. Conclusion: Slow eye movements accompanying saccades, SI, and cerebellar nystagmus are frequently seen in AT patients, additionally our ATLD patients showed the presence of fast and hypermetric saccades suggesting damage of granule cell-parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses of the cerebellar vermis.

40|$|Abstract Cerebral {{infarction}} presenting with isolated vertigo {{remains a}} diagnostic challenge. To define the clinical characteristics of unilateral infarctions {{restricted to the}} ves-tibular nuclei, two patients with isolated unilateral vestibular nuclear infarction had bedside and laboratory evaluation of the ocular motor and vestibular function, including video-oculography, bithermal caloric irrigation, the head impulse test (HIT) using magnetic scleral coils, and cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs). We also reviewed the literature on isolated vertigo from lesions restricted to the vestibular nuclei, and analyzed the clinical features of seven additional patients. Both patients showed <b>spontaneous</b> torsional-horizontal <b>nystagmus</b> that beat away from the lesion side, and direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus. Recording of HIT using a magnetic search coil system documented decreased gains of the vestibular-ocular reflex for the horizontal and posterior semicircular canals on both sides, but more for the ipsilesional canals. Bithermal caloric tests showed ipsilesional canal paresis in both patients. Cervical and ocular VEMPs showed decreased or absent responses during stimulation of the ipsilesional ear. Initial MRIs including diffusion-weighted images were normal or equivocal, but follow-up imaging disclosed a circumscribed acute infarction {{in the area of}} the vestibular nuclei. Infarctions restricted to the vestibular nuclei may present with isolated vertigo with features of both peripheral and central vestibulopathies. Central signs should be sought even in patients with spontaneous horizontalâ€“torsional nys-tagmus and positive HIT. In patients with combined peripheral and central vestibulopathy, a vestibular nuclear lesion should be considered especially when hearing is preserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the horizontal optokinetic reaction (OKR) and response properties of retinal slip neurons in {{the nucleus of}} the optic tract and dorsal terminal nucleus (NOT-DTN) of albino and wild-type ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). In contrast to pigmented ferrets, we were unable to observe OKR in albino ferrets during binocular and monocular viewing using random dot full field stimulation and electrooculography (EOG). Observations during early postnatal life indicate that regular OKR is present in pigmented pups 3 d after eye opening but is absent at any stage during development in albino ferrets. Unilateral muscimol injections to inactivate all neurons in the NOT-DTN containing GABAA and GABAC receptors caused <b>spontaneous</b> horizontal <b>nystagmus</b> with slow phases away from the injected hemisphere in albino as well as in pigmented animals. Retinal slip neurons in the NOT-DTN of albino ferrets identified by antidromic activation from the inferior olive and orthodromic activation from the optic chiasm were well responding to intermittent bright light stimuli, but many showed a profound reduction of responsiveness to moving stimuli. The movement-sensitive neurons exhibited no clear direction selectivity for ipsiversive stimulus movement, a characteristic property of these neurons in pigmented ferrets and other mammals. Thus, the defect rendering albino ferrets optokinetically nonresponsive is located in the visual pathway subserving the OKR, namely in or before the NOT-DTN, and not in oculomotor centers.

40|$|Alexanderâ€™s law (AL) {{states that}} the slow-phase {{velocity}} of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> of peripheral vestibular origin is dependent on horizontal gaze position, with greater velocity when gaze is directed in the fast-phase direction. AL {{is thought to be}} a compensatory reaction resulting from adaptive changes in the horizontal ocular motor neural integrator. Until now, only horizontal eye movements have been investigated with respect to AL. Because <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> usually includes vertical and torsional components, we asked whether horizontal gaze changes would {{have an effect on the}} 3 D drift of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> and, thus, on the vertical/torsional neural integrator. We hypothesized that AL reduces all nystagmus components proportionally. Moreover, we questioned the classical theory of a single bilaterally organized horizontal integrator and searched for nonlinearities of AL implying a network of multiple integrators. Using dual scleral search coils, we measured AL in 17 patients with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> Patients followed a pulsed laser dot at eye level jumping in 5 Â° steps along the horizontal meridian between 25 Â° right and left in otherwise complete darkness. AL was observed in 15 of 17 patients. Whereas individual patients typically showed a change of 3 D-drift direction at different horizontal eye positions, the average change in direction was not different from zero. The strength of AL (= rate of change of total velocity with gaze position) correlated with nystagmus slow-phase velocity (Spearmanâ€™s rho[*]=[*] 0. 5; p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and, on average, did not change the 3 D nystagmus drift direction. In general, eye velocity did not vary linearly with eye position. Rather, there was a stronger dependence of velocity on horizontal position when subjects looked in the slow-phase direction compared to the fast-phase direction. We conclude that the theory of a simple leak of a single horizontal neural integrator is not sufficient to explain all aspects of AL...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to elucidate {{the role of the}} nucleus of the optic tract and the dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system (NOT-DTN) for slow eye movements other than horizontal. Retinal slip neurons in the NOT-DTN in the awake behaving cat respond direction selectively to the ipsiversive component of horizontal and oblique image motion. They are, however, influenced neither by pure vertical stimulus movement nor by eye movements in the dark. Electrical stimulation of the NOT-DTN leads to pure horizontal optokinetic nystagmus with ipsiversive slow phases and does not influence vertical eye position. In addition, unilateral reversible inactivation of the NOT-DTN with muscimol elicits <b>spontaneous</b> contraversive horizontal <b>nystagmus</b> without vertical component. During oblique optokinetic stimulation, the ipsiversive OKN component is significantly decreased in all directions. After bilateral NOT-DTN inactivation, OKN can only be elicited in a narrow range of upward directions. These data indicate that the NOT-DTN is the only source to drive the horizontal component of OKN...|$|R

Patients with congenital PAN complain of oscillating vision at high rates. Medication is the first-choice treatment for PAN; however, clinicians still seek better therapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate outcomes of recession of four horizontal rectus muscle (R-FHR) in patients with congenital PAN. Patients and methods: This study reports a retrospective case series of ten patients (seven males and three females; mean age 24. 4 Â± 10. 9) with congenital PAN who underwent R-FHR between 2007 and 2012, which was performed by the same surgeon at the Hyogo College of Medicine. Patients were evaluated for complications, recession amount, deviation angle, eye movements including a nystagmus amplitude, and visual acuity during pre- and post-operative periods. Results: Pre-operatively, patients complained of oscillating vision, abnormal head posture, esotropia, and congenital superior oblique palsy. Post-operatively, changes from the previous observations of nystagmus amplitudes and abnormal head posture demonstrated a complete reversal in all patients. In addition, visual acuity determined with a Snellen chart improved in two patients. However, esotropia occurred in three patients who underwent additional strabismus surgery 2 days after R-FHR. R-FHR was particularly effective in eight patients who pre-operatively had periodic oscillating vision with a regular pattern of periodic nystagmus.

Therefore, a concurrence of the two conditions can be expected in about 1. 1 % of the general population by chance alone. However, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that the actual comorbidity is higher, namely 3. 2 %. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that several dizziness and vertigo syndromes occur more frequently in migraineurs than in controls including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniereâ€™s disease, motion sickness, cerebellar disorders and anxiety syndromes which may present with dizziness. In addition, there is increasing recognition of a syndrome called vestibular migraine (VM), which is vertigo directly caused by migraine. VM affects more than 1 % of the general population, about 10 % of patients in dizziness clinics and at least 9 % of patients in migraine clinics. Clinically, VM presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days. Migrainous accompaniments such as headache, phonophobia, photophobia or auras are common but not mandatory. Cochlear symptoms may be associated but are mostly mild and non-progressive. During acute attacks one may find central <b>spontaneous</b> or positional <b>nystagmus</b> and, less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. In the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing adds little to the diagnosis as findings are mostly minor and non-specific. In the absence of controlled studies, treatment of VM is adopted from the migraine sphere comprising avoidance of triggers, stress management as well as pharmacotherapy for acute attacks and prophylaxis...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: Topical Substance P (SP) {{application}} facilitates {{recovery from}} vestibular disorders induced by (Â±) -Î±-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl-isoxazole- 4 -propionic acid (AMPA) in guinea pigs and may offer a treatment strategy {{for patients with}} peripheral vestibular disorders. Methods: Sixteen Hartley white guinea pigs were assigned to groups administered with SP and artificial perilymph. A hole was drilled adjacent to a round window and AMPA was infused into the hole to induce a vestibular disorder. Thereafter, SP or artificial perilymph was delivered via an osmotic pump inserted into the hole. We observed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> and measured vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) gains using sinusoidal rotation tests. Results: <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> decreased immediately after SP infusion, and the gain ratios {{were significantly higher than}} those in the control group at 3 and 7 days after treatment. Conclusion: Topical SP application facilitates recovery from AMPA-induced vestibular disorders in guinea pigs...|$|E
40|$|MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s attack {{has been}} shown to {{temporarily}} alter the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). A patient with unilateral MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s disease was serially evaluated with the video Head Impulse Test during single, untreated episodes of acute vertigo. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus</b> activity was concurrently recorded in order to establish the three typical phases of MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s attack (irritative, paralytic, and recovery) and correlate them with VOR performance. The onset of attack was associated with a quick change in VOR gain {{on the side of the}} affected ear. While a rapidly progressive reduction of the VOR was evident at the paralytic nystagmus phase, in the recovery phase the VOR gain returned to normal and the direction of the previous nystagmus reversed. The membrane rupture potassium intoxication theory provides a good foundation with which to explain these dynamic VOR changes and the observed triphasic direction behavior of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> We additionally postulated that endolymphatic fluid displacement could have a synergic effect during the earliest phase of attack...|$|E

40|$|The Aryl {{hydrocarbon}} Receptor or AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor, {{is known}} to mediate the toxic and carcinogenic effects of various environmental pollutants such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Recent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster show that the orthologs of the AhR are expressed exclusively in certain types of neurons and are implicated {{in the development and}} the homeostasis of the central nervous system. While physiological roles of the AhR were demonstrated in the mammalian heart, liver and gametogenesis, its ontogenic expression and putative neural functions remain elusive. Here, we report that the constitutive absence of the AhR in adult mice (AhR 2 / 2) leads to abnormal eye movements {{in the form of a}} <b>spontaneous</b> pendular horizontal <b>nystagmus.</b> To determine if the nystagmus is of vestibular, visual, or cerebellar origin, gaze stabilizing reflexes, namely vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes (VOR and OKR), were investigated. The OKR is less effective in the AhR 2 / 2 mice suggesting a deficit in the visuo-motor circuitry, while the VOR is mildly affected. Furthermore, the AhR is expressedin the retinal ganglion cells during the development, however electroretinograms revealed no impairment of retinal cell function. The structure of the cerebellum of the AhR 2 / 2 mice is normal which is compatible with the preserved VOR adaptation, a plastic process dependent on cerebellar integrity. Finally, intoxication with TCDD of control adults did not lead to any abnormality of the oculomotor control. These results demonstrate that the absence of the AhR leads to acquired central nervous syste...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{establish}} an animal model of sudden onset {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SSNHL) to study its mechanisms. Materials and methodsThe inner ear was exposed to 3 -nitropropionic acid at 0. 5 mol/L (3 -NP (H)) and 0. 3 mol/L (3 -NP (L)) through the round window membrane for 30 minutes in 50 male guinea pigs. Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses(ABR) were established before the treatment and retested at 4 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 6 days following 3 -NP exposure. Control animals were treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and their ABRs were retested at 4 hours and 1 day after the treatment. Animals were monitored for nystagmus and postural signs of vestibular dysfunction, using a digital video camera, following the treatment procedure. Specimens were taken at 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days following 3 -NP(H) exposure and embedded in JB 4 for light microscopy observation. ResultsABRs were lost in all animals tested at 4 hours following 3 -NP (H) exposure. The rate of complete ABR loss decreased as post-treatment test time increased. ABRs were lost in 80 % (4 / 5) of the animals at 1 day after exposure to 3 -NP (L). <b>Spontaneous</b> horizontal <b>nystagmus</b> with a fast phase away from the treated ear developed in all 3 -NP (H) -treated animals and in 20 % (1 / 5) of the animals exposed to 3 -NP (L), except for the one treated bilaterally. Various degree of postural disturbances consistent with unilateral vestibular dysfunction, such as spontaneous barrel rolling towards the exposure side while walking, were seen in all animals exposed to 3 -NP(H) and 40 % (2 / 5) of animals exposed to 3 -NP(L), except for the one animal treated bilaterally, which {{showed no signs of}} imbalance. Both nystagmus and postural disturbances resolved in 2 days following 3 -NP exposure. Histological study showed temporary edema tin the organ or Corti, Claudius cells and the inner sulcus cells 3 days after 3 -NP (H) treatment. Enlargement of intercellular space in the spiral prominence was first noticed at 12 hours post- 3 -NP (H) exposure, progressed at day 3 and recovered at day 7. Vacuoles in the cellular plasm and nucleus was seen as early as at 12 hours post- 3 -NP exposure in the spiral ganglion cells, and signs of degeneration were visible at day 7. ConclusionInner ear exposure to 3 -NP through the round window membrane appears to reproduce clinic manifestations and may serve as a legitimate animal model of SSNH...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the presence of}} IgG autoantibodies against the P 0 antigen in patients affected by sudden hearing loss and Meniere's disease (MD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients underwent a tonal audiometric evaluation, tympanometry, evaluation of the stapedial reflex threshold with decay time, determination of auditory brainstem responses and a complete vestibular assessment involving evaluation of <b>spontaneous</b> and positional <b>nystagmus</b> (Frenzel glasses), a head thrust test and a caloric test (Fitzgerald-Hallpike technique). Blood samples were drawn from all patients for the immunologic assessment of IgG antibodies against the P 0 antigen (30 -kDa protein) of guinea pig inner ear extracts using a Western blot assay. RESULTS: Ten patients affected by sudden hearing loss showed specific IgG antibodies against the P 0 protein. Specifically, the P 0 positive band was detectable in 5 / 45 patients with unilateral auditory impairment and in 5 / 5 of those with bilateral forms of auditory impairment. Among MD patients, the P 0 positive band was detectable only in those with bilateral audiovestibular impairment (n = 10). Interestingly, in none of the 35 patients affected by monolateral MD were specific IgG antibodies against the P 0 protein detectable. CONCLUSION: The positive reactions to P 0 in all bilateral MD and bilateral sudden hearing loss patients {{found in this study}} strongly indicate that these pathologies are the result of an ongoing autoimmune process directed against specific antigens of the inner ear.
