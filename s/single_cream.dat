It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum of 55 percent, but an average of 64 percent); in the United States it would be classified as butter. For comparison, the fat content of <b>single</b> <b>cream</b> is only 18 percent.|$|E

6000|$|I was never, I confess, one {{of those}} who are willing to suppose the brains of an author {{to be a kind of}} milk, which will not stand above a <b>single</b> <b>creaming,</b> and who are {{eternally}} harping to young authors to husband their efforts, and to be chary of their reputation, lest it grow hackneyed in the eyes of men. Perhaps I was, and have always been, the more indifferent to the degree of estimation in which I might be held as an author, because I did not put so high a value as many others upon what is termed literary reputation in the abstract, or at least upon the species of popularity which had fallen to my share; for though it were worse than affectation to deny that my vanity was satisfied at my success in the department in which chance had in some measure enlisted me, I was, nevertheless, far from thinking that the novelist or romance-writer stands high in the ranks of literature. But I spare the reader farther egotism on this subject, as I have expressed my opinion very fully in the Introductory Epistle to the Fortunes of Nigel, first edition; and, although it be composed in an imaginary character, it is as sincere and candid as if it had been written [...] "without my gown and band." ...|$|R

5000|$|Double cream {{champagne}} is {{a coat of}} {{any color}} affected by champagne and both copies of the cream gene. Unlike the coat colors associated with only a <b>single</b> <b>cream</b> gene, double cream champagnes (respectively prefixed with [...] "gold," [...] "amber," [...] etc.) retain no obvious champagne traits.

The Presence of at least 1 Dun gene will result in a grullo colored coat (Black Dun).

50|$|Smoky {{black is}} a hair coat color of horses {{in which the}} coat is either black or a few shades lighter than true black. Smoky black is {{produced}} {{by the action of}} a heterozygous (<b>single</b> copy) <b>cream</b> gene on an underlying black coat color. Therefore, smoky black {{is a member of the}} cream family of coat color dilutions, and found in horse populations that have other cream gene-based colors such as palomino, buckskin, perlino and cremello. All smoky blacks must have at least one parent with the cream gene, and a smoky black can be verified through DNA testing. Smoky black has been mistaken for faded black, dark bay or brown, grullo or even liver chestnut.|$|R

Glaswegians typically use canned evaporated milk and jam. Use of whisky, rum, or sherry have been reported. Cooking time can be adjusted to preference, but simmering for ten minutes is typical for non-instant oatmeal. Instant oatmeal, including flavored instant oatmeal, is common and can be prepared with the application of hot water.|$|E

When it thickened to the consistency of <b>single</b> <b>cream,</b> the clay was channelled through pipes to settling tanks where it continued to dry for up to 3 months.Lastly, it was spread across the Pan Kiln’s floor made of porous pan tiles that allowed the heat through to finish drying.|$|E

While in Woodstock in November, Harrison established a long-lasting friendship with Bob Dylan and experienced a creative equality among the Band that contrasted sharply with John Lennon and Paul McCartney's domination in the Beatles. Coinciding with this visit was a surge in Harrison's songwriting output, following his renewed interest in the guitar, after three years spent studying the Indian sitar.

50|$|Horses {{with both}} the {{champagne}} gene and the cream gene {{are the most common}} combination. The cream gene is responsible for the palomino, buckskin and cremello coat colors, and is a dose-dependent or incomplete dominant, meaning that a horse with only one copy is visibly different from a horse with two copies of the gene. A single copy of the cream gene dilutes red pigment in the coat to gold or yellow, and has a slight effect on the skin and eye color. The black pigment is lightened little, if at all. Two copies of the cream gene dilute both red and black pigments in the hair to cream or ivory, dilute the skin to a rosy-pink and the eyes to pale blue. The cream gene and champagne gene have an additive or enhancing interaction. Horses with the champagne gene and a <b>single</b> <b>cream</b> gene typically have lighter yellowish or blue eyes and paler, more faintly freckled skin.|$|E
50|$|The company's most {{recognisable}} ident however {{is the one}} {{launched in}} 1969. Called Zoom 2, it was the ident that heralded colour to the region for the first time. Starting with three lightspots that grow individually and combine to form six colours and the caption 'In Colour', the three lightspots fully merge forming a <b>single</b> <b>cream</b> dot which then animates out into the ATV shadowed eye, fully formed, in yellow, while the background dissolves from white to dark blue. The score for the ident featured four trumpets, four trombones, drums and vibraphone in a twelve beat fanfare for the station, by Jack Parnell and arranged by Wally Stott. In addition to this, a variation was produced which only featured a black dot growing and transforming into the white shadowed eye for programmes still being shown in black and white. This ident was used from the introduction of colour in 1969 right until the ATV name ceased {{to be used in}} 1982.|$|E

Could Teaching Trailers help you wisely chose among prospective teachers, similar to how movie trailers allow you to screen films for Friday-night worthiness? To determine if students can forecast which teachers would be uniquely effective, 6 -minute Teaching Trailers were created for 9 guest lecturers. Students rated the Teaching Trailers and subsequent live lectures, providing estimates of perceived effectiveness and current mood. Quizzes captured retention of guest lecture content. Data collection is complete, and data analyses are ongoing. It {{is not uncommon for}} students to seek out resources such as ratemyprofessor. com when making course selections.
