40|$|Abstract. There {{are several}} methods for {{starting}} a complex mechanical system, for example a liquid propellant engine. One of common methods {{is the use}} of solid propellant gas generator that is named <b>solid</b> propellant <b>starter.</b> In this method, a solid propellant motor is used for gas generating and leading it towards power generation turbine. The turbine as an active element, rotates one or several pumps for providing propellants with suitable head and rate for consumers such as liquid propellant gas generator and combustion chamber. After moving of pumps and reaching to nominal conditions, the start system stops. Therefore in order to suitable and optimized designing of starter, the essential parameter is taking into account the downstream resistance of system. In a complex system such as a liquid propellant engine, the start system {{is one of the main}} and important components of engine and it’s operation affects directly on the other components of engine.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} the characteristics and chemical composition of different silages based on sweetpotato vines in combination with several local feed resources was conducted in the Animal Science laboratory at the Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute, Kabanyolo (MUARIK). Sweetpotato vines from variety NASPOT 11 were used. Maize bran and cassava root were used as ferment starters (additives) during the ensiling process. The silages were analyzed for pH, moisture content, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, ether extracts and ash, calcium and phosphorus. The results showed that sweetpotato vines can produce silage of acceptable quality even when no external ferment starter is added. However, addition of a <b>solid</b> ferment <b>starter</b> like maize bran served to absorb the moisture that would accumulate as effluent {{at the bottom of}} the silo and eventually lead to spoilage. The dry matter content of the silage was low (> 24 %) and would not meet the requirements of young growing pigs. The resultant silage had crude protein content higher than 19 percent and would meet the requirements for growing pigs except for the balance of essential amino acids and low dry matter of the material. For efficient utilization, feeding sweetpotato silage diets would require supplementation to satisfy requirements for dry matter and essential amino acids.

Therefore, he was traded by the MetroStars to the San Jose Clash (later to be named the Earthquakes) in exchange for Rhett Harty and first round pick in 1996 College Draft. He was a <b>solid</b> <b>starter</b> for the Clash until, in August 1997, he suffered a violent collision snapping his head backwards.

Nonetheless, in October 1997, he underwent surgery that fused a piece of bone from Troy's hip onto his 5th and 6th vertebrae. After a long march to recovery, he rejoined the Clash in 1998, going on loan to the San Francisco Bay Seals for one game, only to be waived {{at the end of the}} season. In 1999 Dayak signed with the San Francisco Bay Seals of the A-League. Early in the 1999 season, Dayak suffered a major knee injury damaging his medial collateral ligament (MCF) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).

A <b>solid</b> propellant <b>starter</b> is a <b>solid</b> propellant motor that instead of thrust, momentum of its exit gases is used for rotating the turbine. The values of power and operating time of starter, are specified from downstream conditions of the start system. Generally, the type and efficiency of turbine and pumps, propellant rate and density, control mechanisms in the path of propellant and etc, are determinant of these values. In this type of start system, gases due to combustion, pass through a convergent-divergent nozzle and enter the turbine and rotate it. In this paper, with due consideration to the role and importance of start system in the process of LPE operation, in order to better recognition of present phenomena in this system, the flow due to combustion in a start system that uses solid propellant, has been simulated via solving the navier-stokes equations. These equations have been expressed in the form of time-dependent, axisymmetric, compressible and viscous and have been solved by means of finite volume methods in company with continuity and energy equations. For finite volume methods the domain is divided up into a number of control volumes, with the value at the centre of the control volume being held to be representative for the value over the entire control volume.

The viability of LAB after freeze drying with sour cassava starch matrix was 92 % of the liquid starter, with lintnerized cassava starch matrix was 93 %, while that with nanocrystalline matrix was 96 %. After application of the LAB culture during settling process for tapioca extraction and the tapioca was stored {{at room temperature for}} 6 months, it was shown that E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella were  detected in the native tapioca starch (without treatment) while the starch added with lactic acid bacteria starter was not absent for the pathogenic bacteria. The addition of lactic acid bacteria in extraction process can suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria in tapioca. The results showed that lintnerized cassava starch matrix is the best matrix because after 6 months it still contained lactic acid bacteria as compared to liquid starter and that encapsulated with other matrixes. </p...|$|E
