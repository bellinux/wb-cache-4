500|$|On May 19, 2011, Ocean's {{record label}} Def Jam {{announced}} {{its plans to}} release an EP containing tracks from nostalgia, Ultra. Ocean announced that the re-release would have been titled Nostalgia, Lite {{and that it was}} expected to feature seven tracks. The EP was originally scheduled to be released on July 26, 2011, however, Ocean noted on his official Tumblr page on July 24, 2011 that Nostalgia, Lite would no longer be released on July 26 and that the project was cancelled. Both [...] "Swim Good" [...] and [...] "Novacane" [...] were set to be featured on the release. Talking about which other songs would make it onto the reissue, Ocean commented that [...] "The Eagles sample 'American Wedding' has no chance in hell of being cleared". He continued, [...] "Coldplay sample 'Strawberry Swing', possibly. I hear 'possibly' from people who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> MGMT, those guys seem chill. I heard they heard the record 'Nature Feels' and they liked it a lot, so hopefully that can go someway." [...] Other tracks on the reissue were set to be [...] "Acura Integurl", which appeared on the unofficial release The Lonny Breaux Collection, and [...] "Whip Appeal" [...] which was released in 2012. In 2012, Ocean commented again on his blog that [...] "Nostalgia Lite is [...] "never coming out." ...|$|E

Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{truth is}} that we fear to die because all the {{religions}} are full of uncomfortable hints as to what may happen to us afterwards {{as a reward for}} our deviations from their laws and we half believe in something, whereas often the savage, not being troubled with religion, fears less, because he half believes in nothing.
