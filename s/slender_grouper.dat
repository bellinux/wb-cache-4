50|$|Anyperodon is a genus {{of large}} marine ray-finned {{fish in the}} grouper family. Anyperodon leucogrammicus, the <b>slender</b> <b>grouper,</b> is the only species in the genus. It is found in {{tropical}} parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>slender</b> <b>grouper</b> is {{considered}} of [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This {{is because it}} has a very wide range and populations {{do not seem to be}} in decline. It is not fished commercially but is occasionally seen in the fish markets in Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slender</b> <b>grouper</b> {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. The range extends from {{the east coast of}} Africa and the Red Sea at 32°E to southern Japan and Australia at 171°W. It is found on coral reefs and seaward reef slopes and in lagoons at depths down to 50 m or occasionally 80 m. and can found in Andaman Sea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slender</b> <b>grouper</b> is carnivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} other fish such as {{goatfish}} but possibly also on invertebrates. Juvenile slender groupers are aggressive mimics of the red-lined wrasse, Halichoeres biocellatus and the silty wrasse, Halichoeres purpurescens. They resemble them in appearance and in behaviour which lulls a potential prey fish into {{a false sense}} of security and enables the grouper to approach it without detection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slender</b> <b>grouper</b> is {{a medium}} fish growing to {{a length of}} about 65 cm. The head {{occupies}} 40% of the total length and the mouth is large, with the lower jaw longer than the upper jaw. There are no palatine teeth, a fact which distinguishes this species from other groupers. The basic colour is pale reddish-brown liberally dotted with orange spots which are closer together on the head. There are five pale silvery blue longitudinal lines running down either side, the lower 3 reaching the tail but the upper two breaking into irregular streaks. The dorsal fin has 11 spines and 14 to 16 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 8 to 9 soft rays. Juvenile fish have vivid blue and red longitudinal stripes.|$|E
