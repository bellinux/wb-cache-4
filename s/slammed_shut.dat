25|$|Named as {{a member}} of the West Indian team to tour Australia in 1951/52, Weekes was troubled by a range of {{injuries}} throughout the tour, including an ongoing thigh injury and a badly bruised right thumb when a door <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> on it while he was helping an injured Walcott out of his room, subsequently leaving his performances below expectations.|$|E
25|$|The first Type 192 {{prototype}} XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, {{a completely}} manual control {{system and a}} castored, fixed quadricycle undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> by the downwash from the rotors. This {{was replaced by a}} sliding door on the later aircraft.|$|E
25|$|After his {{hospitalization}} Barkhorn {{was invited}} by Adolf Galland {{to join the}} elite Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-fighter. He found flying the Me 262 over the western front difficult {{and he did not}} score any victories in it. On 21 April 1945, he flew his 1,104th and last mission. One of the engines of his aircraft flamed out as he was approaching an enemy bomber formation and he was forced to make an emergency landing. As he approached the airfield, his jet was attacked by several prowling North American P-51 Mustang fighters. Barkhorn managed to land his burning plane though he received a slight wound {{as a result of this}} action when the cockpit canopy — which on the Me 262A, flipped open to starboard, like a Bf 109's did — prior to crash landing, <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> on his neck. Taken prisoner by the Western Allies while still in hospital, he was released from Allied captivity in September 1945.|$|E

500|$|Kate {{made her}} own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was {{probably}} taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio {{doors at the}} back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> as {{though there was a}} draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming [...] "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!" ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the door}} <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> {{on them by}} their old allies, Native American {{resistance}} quickly collapsed. Delegates from the various confederation tribes, 1130 persons total, gathered for a peace conference at Fort Greene Ville in June 1795. The conference lasted for six weeks, resulting, on August 3, 1795 in the Treaty of Greenville between the assembled tribes and the [...] "15 fires of the United States." [...] Under its terms, the tribes ceded most {{of what is now}} Ohio for American settlement, recognized the United States (rather than Great Britain) as the ruling power in the region, and turned ten chiefs over to the U.S. government as hostages until all white prisoners were returned in guarantee. This, along with the recently signed Jay Treaty, which provided for the British withdrawal from pre-Revolutionary War forts in the region it had not yet relinquished, solidified U.S. sovereignty over the Northwest Territory.|$|E
500|$|Now what's {{going to}} happen? You'll {{probably}} start seeing game data files becoming encrypted {{and the open}} door on assets getting <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> just to keep modders from financially screwing the company they should be helping. And the day a game company's file encryption is hacked to add porn and the case goes to the ESRB for review– that's when we'll see how well game companies are protected from these antics and what the courts will rule. Hopefully it'll be on the developer's side. When the ratings change came, Zenke saw political caution in the move, rather than an intelligent response to new content. Previous scandals had forced the Board's hand, and the ratings change {{was an act of}} self-preservation. Zenke, writing in June 2007 for online gaming magazine The Escapist, criticized the public for its failure to respond to the rating change, and emphasized what the change would mean to moddable games. At the core of Zenke's article was concern that a developer or publisher could be punished for content they neither produced nor distributed. Echoing Romero's concerns, Zenke saw the rating change as a threat, not only to modders, but to developers as well. Zenke asked what the ESRB would do in response to [...] "Game 3.0" [...] concepts, where community involvement is key. Referring to Sony's LittleBigPlanet, Zenke asked, [...] "Will Sony provide personnel to review every fan-made level for offensive content? Will the ESRB?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1994 I was a {{relatively}} new and young bishop when the now famous Conference of Bishops was convened at the Antiochian Village, and so together with another young bishop, His Grace Seraphim of Ottawa and Canada, I {{was appointed to the}} Conference's secretariat. Ligonier '94 was without doubt one of the brightest momentsif not THE brightest momentin the history of Holy Orthodoxy in the New World. Dozens of bishops met and prayed and deliberated on that Pennsylvania mountain-top, while hundreds of thousands of our young people across the continent prayed and fasted that we might accomplish a good for Holy Orthodoxy. And, by God's grace, a great good was indeed accomplished! The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly and all too quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again. May that breeze come quickly! ...|$|E
50|$|A dashpot is {{a common}} {{component}} in a door closer {{to prevent it from}} <b>slamming</b> <b>shut.</b> A spring applies force to close the door, and the dashpot forces fluid to flow through an orifice between reservoirs (the orifice is often adjustable), which slows the motion of the door.|$|R

6000|$|... "Let us {{get into}} the barn," [...] {{suggested}} Roger, and flung open a door that was handy. Into the building they went pell-mell, Dave being the last to enter. One dog made a dart at the youth's leg, but Dave gave him a kick that sent him back. Then the door was <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> and latched, and the students found themselves in utter darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! {{what are}} you doing here?" [...] cried Stowell in sudden surprise. [...] "You're the fellow who's playing the trick on me, eh? I'll fix you, you see if I don't!"

[...] he shouted.|$|E
6000|$|So the Giantess {{walked to}} the door by which our friends had entered the great hall and spoke one word: [...] "Open!" [...] Then the door swung open and after Mrs. Yoop had passed out it closed again with a snap as its {{powerful}} bolts shot into place. The Green Monkey had rushed toward the opening, hoping to escape, but he was too late and only got a bump on his nose as the door <b>slammed</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of pulsejets. The first {{is known as a}} valved or {{traditional}} pulsejet and it has a set of one-way valves through which the incoming air passes. When the air-fuel is ignited, these valves <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> which means that the hot gases can only leave through the engine's tailpipe, thus creating forward thrust.|$|R

60|$|The {{door of the}} pen {{was being}} opened again. White Fang paused. Something unusual was happening. He waited. The door was opened wider. Then a huge dog was thrust inside, and the door was <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> behind him. White Fang {{had never seen such}} a dog (it was a mastiff); but the size and fierce aspect of the {{intruder}} did not deter him. Here was some thing, not wood nor iron, upon which to wreak his hate. He leaped in with a flash of fangs that ripped {{down the side of the}} mastiff's neck. The mastiff shook his head, growled hoarsely, and plunged at White Fang. But White Fang was here, there, and everywhere, always evading and eluding, and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again in time to escape punishment.|$|E
6000|$|A chair {{stood near}} the window, and this--showing dimly in the moonlight--gave him an idea. By pushing against it with all his might, he found he could move the giant chair a few inches at a time. So he pushed and pushed until the chair was beneath the bird-cage, and then he sprang noiselessly upon the seat--for his monkey form enabled him to jump higher than he could do as a boy--and {{from there to the}} back of the chair, and so managed to reach the cage and take it off the peg. Then down he sprang to the floor and made his way to the door. [...] "Open!" [...] he commanded, and at once the door obeyed and swung open, But his voice wakened Mrs. Yoop, who gave a wild cry and sprang out of bed with one bound. The Green Monkey dashed through the doorway, {{carrying}} the cage with him, and before the Giantess could reach the door it <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> and imprisoned her in her own bed-chamber! ...|$|E
60|$|SCENE--The stokehole. In the rear, the dimly-outlined bulks of the {{furnaces}} and boilers. High overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds {{just enough}} {{light through the}} murky air laden with coal dust to pile up masses of shadows everywhere. A line of men, stripped to the waist, is before the furnace doors. They bend over, looking neither to right nor left, handling their shovels {{as if they were}} part of their bodies, with a strange, awkward, swinging rhythm. They use the shovels to throw open the furnace doors. Then from these fiery round holes in the black a flood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are outlined in silhouette in the crouching, inhuman attitudes of chained gorillas. The men shovel with a rhythmic motion, swinging as on a pivot from the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into the flaming mouths before them. There is a tumult of noise--the brazen clang of the furnace doors as they are flung open or <b>slammed</b> <b>shut,</b> the grating, teeth-gritting grind of steel against steel, of crunching coal. This clash of sounds stuns one's ears with its rending dissonance. But there is order in it, rhythm, a mechanical regulated recurrence, a tempo. And rising above all, making the air hum with the quiver of liberated energy, the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces, the monotonous throbbing beat of the engines.|$|E
