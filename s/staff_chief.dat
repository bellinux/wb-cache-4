5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General <b>Staff</b> (<b>chief</b> of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared {{an appreciation of the}} situation. Berryman also attempted to find out as much as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was {{assistant}} {{chief of staff}} for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of <b>staff,</b> <b>chief</b> of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army. He was promoted to major general in 1972, and would serve in the GSFG {{for the better part of}} the decade. He was appointed commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army in August 1973, after which he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1974, and became First Deputy Commander in July 1975. He left East Germany to command the Siberian Military District in January 1979, and was promoted to colonel general that year, moving westwards again to lead the Leningrad Military District in November 1981. On 7 May 1986, Snetkov was promoted to army general.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1958, Wells was {{appointed}} the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional {{head of the}} Australian Military. The position had previously existed as an extension to {{the responsibilities of the}} senior service chief—either the Chief of Naval <b>Staff,</b> <b>Chief</b> of the General Staff or Chief of the Air Staff—but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the Australian government's response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the Minister for Defence, Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the Navy, Army and Air Force. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger—who had been appointed to the position in 1961—was promoted to air chief marshal so that he out-ranked the service heads. Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.|$|E

25|$|Recovering {{from his}} wounds but still unfit for active service, Slim was {{temporarily}} employed on the General Staff at GHQ in Delhi.

By early May 1941 Slim had been appointed Brigadier General <b>Staff</b> (<b>chief</b> staff officer) to Edward Quinan the commander designate for operations in Iraq, arriving in Basra on 7 May. Not long afterwards, Major-General Fraser, commanding Indian 10th Infantry Division, fell ill and was relieved of his command, and Slim was promoted to take his place on the 15 May 1941 in the acting rank of major-general. He led the Indian 10th Infantry Division as part of Iraqforce during the Anglo-Iraqi War, the Syria-Lebanon Campaign (where the division advanced up the river Euphrates to capture Deir ez-Zor), and the invasion of Persia.

25|$|Entering the Austrian {{military}} service, Zach {{became a}} Major in 1788, an Oberstleutnant in 1793, and an Oberst in 1795.

In June he was succeeded by Franz von Lauer when Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser replaced Beaulieu. Subsequently, {{he served on}} Paul Davidovich's staff during the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September. In 1797, Zach served on a commission to analyze the reasons for Austria's defeat. He noted that lower-ranking generals displayed little initiative because {{there were too many}} regulations. He found that regimental officers showed more interest in pay and privilege and drill than in learning how to make fighting units more efficient. He saw that officers were indifferent toward the rank and file, and that the lower ranks had little trust or enthusiasm for their leaders.|$|E

25|$|Within the army, {{organisation}} {{and theory}} had no obvious link with war planning and responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became de facto Commander-in-Chief if war began but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. These commanders were {{independent of the}} General <b>Staff</b> <b>Chief</b> and trained soldiers {{according to their own}} devices. The German system of government was federal and the ministries of war of the constituent states controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, when the possibility increased of another Volkskrieg, a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies, that had occurred after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases {{in the size of the}} army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create more choices about how to fight a war and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could help make up for numerical inferiority against a Franco-Russian coalition and smash fortifications. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable so that it was better than its potential enemies and rapidly could win a decisive victory.|$|E

When New Guinea Force split into a rear headquarters under Blamey and an advanced headquarters under Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, so the latter could go forward to direct the Battle of Buna-Gona, Blamey brought Berryman up from Advanced LHQ in Brisbane to simultaneously act as chief of staff of New Guinea Force from 11 December 1942. Berryman formed a very close professional and personal relationship with Blamey, and henceforth Berryman would be Blamey's chief of staff and head of operational planning, which made him [...] "one of the most important officers in the Australian Army in its struggle against the Japanese." ...|$|E
