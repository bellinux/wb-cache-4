25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be tears as well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> how they walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E
500|$|Neighbors in Evergreen Park later {{described}} the Kaczynskis as [...] "civic-minded folks", one {{stating that the}} parents [...] "sacrificed everything they had for their children". Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted stood out in particular. One neighbor said she had [...] "never known anyone who had a brain like ," [...] while another commented that Ted was [...] "strictly a loner" [...] who [...] "didn't play... an old man before his time." [...] Wanda recalled Ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation. At one point she was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> Ted's social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by Bruno Bettelheim, but decided against it after observing Bettelheim's abrupt and cold manner.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fourth victory {{of the season in}} front of 110,000 people who attended the race. Johnson also earned $276,076 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I woke up (on Sunday) morning very optimistic. By about lap two or three I knew we had a very balanced car and we'd be competitive all day long, get a solid finish.", he continued, [...] "I see guys get <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what other people think, what other people say and {{spend a lot of time}} in those areas. That's not what works for me. (I) don't watch television; don't watch or read any of the trade papers or magazines. Just ignore, ignore, ignore and focus on my world and what's going on with my race car. That's what I'll do through the rest of the Chase." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Burton was {{unfamiliar}} with Johnny Depp's then-popular performance in 21 Jump Street, {{he had always}} been Burton's first choice. At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting {{to break out of the}} teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp [...] "wept like a newborn" [...] and immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story. In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue. Fox studio executives were <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film. Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in Beetlejuice. Drew Barrymore previously auditioned for the role. Crispin Glover auditioned for the role of Jim before Anthony Michael Hall was cast.|$|E
500|$|Partially {{due to her}} {{experiences}} filming Mermaids, Cher turned down leading roles in such films as The War of the Roses and Thelma & Louise. According to Berman, [...] "After the success of Moonstruck, she was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> her next career move that she was overly cautious." [...] In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10million in fees. The skits were parodied on Saturday Night Live and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told Ladies' Home Journal, [...] "Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things." ...|$|E

500|$|Designer Robert Fletcher {{was brought}} in to {{redesign}} existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of [...] "corrupt colors", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. [...] "They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way their indicate another time." [...] Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed, but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until [...] (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called trapunto. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of The Wrath of Khans production, the machines and needles needed to produce trapunto were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy. He {{became aware}} of the {{differences}} within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as [...] "economists" [...] argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> changing the government. They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper Iskra, or in English, The Spark, which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the Iskra position and began writing for the paper.|$|E

2500|$|Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords {{adopted the}} Irish {{language}} and customs, becoming {{known as the}} Old English, and {{in the words of}} a phrase coined in later historiography, became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves." [...] Over the following centuries they sided with the indigenous Irish in political and military conflicts with England and generally stayed Catholic after the Reformation. The authorities in the Pale grew <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the Gaelicisation of Ireland that, in 1367 at a parliament in Kilkenny, they passed special legislation (known as the Statutes of Kilkenny) banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. Since the government in Dublin had little real authority, however, the Statutes did not have much effect.|$|E
2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)â€”and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal actionâ€”as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Bomis {{planned to}} make Wikipedia a {{profitable}} business. Sanger initially saw Wikipedia {{primarily as a}} tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that, at worst, it might produce [...] "complete rubbish". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, {{who came up with the}} broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative. Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement. Wales has said that he was initially <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awaken during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project. In a talk at SXSW in 2016, he recalled that he wrote the first words on Wikipedia: [...] "Hello world", a phrase computer programmers often use to test new software.|$|E

2500|$|Steven Fish {{calls the}} book [...] "a major {{contribution}} {{to our understanding}} of the postcommunist political predicament" [...] which [...] "will stand the test of time", noting its [...] "searching treatment of the connection between intellectual and political life", [...] "incorporation of cultural conflict into the analysis of politics", [...] "unabashed humanism" [...] and [...] "lyrical style", all of which, he argues, parallel works by Isaiah Berlin and Fouad Ajami. However, he criticizes TismÄƒneanu for his [...] "not strictly correct" [...] conclusion that intellectual former dissidents can be credited with bringing down communism and reforming their countries, replying that the [...] "rough-hewn politicians" [...] Lech WaÅ‚Ä™sa and Boris Yeltsin, and the Bulgarian [...] "pragmatic liberal centrist" [...] Ivan Kostov, are just as important actors. A similar point is made by Cas Mudde, who contends that TismÄƒneanu's words display [...] "passionate and uncritical support for the dissidents", adding: [...] "For someone <b>so</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> populism, it is remarkable that he does not see the clearly populist elements of the dissidents' 'anti-politics', which he so often praises." [...] Political scientist Steven Saxonberg reserves praise for the manner in which Fantasies of Salvation is written, but objects to TismÄƒneanu's preference for market liberalism at the expense of any form of collectivism, and claims that his focus on new antisemitic trends overlooks the revival of antiziganism. Researchers comment favorably TismÄƒneanu's rejection of cultural determinism in discussing the Eastern Bloc countries' relation to the Western world and to each other.|$|E
