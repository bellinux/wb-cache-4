40|$|The {{immunological}} {{responses of}} inbred mice to structural components of one class of endogenous virus were investigated {{by means of}} radioimmunoassays utilizing highly purified viral proteins. Naturally occurring antiviral antibodies were demonstrated only in those strains possessing information for induction of a mouse cell-tropic endogenous virus. Moreover, these antibodies invariably appeared subsequent to the detection of spontaneous replication of this virus in the same animal. The immune responses elicited were much stronger against endogenous viral gp 70 than p 30, consistent with previous findings of tolerance in the mouse to the major <b>structural</b> <b>antigen</b> of its endogenous virus. However, the demonstration of an immune response to p 30 under conditions of both natural and experimental immunization establishes that tolerance to this viral antigen can be overcome...|$|E

The assay was sensitive and displayed little variation within or between assays. Since moderate-risk tumor viruses, such as recently discovered primate oncornaviruses or feline leukemia virus (FeLV), may be hazardous to laboratory personnel, the assay was adapted for containment of cells infected with such viruses. Cells producing gibbon ape lymphoma virus or FeLV were grown in class III containment cabinets and transferred in sealed flasks to a class II laminar-flow cabinet, where the assay was performed. This micromethod not only conserved reagents but also minimized the numbers of moderate-risk tumor virus-infected cells handled at one time. Centrifugation was contained using custom-made devices shown to form a gas-tight seal over microtiter plates.

40|$|A small {{percentage}} of human fibroblast cells survived high-multiplicity infection by cytomegalovirus and were isolated as persistently infected cultures. Approximately 30 % of the cells were in the productive phase of infection, since virus-specific <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> and virions were associated with these cells. The remaining cells contained neither viral <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> nor particles. Nuclear DNA from these nonproductive cells contained approximately 120 genome equivalents of viral DNA per cell as determined by reassociation kinetics. In situ hybridization confirmed that nuclei from nonproductive cells contained {{a significant amount of}} viral DNA that was distributed in most of these cells. Early virus-induced proteins and antigens were also detected. Nonproductive cells continued to grow, and there was a slow, spontaneous transition of some of these cells to productive viral replication. The majority of the viral DNA in nonproductive cells persisted with restricted gene expression. When infectious virus production was eliminated by growing the persistently infected cultures in the presence of anticytomegalovirus serum, approximately 45 genome equivalents of the viral DNA persisted per cell. The reassociation reaction approached completion. After removal of the antiserum and subculturing, infectious virus production resumed. Therefore, it was assumed that all sequences of the viral genome remained associated with these cells. Restriction of cytomegalovirus gene expression in persistently infected cell cultures is discussed...|$|R

At 35 C, the minimum replicative cycle, after synchronous infection of CV- 1 cells with {{multiplicity of infection}} of 135 focusforming units per cell, was 35 hr; however, maximum virus yields were not obtained until 75 hr postinfection (PI). Cytoplasmic incorporation of 3 H-thymidine [viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis] was detected 3 hr PI and was preceded by synthesis of nonstructural associated antigens (YS). Synthesis of YS antigens was not inhibited by the DNA inhibitor, arabinofuranosyl cytosine (ARA-C). Synthesis {{of at least two}} virion <b>structural</b> <b>antigens,</b> although not detected by immunofluorescence until 2 hr after the onset of DNA synthesis, occurred in the presence of ARA-C, indicating potential translation of these <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> from parental DNA.

We aimed here to identify small antigenic determinants of the CHIKV E 2 protein able to induce neutralizing immune responses. E 2 enables attachment of the virus to target cells and a humoral immune response against E 2 should protect from CHIKV infections. Seven recombinant proteins derived from E 2 and consisting of linear and/or <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> were created, and were expressed in and purified from E. coli. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with these recombinant proteins and the mouse sera were screened for neutralizing antibodies. Whereas a linear N-terminally exposed peptide (L) and surface-exposed parts of the E 2 domain A (sA) alone did not induce neutralizing antibodies, a construct containing domain B and a part of the β-ribbon (called B+) was sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, domain sA fused to B+ (sAB+) induced the highest amount of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the construct sAB+ was used to generate a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), MVA-CHIKV-sAB+. Mice were vaccinated with MVA-CHIKV-sAB+ and/or the recombinant protein sAB+ and were subsequently challenged with wild-type CHIKV. Whereas four vaccinations with MVA-CHIKV-sAB+ were not sufficient to protect mice from a CHIKV infection, protein vaccination with sAB+ markedly reduced the viral titers of vaccinated mice.

The transcription factors NF-κB and AP- 1 are activated by rotavirus infection, but the upstream processes leading to these events are largely unidentified. We therefore studied the activation state during rotavirus infection of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38, which are kinases known to activate AP- 1. As assessed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies, infection with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) or exposure to UV-psoralen-inactivated RRV (I-RRV) resulted in the activation of JNK in HT- 29, Caco- 2, and MA 104 cells. Activation of p 38 during RRV infection was observed in Caco- 2 and MA 104 cells but not in HT- 29 cells, whereas exposure to I-RRV {{did not lead to}} p 38 activation in these cell lines. Rotavirus strains SA 11, CRW- 8, Wa, and UK also activated JNK and p 38. Consistent with the activation of JNK, a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the AP- 1 component c-Jun was shown. The interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and c-jun promoters contain AP- 1 binding sequences, and these genes have been shown previously to be transcriptionally up-regulated during rotavirus infection. Using specific inhibitors of JNK (SP 600125) and p 38 (SB 203580) and real-time PCR, we showed that maximal RRV-induced IL- 8 and c-jun transcription required JNK and p 38 activity.

We therefore studied the activation state during rotavirus infection of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38, which are kinases known to activate AP- 1. As assessed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies, infection with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) or exposure to UV-psoralen-inactivated RRV (I-RRV) resulted in the activation of JNK in HT- 29, Caco- 2, and MA 104 cells. Activation of p 38 during RRV infection was observed in Caco- 2 and MA 104 cells but not in HT- 29 cells, whereas exposure to I-RRV {{did not lead to}} p 38 activation in these cell lines. Rotavirus strains SA 11, CRW- 8, Wa, and UK also activated JNK and p 38. Consistent with the activation of JNK, a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the AP- 1 component c-Jun was shown. The interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and c-jun promoters contain AP- 1 binding sequences, and these genes have been shown previously to be transcriptionally up-regulated during rotavirus infection. Using specific inhibitors of JNK (SP 600125) and p 38 (SB 203580) and real-time PCR, we showed that maximal RRV-induced IL- 8 and c-jun transcription required JNK and p 38 activity. This highlights the importance of JNK and p 38 in RRV-induced, AP- 1 -driven gene expression. Significantly, inhibition of p 38 or JNK in Caco- 2 cells reduced RRV growth but not viral <b>structural</b> <b>antigen</b> expression, demonstrating the potential importance of JNK and p 38 activation for optimal rotavirus replication.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a principal}} public health issue in Pakistan. Screening of HCV infection by simple and low-cost diagnostic methods is a key requirement in the planning of antiviral therapies for HCV infected patients. Although several commercial diagnostic assays are available for the screening of both anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA, strategies aimed at the development of simple and inexpensive diagnostic systems for these measurements are still going on. This {{study was designed to}} select, clone and express the antigenic regions of structural genes (Core, E 1 and E 2) from local HCV genotype- 3 a and to utilize the antigenic structural proteins to develop high-sensitive, specific and economical diagnostic assays for detection HCV, which could be utilized for serological screening. Each amplicon of HCV- 3 a structural gene was cloned in TA vector and the inserted fragments were confirmed by colony PCR and sequence analysis. The antigenic sites were determined within each sequenced structural gene and were then cloned in pET- 28 a expression vector. The right orientation of desired inserted fragments was confirmed via sequencing prior to carrying out expression. Recombinant expression vector horbouring antigenic sites for each structural gene was transformed in BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and induced with 0. 5 mM IPTG for the production antigenic structural recombinant proteins. The produced recombinant antigens (Core, E 1 & E 2) were purified by Nickel affinity chromatography. The produced Core, E 1 and E 2 antigens were confirmed by western blot using mouse anti-His 6 monoclonal antibodies and were then tested fortheir immunoreactivity with HCV positive serum samples by immunoassays, immunoblotting and ELISA. The expressed structural antigens were used to develop immunoassays for the detection of genotype-specific antibodies in serum samples. Using each <b>structural</b> <b>antigen</b> in immunoassays for the detection of HCV specific antibodies, a total of 101 sera of known genotypes were screened for the anti-HCV Core, E 1 and E 2 antibodies. Each peptide showed a reaction with anti-HCV total antibody without showing any genotype-specific binding. In the immunoblotting total of 93 -HCV infected sera and 35 -HCV negative individuals were tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies to the Core, E 1 and E 2 antigens. Each structural recombinant antigen showed 100...|$|E
40|$|RUTI is a {{therapeutic}} vaccine that is generated from detoxified and liposomed Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell fragments that has demonstrated its efficacy {{in the control}} of bacillus reactivation after short-term chemotherapy. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the cellular immune response generated after the therapeutic administration of RUTI and to corroborate the lack of toxicity of the vaccine. Mouse and guinea pig experimental models were infected with a low-dose M. tuberculosis aerosol. RUTI-treated animals showed the lowest bacillary load in both experimental models. RUTI also decreased the percentage of pulmonary granulomatous infiltration in the mouse and guinea pig models. This was not the case after Mycobacterium bovis BCG treatment. Cellular immunity was studied through the characterization of the intracellular gamma interferon (IFN-γ) -producing cells after the splenocytes' stimulation with M. tuberculosis-specific <b>structural</b> and growth-related <b>antigens.</b> Our data show that the difference between the therapeutic administration of BCG and RUTI resides mainly in the stronger activation of IFN-γ+ CD 4 + cells and CD 8 + cells against tuberculin purified protein derivative, ESAT- 6, and Ag 85 B that RUTI generates. Both vaccines also triggered a specific immune response against the M. tuberculosis <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> Ag 16 kDa and Ag 38 kDa and a marked mRNA expression of IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 12, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and RANTES in the lung. The results show that RUTI's therapeutic effect is linked not only to the induction of a Th 1 response but also to the stimulation of a quicker and stronger specific immunity against <b>structural</b> and growth-related <b>antigens</b> that reduces both the bacillary load and the pulmonary pathology...|$|R
40|$|A broadly {{cross-reactive}} {{monoclonal antibody}} directed against papillomavirus, coupled to immunoaffinity columns, {{was used to}} isolate bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) and human papillomavirus type 1 (HPV- 1) structural polypeptides from homogenates of productively infected cells. One of the polypeptides i olated from bovine fibropapillomas ppeared to be the BPV- 1 major capsid protein since it had a mol. wt. of 54 K and was reactive by Western blots with papillomavirus genus- and BPV- 1 type-specific rabbit antibodies as well as monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive with BPV- 1 /BPV- 2 and BPV- 1 /deer PV. A polypeptide from human plantar warts similarly {{appeared to be the}} major capsid component since it also had a mass of 54 K to 55 K and reacted with papillomavirus genus- and HPV type-specific rabbit antibodies. By using this technique structural viral polypeptides from papillomavirus-induced lesions containing readily detectable viral <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> but relatively few virus particles, such as seen with mucosotropic HPVs can now be isolated for mapping of virus-specific epitopes...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{quantitative}} radiolabelled antibody procedure to measure the amount of certain virus <b>structural</b> <b>antigens</b> {{on the surface of}} BALB/c RAG cells producing endogenous B-tropic type C virus. RAG cells expressed group specificities of MuLV p 30 on their cell surface but did not express gp 70 group specificities. However, type specificities of gp 70 were expressed on BALB/c cell lines infected with Moloney leukaemia virus. The majority of p 30 antigens detected on the RAG cell surface were removed by trypsin and their reappearance was prevented by cycloheximide, even in the presence of ‘conditioned medium’ containing MuLV. Passive adsorption of exogenous MuLV p 30 to the surface of virus negative BALB/c fibroblasts reached a maximum of 20 % of the protein detectable on virus producing RAG cells. These data support the hypothesis that much, but not all, of the surface p 30 is expressed de novo on the cell membrane and not derived from passive adsorption of p 30 released from shed virus or as a by-product of virus infection of a cell...|$|R
