Graves said Friday, though, that Whyte 2 ̆ 2 prevailed 2 ̆ 2 upon him 2 ̆ 2 that he should relinquish the deanship at the start of this academic year, rather than toward or at the end of it, and I have finally, with great reluctance, accepted his wishes. 2 ̆ 2 Graves said he accepted Whyte 2 ̆ 7 s resignation effective Friday with the approval of the executive committee at a meeting Wednesday. A committee headed by an associate professor of law, Timothy J. Sullivan, has advertised in The New York Times and Chronicle of Higher Education for applicants for the deanship. Graves has asked the committee to prepare a list of three names for consideration by the board of visitors. A college spokesman <b>said</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>that</b> the earliest the board could consider those names would probably be the November meeting. Fischer emphasized Friday that his appointment is merely 2 ̆ 2 interim. 2 ̆ 2 He pointed out that one of the criteria for Whyte 2 ̆ 7 s successor is that he be a person of national prominence in the field of legal education, a requisite that Fischer said would remove him from consideration.
