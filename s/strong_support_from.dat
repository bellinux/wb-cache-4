5|$|At {{a meeting}} of {{regional}} LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Josephine left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels {{at the end of}} February 1875.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a {{campaign}} to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation. <b>Strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Thompson began {{testing the}} waters for higher office. He raised {{campaign}} funds and consulted party leaders {{about the possibility}} of challenging United States House of Representatives then 76-year-old congresswoman Louise Slaughter who was already a 10-term veteran. Slaughter's New York's 28th congressional district was 29 percent African American, and minorities comprised nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote. Charles B. Rangel warned that Slaughter had strong ties to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> labor, women's and pro-choice groups.|$|E

5|$|Minister Jaruzelski became also prime {{minister}} in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the strongest}} bases of anti-Communist {{sentiment}} in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although {{the great majority of}} Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.|$|E

5|$|Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his {{relation}} to King Eric {{seem to have}} emerged in the historical record {{at the same time}} in the mid-1290s with <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its patronus, that is first mentioned only in 1452. Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.|$|E
5|$|With <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee economic department, thereby strengthening {{the authority of}} central government over economic matters. From then on, the government could not be blamed for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened {{the power of the}} government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.|$|E

Nevertheless, encouraged by the <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak.|$|E

On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced that they had cancelled the series, despite preliminary negotiations with the cast for a third season.

5|$|The {{king had}} seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was {{particularly}} tough on that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He {{did not allow}} soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed {{there had to be}} recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), proved more lenient.|$|E
5|$|When the deanship of the {{law school}} came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He {{apparently}} had <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.|$|E

5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E
5|$|Raids resumed soon after, {{in which}} the Cretans were joined by North African and Syrian fleets. The Peloponnese in {{particular}} suffered considerably from their raids, but also Euboea and the Cyclades: the islands of Patmos, Karpathos and nearby Sokastro came under Cretan control, and Cretan rule extended {{as far north as}} Aegina in the Saronic Gulf, and to Elafonisos and Cythera off the southern coast of the Peloponnese; the great Cycladic island of Naxos, probably along with the neighbouring islands of Paros and Ios, was forced to pay them the poll-tax (jizya). As the Muslim presence left generally few material or literary traces, the list of islands at one time controlled or occupied by them could well be longer. Nevertheless, the impact of this new wave of Arab raids was felt across the Aegean, where some islands were deserted altogether, and elsewhere coastal sites were abandoned for better protected inland locations. Athens may have been occupied in c. 896–902, and in 904, a Syrian fleet led by Leo of Tripoli sacked the Byzantine Empire's second city, Thessalonica. The Arabs of Crete co-operated closely with their Syrian counterparts, who often used Crete as a base or a stop-over, as during Leo of Tripoli's fleet return from Thessalonica, when many of the over 20,000 Thessalonian captives were sold or gifted as slaves in Crete. Likewise, the Cretan emirate received <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the Tulunid governors of Egypt (868–905), but their Ikhshidid successors neglected aid to Crete. In 911, another large-scale Byzantine expedition of well over 100 ships was launched against Crete, headed by the admiral Himerios, but it was forced to leave the island after a few months. On its return journey, Himerios' fleet was destroyed in battle off Chios by the Syrian fleet.|$|E

25|$|It is, however, a {{generally}} ill-defined ideology; different, and sometimes contradictory sentiments {{are expressed in}} the name of Peronism. Today, the legacy and thought of Perón have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina, therefore Peronists are usually described as a political movement. Traditionally the Peronist movement has drawn its <b>strongest</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the working class and sympathetic unions, and has been characterized as proletarian in nature.|$|R

5|$|Several phylogenetic studies {{published}} {{during the}} 1990s and 2000s supported {{a close relationship}} between Pseudoryzomys and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, Lundomys and Holochilus. The extinct genera Noronhomys and Carletonomys, described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized {{as members of the}} group. In 2006, a broad morphological and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Within this group, morphological data supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Lundomys to the exclusion of Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys to the exclusion of Lundomys; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received <b>strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> morphological and DNA sequence data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially aquatic, as do Pseudoryzomys and its relatives. Morphological data indicate that the genus Oryzomys is the closest relative of the group that includes Pseudoryzomys, but DNA sequence data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between Oryzomys and the other three genera.|$|E
5|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> fans {{continued}} into the playoffs, as the Penguins sold out their first two home games in 11minutes. The team erected a 12 by 16foot LED screen on the lawn directly outside Mellon Arena, allowing fans to watch all playoff games outside of the stadium, free of charge. A rally scheduled by Allegheny County executive Dan Onorato and Mayor Luke Ravenstahl took place {{in front of the}} Allegheny County Courthouse prior to Game 2 of the team's first-round series on April 11. The Penguins' third game of the playoffs attracted the third-highest regional viewing audience all-time for a Penguins game. The 4,200 tickets offered for the team's first two home games of Round Two sold out within 10minutes. As the playoffs advanced into the later rounds, the team had growing support from players and coaches of other teams in Pittsburgh, including the Steelers and Pirates, and many of the players attended games. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin watched Game 6 of the Finals outside Mellon Arena, along with 3,000 other fans. Prior to the Stanley Cup Final, Mayor Ravenstahl led a rally in the city's Market Square, which featured chanting by the several hundred people in attendance; cooked octopus was also served by 's Fish Market, in reference to the Detroit tradition of throwing octopi onto the ice. The team also opened up Mellon Arena for fans to watch away games on the JumboTron during the Stanley Cup Final; over 13,500 people attended Game 1. Fans who watched the three games played in Detroit raised over $85,000 for the Mario Lemieux Foundation for cancer research. The Penguins also ranked first in the league in merchandise sales.|$|E
