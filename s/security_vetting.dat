After Fuchs was dismissed from his position there as head of the Theoretical Physics Division in 1950, Maurice Pryce acted in the position in a part-time capacity, but when he went to America for a year on sabbatical, Peierls took his place. The position was finally filled permanently Brian Flowers. He resigned from Harwell in 1957 due to what he saw as a lack of openness in [...] <b>security</b> <b>vetting</b> {{at the request of the}} Americans, which he felt indicated a lack of trust in him on the part of senior staff; but he was invited to rejoin in 1960, and did so in 1963, remaining as a consultant for another 30 years.|$|E

50|$|GrantRail Projects {{undertook}} {{major works}} at the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Bicester Modernisation project in Oxfordshire. The project began in late 2007, {{with the aim of}} bringing the east sidings up to modern standards. The 1940s 75 lb flatbottom rail placed on light weight concrete sleepers would be taken out and replaced with 1st generation steel sleepers bedded in ash ballast. The project took place in Bicester MoDs’ Barracks, which operates a non-explosive military storage and distribution hub. This meant that any member of staff that was working on the project had to be <b>security</b> <b>vetted</b> by the MoD before they would be issued the permits to access the site. Members of staff were also subjected to the strict security requirements of working in an operating barracks, however there was the added benefit of being protected by armed guards! The project was completed in 2008.|$|R

50|$|The Cullen Reports, {{the result}} of the inquiry into the massacre, {{recommended}} that the government introduce tighter controls on handgun ownership and consider whether an outright ban on private ownership would be in the public interest in the alternative (though club ownership would be maintained).

The Home Affairs Select Committee agreed with the need for restrictions on gun ownership but stated that a handgun ban was not appropriate.|$|R

50|$|The role he {{inherited}} at the BBC was to liaise with MI5 regarding whether candidates for roles at the broadcasting corporation had suspicious political connections, particularly with communism. However, Stonham's role from his appointment in 1982 was to 'wind down' the vetting {{and reduce the}} number of BBC staff appointments that were subject to vetting. Sir Hugh Greene, a former Director-General of the BBC, said about <b>Security</b> Service <b>vetting</b> of BBC job applicants:I was vetted in 1940. MI5 thought I was a Communist {{but it turned out to}} be a mistake. Michael Grade, at the time Controller of BBC 1, also commented on the existence of Room 105, where Stonham was based:I don't know about room 105, but it does sound like a good title for a drama series.|$|R

5000|$|The {{objective}} of the mission was to cooperate {{in science and technology}} with the U.S., which was neutral and, in many quarters, unwilling to become involved in the war. The U.S. had greater resources for development and production, which Britain desperately wanted to use. The information provided by the British delegation was subject to carefully <b>vetted</b> <b>security</b> procedures, and contained some of the greatest scientific advances made during the war. The shared technology included radar (in particular the greatly improved cavity magnetron which the American historian James Phinney Baxter III later called [...] "the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores"), the design for the VT fuse, details of Frank Whittle's jet engine and the Frisch-Peierls memorandum describing the feasibility of an atomic bomb.

5000|$|Police {{forces will}} recruit PCSOs through adverts placed in {{newspapers}} and on the Internet and by posters in public places. Some may use open days {{as a method of}} attracting applicants. The recruitment of PCSOs has helped some police forces increase the representation of ethnic minorities among their employees. Unlike with police constables, there is no set selection procedure for PCSOs and the process varies between forces. Despite this, section 38 of the Police Reform Act 2002 (the law that made PCSOs) requires that chief constables or Commissioners in charge of police forces have a duty to ensure a recruit [...] "is a suitable person to carry out the functions for the purposes of which they are designated" [...] and is [...] "capable of effectively carrying out those functions". Generally, PCSOs will be selected through a process that involves: an application form; an interview; written, numeracy, and fitness tests; a medical test; and <b>security</b> and background <b>vetting.</b> Welsh PCSOs must have basic abilities to speak the Welsh language. As with a police constable any applicant failing any stage of the recruitment process has to wait six months before applying again.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of Commanders of forward {{intercept}} units were allowed {{to create their own}} cryptanalysts teams.
