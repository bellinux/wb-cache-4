6000|$|MRS. HOPE. Yes, and you'll get {{yourself}} into a mess; I don't approve of it, and when I <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> I don't approve of---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll be our luck not to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> worth shooting," [...] {{declared}} Fred. [...] "I wouldn't give five {{cents for}} our chances of bringing down anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like it," [...] said the chief. [...] "It is neither Waz-don nor Ho-don. I wonder from whence it came {{and what it}} is called." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So far I had not <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{to laugh}} at, but I was deeply interested. 'How came {{all this to}} be known?' I asked. 'Has Miss Temple gone about telling people?' ...|$|R
60|$|Think of that now. I never <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> head as {{that boy}} had. Why, I had eyes and I could see things, {{but they never}} meant nothing to me. But Tom Sawyer was different. When Tom Sawyer <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> it just got up {{on its hind legs}} and TALKED to him--told him {{everything}} it knowed. I never <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> head.|$|R
60|$|Through driving mists I {{seemed to}} <b>see</b> <b>A</b> <b>Thing</b> that smirked and smiled: And {{found that he}} was giving me A lesson in Biography, As if I were a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Come {{around about}} sunset and perhaps you'll <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> or two,' he said, and then {{stuck his head}} under his wing {{as if he were}} nearly dead for want of sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> about Methodists or Presbyterians, {{as far as}} I've gone, and I'm most through Exodus," [...] said Peter suddenly. [...] "When does it {{begin to}} tell about them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Same {{way it does}} in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson {{might be}} drunk, or dreamy or suthin', en he could be mistaken; en two might, maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three <b>sees</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> drunk er sober, it's SO. Dey ain't no gittin' aroun' dat, en you knows it, Mars Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Scuse me,' {{said the}} Elephant's Child most politely, 'but have you <b>seen</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as <b>a</b> Crocodile in these {{promiscuous}} parts?' ...|$|R
60|$|Lov. Faith, madam, out of town, to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little <b>thing</b> that's {{fallen to}} me upon {{the death of}} a grandmother.|$|R
60|$|The senator's son {{followed}} Dave {{into the}} opening the latter had found. All was so dark here they could not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> They stood close together, fearing to take another step.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he demanded, in {{a muffled}} tone, for {{inside of the}} bag {{it was all he}} could do to breathe. The {{covering}} was so heavy he could not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I allow I haven't your imagination, but I can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that's obvious. Father {{thought he}} hid his feelings, but mother knew and grieved. She {{was afraid he}} would give us up {{and go back to}} the North." ...|$|E
30|$|We had {{to stand}} there and stare at this man, hardly more than a boy, buried alive under a hill of rubble, with death barely an inch from his chest, and {{miraculously}} still alive. All we could do was marvel; all of us, we marveled, for {{there was not a}} man amongst us who had <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like that before (Ghosh 2005 a, 241).|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye {{journey from}} far to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little <b>thing.</b> And that man with you," [...] {{pointing}} to Umbopa, [...] "does he also {{come from the}} Stars?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now the fox {{had just}} crept {{up on the}} {{hen-house}} roof; and when he peeped down, there was just light enough to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> white <b>thing</b> bobbing about.|$|R
60|$|As I {{have said}} once before, the {{darkness}} {{in the hold}} was intense, and try my best I could not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> Had there been a light I might not have felt so bad, but as it was I felt next to hopeless.|$|E
60|$|There was no reply, {{but in a}} {{twinkling}} {{his hands}} were caught and bound tightly behind him, and a bag was thrust {{over his head and}} fastened around his throat. The bag was so thick that he could not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> before him.|$|E
6000|$|... 13. Because you <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> difficult, do not {{instantly}} conclude it to {{be impossible}} to master it. Diligence and industry are seldom defeated. Look, therefore, narrowly into the thing itself, and what you observe proper and practicable in another, conclude likewise within your own power.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother of God," [...] the {{wanderer}} said, [...] "I am but {{a common}} king, [...] Nor will I ask what saints may ask, [...] To <b>see</b> <b>a</b> secret <b>thing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hot Rodney {{thinks that}} he <b>sees</b> <b>a</b> pink furry <b>thing</b> moving.|$|R
6000|$|Object. But {{you will}} say, might {{they not be}} deceived? Might not their eyes dazzle, and they might think they did <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> when indeed {{there was no such}} matter? ...|$|R
60|$|It was pitch dark out there. I couldn't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> But I {{knew the}} man could not have gone far, or I should have heard him. I started to sniff round on the chance of picking up his trail. It wasn't long before I struck it.|$|E
60|$|It pleased her also to know, {{that in the}} East {{one must}} use hyperbole, or else remain unheard; because the Eastern man must <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{swelling}} to fill all heaven, or dwindled to a mere nothing, before he is suitably impressed. She immediately sympathized with this Eastern mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{comes of}} imagination," [...] he said. [...] "When you <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> you've {{got to see}} it all around, or what's the good of seeing it at all? I saw the beach, so I left a couple of constables behind {{to keep an eye on}} it. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all, Mr. Shand. And I quite {{understand}} {{that it should be}} difficult for you to understand. When <b>a</b> man <b>sees</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> clearly himself he cannot always realise the fact that others do not see it also. I think I perceive what you have to tell us, and we are very much obliged to you for coming forward so immediately. Perhaps you would not mind sitting in the other room for five minutes while I say a word to Mr. Seely.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{how many}} tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? {{and how many}} brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?" [...] cried Silver, [...] "and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> or two at sea, I have. If you would on'y lay your course, and a p'int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you! I know you. You'll have your mouthful of rum to-morrow, and go hang." ...|$|R
60|$|Mosada. I cannot see! I cannot see! but you Shall <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{to talk on}} when you're old, Under a {{lemon tree}} beside your door; And all the elders sitting in the sun, Will {{wondering}} listen, and this tale shall ease For long, the burthen of their talking griefs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "if that isn't {{one of the}} {{brightest}} ideas I ever heard of! A fire {{in the middle of a}} snow-bank, with a man there a-tendin' to it, an' a chimney! 'T isn't every day that you can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see your}} circles--I don't see them," [...] Hewet continued. [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like a teetotum {{spinning}} in and out--knocking into things--dashing {{from side to}} side--collecting numbers--more and more and more, till the whole place is thick with them. Round and round they go--out there, over the rim--out of sight." ...|$|E
50|$|A person cheats Likho, {{runs away}} (with Likho chasing him), <b>sees</b> <b>a</b> {{valuable}} <b>thing,</b> grabs {{it out of}} greed, the person's hand sticks to it {{and they have to}} cut off their hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{walked along}} the shore for almost quarter of a mile," [...] said Whopper, [...] "but we didn't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> blessed <b>thing</b> that looked like the boat. I am afraid it's gone for good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Sir Henry, [...] "and this {{is where}} he got his ink from," [...] and he pointed to a small wound on the Dom's left arm. [...] "Did ever man <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> before?" ...|$|R
