40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} visual disruption on contrast letter thresholds of the non-affected eye, <b>subjects</b> with one eye enucleated, strabismic <b>subjects</b> using the non-deviating eye and normal control <b>subjects</b> {{were asked to identify}} letters on eye charts and single letter cards which varied in contrast (between 4 and 96 %) and size. At all contrasts, contrast letter acuity of eye enucleated <b>subjects</b> was superior to both normal control <b>subjects</b> and strabismic <b>subjects.</b> Early onset strabismic <b>subjects</b> (onset < 24 months) showed inferior performance to normal control <b>subjects</b> at all contrasts of 25 % and above. Late onset strabismic <b>subjects</b> showed normal performance at all contrasts, except for high contrast single letters, where performance was inferior to normal control <b>subjects.</b> Further, for all <b>subjects</b> groups, performance on letter charts was similar to performance on single letter cards. We conclude that disruption to the visual system caused by eye enucleation or strabismus is not equivalent. These differences may be due to intrinsic differences between the visual systems of eye enucleated <b>subjects</b> and strabismic <b>subjects</b> and/or to the profound differences in deprivation caused by the two conditions.

Caregiver's distress was also assessed. <b>Subjects</b> affected by DLB performed better in long-term memory tests, whereas AD <b>subjects</b> performed better in attentive and executive function tests. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score was significantly higher in DLB <b>subjects</b> than in AD <b>subjects.</b> Furthermore, DLB <b>subjects</b> scored worse than AD <b>subjects</b> in both Activities of Daily Living scale (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL) scales.

40|$|Postmortem {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that morbidly obese <b>subjects,</b> surprisingly, have less coronary atherosclerosis than obese <b>subjects.</b> However, the reasons for this apparent protection from atherosclerosis are not yet clear. Thromboxane A 2, a marker of platelet activation, is greater in obese <b>subjects</b> than in lean <b>subjects,</b> and this might be a clue to their increased cardiovascular risk. However, data on thromboxane A 2 in morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> are lacking; therefore, we hypothesized that lower levels of thromboxane A 2 in morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> might {{play a role in the}}ir lower atherothrombotic burden. We measured the serum levels of thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2), a stable metabolite of thromboxane A 2, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and leptin in 17 lean <b>subjects</b> (body mass index [BMI] 22. 9 +/- 1. 6 kg/m(2)), 25 obese <b>subjects</b> (BMI 32. 6 +/- 2. 4 kg/m(2)), and 23 morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> (BMI 48. 6 +/- 7. 1 kg/m(2)), without insulin resistance, diabetes, or overt cardiovascular disease. The serum TxB 2 levels were lower in the lean <b>subjects</b> than in the obese <b>subjects</b> (p = 0. 046) and in the morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> than in the lean and obese <b>subjects</b> (p = 0. 015 and p < 0. 001, respectively). In contrast; the hs-CRP and leptin levels were greater in the obese than in the lean <b>subjects</b> (hs-CRP, p < 0. 001; leptin, p < 0. 001) and in the morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> than in the lean <b>subjects</b> (p < 0. 001 for both). Leptin was also higher in the morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> than in the obese <b>subjects</b> (p < 0. 001). TxB 2 negatively correlated with leptin and BMI. hs-CRP correlated with leptin, and both also correlated with waist circumference, BMI, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin-resistance. In conclusion, insulin-sensitive morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> had lower levels of TxB 2 than the obese <b>subjects</b> and lean <b>subjects,</b> suggesting that reduced platelet activation could play a role in the paradoxical protection of morbidly obese <b>subjects</b> from atherosclerosis, despite the greater levels of leptin.
