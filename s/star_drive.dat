5|$|From here to Finch Avenue, {{the freeway}} follows the {{boundary}} line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which {{provides access to}} the airport {{as well as the}} southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning <b>Star</b> <b>Drive,</b> and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, {{the group}} {{announced}} that it would build the Gulfton Neighborhood Campus at the intersection of Rookin Street and High <b>Star</b> <b>Drive,</b> once it raises the $20 million ($ in today's money) needed. The Baker-Ripley Neighborhood Center, in Greater Sharpstown, was scheduled to open in December 2009. The center consists of a [...] campus with five buildings. Designed by New Orleans-based Concordia architects and landscaped by Asakura Robinson Company, the site contains a farmers market, health clinic, outdoor film venue, publicly accessible library, school, and some outdoor recreation areas. The center design incorporates architectural influences from Mexican and South American art. Rosa Gomez, an employee of Neighborhood Centers, said that the organization did not want Baker-Ripley to appear [...] "too fancy or official looking" [...] so as not to intimidate recent immigrants. The non-profit organization Project for Public Spaces assisted in the development of Baker-Ripley. The organizers consulted residents of Gulfton and Sharpstown on the design of the center. Susan Baker, the wife of James Baker, a former U.S. Secretary of State, organized a fundraising campaign for the center. The center offers English and computer classes. Neighborhood Centers received a United States Department of Education Promise Neighborhood planning grant, used to fund its Gulfton Promise Project, a program to guide residents from birth until they obtain careers.|$|E
