40|$|Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) {{has grown}} rapidly {{during the past}} decade as part of {{mainstream}} processing method in <b>submicron</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> manufacturing because of its global or near-global planarization ability. However, CMP process is influenced by many factors and is poorly understood. It makes process control and optimization very difficult. This study focuses on the modeling and simulation to facilitate better understanding and better control of the CMP process. The thesis outlines the modeling of CMP process in three scales: particle scale for material removal mechanism, wafer scale for within wafer nonuniformity issues and feature scale for dishing and erosion in metal CMP.;At the particle scale, material removal mechanism is assumed to be due to local plastic deformation of wafer surface at the abrasive - wafer interface. Pad is assumed to deform like a beam to obtain an approximate force partition between abrasives and direct wafer-pad contact. A mechanistic material removal model is derived that delineates the influence of abrasive (shape, size and concentration), pad (rigidity) and process parameters (pressure and relative velocity) on the material removal rate (MRR).;Wafer scale model is based on the solution of indentation of elastic half space by a rigid frictionless polynomial punch. The elastic solution is derived through potential theory and complex analysis method. It is valid for any polynomial punch with integer power or non-integer power. The load-displacement relationship is also derived and the conditions for unbonded or bonded contact are obtained from the boundary condition at punch edge. The corresponding viscoelastic solution is obtained through Laplace transform and elastic-viscoelastic analogy. The elastic solution is used to explain the edge effect. The elastic analytical solution is first verified against numerical results from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation. It shows wafer curvature, indentation depth and load will influence the interface pressure distribution throughout the wafer surface and it introduces parameters control as a potential avenue for completely eliminating the within wafer nonumiformity. Viscoelastic solution is used to explain within wafer nonuniformity, i. e., edge effect and wafer to wafer nonuniformity, i. e., removal rate decay for unconditioned pad. The relationships among wafer-pad interface pressure, wafer shape and wafer loading condition are also investigated.;Feature scale model for dishing and erosion is based on Preston 2 ̆ 7 s relationship for material removal and constant downforce. It shows dishing will reach a limit and is governed by polishing conditions (overpolishing, pressure, velocity), slurry (selectivity), pad character istics (pad stiffness and bending ability), as well as wafer surface feature topography (pattern density, linewidth and pitch). This model is also valid for step height reduction when the same surface material is polished.;Due to process complexity and coupling of various parameters, more fundamental research needs to be carried out and carefully designed experiments need to be done to verify the models.

40|$|In {{the deep}} <b>submicron</b> range of <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design, {{interconnects}} {{and not the}} logical gates are causing the performance bottleneck. The number of available transistors increase {{by a factor of}} 2 every technology node but interconnects do not scale with devices, devices scale down faster and thus the present designs need to be scalable and reusable. Pipeline interconnect free (PIF) logic methodology has a potential to solve these current design problems. In PIF logic methodology the global interconnects are replaced by a chain of logical gates. PIF logic uses only one type of gate which can be connected only to the adjacent eight gates making the gate and the interconnect modeling easier. In order to migrate from one technology node to other, just one PIF cell needs to be redesigned. The PIF cell in new technology node can replace the present cells thus making PIF logic based circuits fully reusable. This thesis implements PIF design methodology to develop two libraries consisting of combinational and sequential functional blocks such as adder, shift registers, multiplexers, decoders and encoders.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of abrupt doping profiles and/or pseudomorphic Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x layers in mainstream CMOS device fabrication has exciting prospects {{for future generations}} of deep <b>submicron</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> In this work, issues concerning the use of surfactant mediated solid source molecular beam epitaxy for producing such structures has been studied. Two potential surfactants have been considered, atomic hydrogen and antimony. The use of atomic hydrogen for the suppression of Ge segregation during solid source MBE {{was the subject of}} a limited study. It is evident that significant reductions in the Ge segregation occur at a growth temperature of 500 deg C although this occurs at the expense of a severe degradation in material quality. As the growth temperature is increased, the ability of hydrogen to suppress Ge segregation falls rapidly due to hydrogen desorption from the Si(100) surface. The narrow temperature window in which atomic H surfactant is effective is compared to gas source MBE and CVD growth where growth commences under a partial hydrogen coverage. It is suggested that current limitations of the atomic H surfactant technique are associated with the use of higher growth rates during solid source MBE. For the case of hydrogen surfactant in the control of dopant segregation, it was found that the use of atomic hydrogen surfactant causes an anomalous boron diffusion during growth. Hydrogen also causes a desorption of the boron surface phase reducing the uptake efficiency. Investigations with antimony have shown that the use of atomic hydrogen surfactant reduces the segregation ratio by two orders of magnitude but the doped layers become highly defective after #approx# 260 nm of growth. A detailed systematic study of the benefits of surfactant mediated growth was impeded by contaminating species determined to originate from the discharge type atomic hydrogen source used in the present study. The use of a PBN discharge cell in the source was found to give rise to B contamination. A mechanism is proposed involving the erosion of the PBN cell and the formation of B_ 2 H_ 6. The use of a quartz discharge cell was found to give rise to oxygen contamination which increases from #approx# 4 x 10 " 1 " 8 cm"-" 3 to over 1 x 10 " 2 " 0 cm"-" 3 during approximately 50 hours of use. Atomic hydrogen sources of the type used in the present study are judged unacceptable for surfactant studies. For the case of antimony surfactant mediated growth, the most important consideration is incorporation from the adlayer. The incorporation is measured as a function of growth temperature, and more importantly the adlayer coverage which has previously only been measured in the kinetically limited segregation regime. The surfactant behaviour of Sb is studied through the reduction of strain-induced roughening of a pseudomorphic Si_ 1 _-_xGe_x layer.
