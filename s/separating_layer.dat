50|$|Both {{structurally}} and functionally, it {{is possible}} to distinguish a back or dorsal side from a belly or ventral side in Trichoplax adhaerens. Both consist of a single layer of cells coated on the outside with slime and are reminiscent of epithelial tissue, primarily due to the junctions—belt desmosomes—between the cells. In contrast to true epithelium, however, the cell layers of the Placozoa possess no basal lamina, which refers to a thin layer of extracellular material underlying epithelium that stiffens it and separates it from the body's interior. The absence of this structure, which is otherwise to be found in all animals except the sponges, can be explained in terms of function: a rigid <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> would make the amoeboid changes in the shape of Trichoplax adhaerens impossible.

40|$|Abstract Background Infiltration of {{colorectal}} carcinomas (CRC) with T-cells {{has been}} associated with good prognosis. There are some indications that chemokines could be involved in T-cell infiltration of tumors. Selective modulation of chemokine activity at the tumor site could attract immune cells resulting in tumor growth inhibition. In mouse tumor model systems, gene therapy with chemokines or administration of antibody (Ab) -chemokine fusion proteins have provided potent immune mediated tumor rejection which was mediated by infiltrating T cells at the tumor site. To develop such immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer patients, one must identify chemokines and their receptors involved in T-cell migration toward tumor cells. Methods To identify chemokine and chemokine receptors involved in T-cell migration toward CRC cells, we have used our previously published three-dimensional organotypic CRC culture system. Organotypic culture was initiated with a layer of fetal fibroblast cells mixed with collagen matrix in a 24 well tissue culture plate. A layer of CRC cells was placed on top of the fibroblast-collagen layer which was followed by a <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> of fibroblasts in collagen matrix. Anti-CRC specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mixed with fibroblasts in collagen matrix were placed on top of the <b>separating</b> <b>layer.</b> Excess chemokine ligand (CCL) or Abs to chemokine or chemokine receptor (CCR) were used in migration inhibition assays to identify the chemokine and the receptor involved in CTL migration. Results Inclusion of excess CCL 2 in T-cell layer or Ab to CCL 2 in <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> of collagen fibroblasts blocked the migration of CTLs toward tumor cells and in turn significantly inhibited tumor cell apoptosis. Also, Ab to CCR 2 in the <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> of collagen and fibroblasts blocked the migration of CTLs toward tumor cells and subsequently inhibited tumor cell apoptosis. Expression of CCR 2 in four additional CRC patients' lymphocytes isolated from infiltrating tumor tissues suggests their role in migration in other CRC patients. Conclusions Our data suggest that CCL 2 secreted by tumor cells and CCR 2 receptors on CTLs are involved in migration of CTLs towards tumor. Gene therapy of tumor cells with CCL 2 or CCL 2 /anti-tumor Ab fusion proteins may attract CTLs that potentially could inhibit tumor growth. </p...|$|E

40|$|A resistance-in-series {{model is}} used to {{describe}} the pervaporation performance of elastomeric membranes in the removal of volatile organic components from water. Equations have been derived to describe the organic component flux as a function of feed concentration, permeability of the organic component in the membrane, membrane thickness and liquid boundary layer mass transfer coefficient. The model has been verified using both homogeneous and composite membranes of polydimethylsiloxane, ethylene propylene rubber and polyoctenamer. Membranes {{with a wide range of}} thicknesses have been prepared and the pervaporation behaviour for the removal of toluene and trichloroethylene from aqueous solutions has been studied. The experiments show that the hydrodynamic boundary layer resistance is of great importance. For highly permeable polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane mass transfer in the boundary layer is rate determining and should be considered carefully in further development of the process. For less permeable polymers such as ethylene propylene rubber this effect becomes more dominant with decreasing membrane thickness. The water fluxes are inversely proportional to the thickness of the actual <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> and they depend strongly on the type of elastomer used. A proper choice of the elastomeric material and the thickness of the <b>separating</b> <b>layer</b> will determine the selectivity of the process...|$|E
