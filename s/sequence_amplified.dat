5000|$|Transposon {{sequencing}} {{begins by}} transforming bacterial populations with transposable elements using bacteriophages. Tn-seq uses the Himar I Mariner transposon, a common and stable transposon. After transformation, the DNA is cleaved and the inserted <b>sequence</b> <b>amplified</b> through PCR. The recognition sites for MmeI, a type IIS restriction endonuclease, can be introduced {{by a single}} nucleotide change in the terminal repeats of Mariner. It is located 4 bp {{before the end of}} the terminal repeat. MmeI makes a 2 bp staggered cut 20 bases downstream of the recognition site. When MmeI digests DNA from a library of transposon insertion mutants, fragmented DNA including the left and right transposon and 16 bp of surrounding genomic DNA is produced. The 16 bp fragment is enough to determine the location of the transposon insertion in the bacterial genome. The ligation of the adaptor is facilitated by the 2 base overhang. A primer specific to the adaptor and a primer specific to the transponson are used to amplify the sequence via PCR. The 120 bp product is then isolated using agarose gel or PAGE purification. Massively parallel sequencing is then used to determine the sequences of the flanking 16 bp. Gene function is inferred after looking at the effects of the insertion on gene function under certain conditions.|$|E

A total of 202 serum samples from individuals exposed and not exposed to poultry was tested by nested-PCR for a target sequence located in the MDV gD gene. The assay system was specific and sensitive, making it possible to detect a single copy of the target sequence. Forty-one (20 %) of the 202 serum samples tested positive for MDV DNA.

40|$|International audienceIn {{temperate}} forest soils, filamentous ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi affiliated to the Agaricomycetes and Pezizomycotina contribute to key biological processes. The diversity of soil fungal communities is usually estimated by studying molecular markers such as nuclear ribosomal gene regions amplified from soil-extracted DNA. However, this approach only reveals {{the presence of}} the corresponding genomic DNA in the soil sample and may not reflect the diversity of the metabolically active species. To circumvent this problem, we investigated the performance of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX 1) -encoding gene as a fungal molecular marker for environmental RNA-based studies. We designed PCR primers to specifically amplify Agaricomycetes and Pezizomycotina COX 1 partial <b>sequences</b> and <b>amplified</b> them from both soil DNA and reverse-transcribed soil RNA. As a control, we also amplified the nuclear internal transcribed spacer ribosomal region from soil DNA.

40|$|International audienceHerpetosoma is a {{homogenous}} subgenus {{of several}} dozen named {{species that are}} often described as morphologically indistinguishable T. lewisi-like parasites. These trypanosomes normally infect rodents and utilize fleas as vectors. Although this trypanosome subgenus is considered nonpathogenic to normal hosts, {{some of them are}} on rare occasion reported in association with human disease. Recently, a T. lewisi-like infection was detected in a sick Thai infant, thus the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of T. lewisi infections among different rodents indigenous to Thailand in order to identify possible sources of human cases. Blood was collected from a total of 276 rodents trapped from urban and rural areas of three Thai provinces between 2006 and 2007. These samples were processed for DNA isolation and tested with a PCR assay universal for the genus Trypanosoma, followed by internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS- 1) sequence analysis to identify infections in positive samples. Herpetosoma known as T. lewisi-like trypanosomes were present among Rattus (14. 3 %) and Bandicota (18. 0 %) rodent species and salivarian trypanosomes closely related to T. evansi were detected in Leopoldamys (20 %) and Rattus (2. 0 %) species. Herpetosoma were prevalent among rodents associated with both human and sylvatic habitats, while three of the four salivaria-positive rodents were from a forest biotope. A Herpetosoma ITS- 1 <b>sequence</b> <b>amplified</b> from one of these samples was 97. 9 % identical to that reported for T. lewisi in an experimentally infected rat and 96. 4 % identical to the <b>sequence</b> <b>amplified</b> from blood from a Thai infant. Habitats where rodents were collected significantly affect rodent infection, at least for T. lewisi, suggesting that the degree of anthropization may influence the transmission of Trypanosoma spp. These results suggest that multiple Herpetosoma species or strains are enzootic to Thailand, and that Rattus and Bandicota species are possible sources of human exposure to these parasites...|$|E

An HIV-infected man developed a rapidly-enlarging abdominal mass, suggestive of a neoplasm, that subsequently invaded his liver and caused death.
