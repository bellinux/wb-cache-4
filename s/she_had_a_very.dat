5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did {{know how to handle}} guns, because she had been raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

500|$|Jelena Balšić ( [...] ; 1365/1366– 1443), {{also known}} as Jelena Lazarević, was a medieval Serbian noblewoman, {{daughter}} of Lazar of Serbia. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong personality and significantly influenced the way her husbands, first Đurađ II Balšić and second Sandalj Hranić, and her son Balša III governed their realms. Jelena encouraged them to resist Venetian encroachment on territory belonging to Zeta, the medieval Serbian state ruled by Đurađ II and then by Balša III after Đurađ II's death. She is {{also known as}} a writer in epistolary literature, particularly her correspondence with Nikon of Jerusalem, a monk in the Gorica monastery on Lake Skadar (Montenegro). Her three epistles are part of the Gorički zbornik (Cyrillic: Горички зборник), a medieval manuscript collection.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Nick Offerman improvised the line [...] "Put it in an e-mail?", which he said when Leslie told him <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long story to tell him. Schur thought the line was [...] "my {{favorite}} thing in the show", and they made him say in it every subsequent take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. Look at those bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} 20th century singers of South African popular music was Miriam Makeba, who played a key-role, in the 60s, in drawing global audience's attention to African music and its meaning. [...] Zenzile Miriam Makeba was said to have been one {{of the most}} influential and popular musicians of Africa, beginning in the 1950s. She was a part of three bands, including one all-woman band and two others. [...] She performed all types of jazz music, traditional African music, and music that was popular in western Africa at the time. [...] Miriam played a majority of her music in the form of [...] "mbube", which was [...] "a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music." [...] After she moved to the U.S., problems with Makeba's passport occurred and she had to stay in America, it was said that she put an American twist on most of her African music. [...] <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> diverse scale of her vocal range and could hit almost any note. [...] "The Empress of African Music" [...] passed away at the age of 76.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} Hollyoaks entrance, a {{reporter}} for The Sun stated that Lynsey would be [...] "a hit with the boys", while putting other girls' noses out of joint. During {{an interview with a}} reporter from the show's official website, Hassan explained that Lynsey had been best friends with Cheryl for a long time. When Lynsey joined Cheryl in the village, she quickly found herself a job at the local hospital and fell in love. Hassan described Lynsey as being [...] "a very loyal person", who wanted to see the best in people and would do anything for her family and friends. Hassan tried to make her character's personality similar to her own, so she would be believable to the viewers. Hassan felt that on occasion Lynsey needed to stand up for herself, agreeing with the reporter who called her [...] "a bit of a push-over." [...] She later said that Lynsey should speak her true opinions more and stop being [...] "a soft touch". A new side to the character started to emerge when she began to grow a backbone and Hassan opined that Lynsey could [...] "hold her own". The actress commented to an OK! journalist that Lynsey was the typical girl next door, who could stand [...] "on her own two feet" [...] and speak what was on her mind. Hassan also thought that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long fuse, but if it reached the end then you would see the spark in her.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{problems}} at Stiff resolved, The Pogues were finally able to enter a recording studio again in early 1987 to start work on their third album, now with Steve Lillywhite producing. A new demo of [...] "Fairytale of New York" [...] was recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios in March 1987, with MacGowan singing both {{the male and female}} roles. However, {{it was not until the}} third set of recording sessions in August 1987 in nearby RAK Studios that it was suggested that Lillywhite take the track back to his home studio and let his wife Kirsty MacColl lay down a new guide vocal for the song. Having worked on her vocals meticulously, Lillywhite brought the recording back to the studio where the Pogues were impressed with MacColl's singing and realised she would be the ideal voice for the female character in the song. MacGowan later said, [...] "Kirsty knew exactly the right measure of viciousness and femininity and romance to put into it and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong character and it came across in a big way... In operas, if you have a double aria, it's what the woman does that really matters. The man lies, the woman tells the truth." [...] MacGowan re-recorded his vocals alongside the tape of MacColl's contribution (the duo never recorded the song together in the studio) and the song was duly completed with the addition of a harp played by Siobhan Sheahan and a horns and string section. The French horns and strings were recorded at Townhouse Studios on the last day of recording If I Should Fall from Grace with God, arranged by Fiachra Trench after Fearnley had mocked up an arrangement on a keyboard.|$|E
