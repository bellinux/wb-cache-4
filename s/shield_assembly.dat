50|$|A typical hot-cathode {{thyratron}} uses {{a heated}} filament cathode, completely contained within a <b>shield</b> <b>assembly</b> with a control grid on one open side, which faces the plate-shaped anode. In the off situation the voltage {{on the control}} grid is negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. When positive voltage is applied to the anode, no current flows. When the control electrode is made less negative, electrons from the cathode can travel to the anode because the positive attraction from the anode prevails over the negative repulsion caused by the slightly negative voltage on the control grid. The electrons will ionize the gas by collisions with the gas in the tube, and an avalanche effect results, causing an arc discharge between cathode and anode. The shield prevents ionized current paths that might form within other parts of the tube. The gas in a thyratron is typically {{at a fraction of the}} pressure of air at sea level; 15 to 30 millibars (1.5 to 3 kPa) is typical. For a cold-cathode thyratron the trigger voltage on the control grid will typically be positive, and a flash-over from control grid to cathode will initiate the arc discharge in the tube.|$|E

The goal {{of the program was}} to demonstrate and confirm that solar dynamic power systems are viable for future space applications such as the International Space Station (ISS). The major components of the system include a solar receiver, a closed Brayton cycle power conversion unit, a power conditioning and control unit, a solar concentrator, a radiator, a thermal control system, and a Space Shuttle carrier. Unfortunately, the mission was demanifested from the ISS Phase 1 Space Shuttle Program in 1996.

The algorithm was successfully applied in software and progress was made in hardware implementation. Special equipment and interpolation techniques were also developed to deal with M 3 R unique system design and calibration requirements.

A way to overcome this problem and to improve the fuel economy is to introduce the use of radial enrichment distribution in the fuel assembly. This master thesis shows, through a case study of three fuel cycles at Ringhals 4,  that the internal peaking factor can be improved by roughly 2 – 3 % and that the maximum enthalpy raise hot channel factor can be improved by about 2. 0 – 2. 5 % if the fuel assemblies contain three different levels of enrichments instead of currently one.

40|$|The cryoEDM neutron {{electric}} dipole moment experiment requires a SQUID magnetometry system with pick-up loops inside a magnetically shielded volume connected to SQUID sensors by long (up to 2 m) twisted-wire pairs (TWPs). These wires run outside the main shield, and therefore must run through superconducting capillaries to screen unwanted magnetic pick-up. We show that the average measured transverse magnetic pick-up {{of a set of}} lengths of TWPs is equivalent to a loop area of 5. 0 × 10 - 6 m 2 /m, or 14 twists per metre. From this we set the requirement that the magnetic shielding factor of the superconducting capillaries used in the cryoEDM system must be greater than 8. 0 × 104. The shielding factor - the ratio of the signal picked-up by an unshielded TWP to that induced in a shielded TWP - was measured for a selection of superconducting capillaries made from solder wire. We conclude the transverse shielding factor of a uniform capillary is greater than 107. The measured pick-up was equal to, or less than that due to direct coupling to the SQUID sensor (measured without any TWP attached). We show that discontinuities in the capillaries substantially impair the magnetic shielding, yet if suitably repaired, this can be restored to the shielding factor of an unbroken capillary.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a unique method for protecting inductive proximity (IP) sensors from extreme thermal exposure. The method presented in this study employs a barrier of ceramic tile material developed for the space shuttle program. While it may be intuitive that the ceramic tile material will provide adequate protection for extreme temperatures, what is not clear is the adaptability of this material to commercial use in a steel mill environment. One of the potential problems associated with using any thermal barrier is a partial or complete attenuation of the magnetic field generated by the sensor. To effectively utilize the shielding material in an application such as this it is necessary to understand the effect of the ceramic material on the magnetic field generated by the proximity sensor. In order to test the effectiveness of the ceramic tile to provide the level of thermal protection required and to discover if the tile will allow adequate magnetic field penetration for sensor detection, a series of two separate tests will be run. The first test will verify that the thermal shielding properties maintain the cool side temperature within the operational threshold of the sensor; the second test will establish the maximum sensing distance with the ceramic tile interposed between the sensor and the detectable object.

Additional analyses in this revision include partial fuel basket loadings, loading 26. 1 inch Mark IA fuel assemblies into Mark IV fuel baskets, and the revised fuel and scrap basket designs. The MCO MCNP model was revised to include the <b>shield</b> plug <b>assembly...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} making RF <b>shielded</b> cable {{connector}} <b>assemblies</b> {{and the resulting}} structures is described. The process basically consists of potting wires of a shielded cable between the cable shield and a connector housing to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable. The formed potting is coated with an electrically conductive material so as to form an entirely encompassing adhering conductive path between the cable shield and the metallic connector housing. A protective jacket is thereby formed over the conductive coating between the cable shield and the connector housing...|$|R
