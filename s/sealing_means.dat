Stable-nitrogen-isotope analysis of muscle revealed that harbor seals were enriched over sea lions (mean δ 15 N = l 8. 6 % vs. 17. 5 %) which were in turn enriched over northern fur <b>seals</b> (<b>mean</b> 6 i 5 N = 16. 6 % 0). Trophic segregation among these species likely results primarily from differential reliance on herring (Clupea harengus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and large us, small walleye pollock (Theregra chalcogramma). According to their δ 15 N values, adult male Steller sea lions showed a higher trophic position than adult females (mean δ 15 N: 18. 0 % vs. 17. 2 %), whereas adult female northern fur seals were trophically higher than juvenile male fur <b>seals</b> (<b>mean</b> VSN: 16. 5 % 0 vs. 15. 0 %). Each of these observed differences likely resulted from differential reliance on squid or differences in the size range of pollock consumed. Three northern fur seal pups showed higher δ 15 N enrichment over adults (mean 17. 7 % vs. 15. 8 %) due to their reliance on their mother’s milk.

Variations in catch per unit effort were explored in relation to year, sea ice conditions, day of the year, and geographic location. In most years, the harvest was predominantly represented by ringed <b>seals</b> (<b>mean</b> = 0. 43, range 0. 25 - 0. 67), followed by ribbon (mean = 0. 31, range 0. 15 - 0. 43), spotted (mean = 0. 19, range 0. 11 - 0. 35) and bearded <b>seals</b> (<b>mean</b> = 0. 07, range 0. 03 - 0. 14). The struck-and-lost percentages were as high as 30 - 35 % for ringed, bearded and spotted seals and 15 - 20 % for ribbon seals. Catch per unit effort (number of seals/skiff*day) for ringed, ribbon, and spotted seals had a similar seasonal pattern with a distinct spike in catches for spotted seals {{in the first week}} of May, for ribbon seals in the last week of May, and for ringed seals in the second week of June. Catches of bearded seals showed a less pronounced temporal structure with a gradual increase toward the end of the harvest season in the majority of years. Spatial distribution of harvest effort followed closely with seal distribution obtained from aerial surveys. These data could be used as a source of information on seal herd location throughout the breeding and molting seasons and for more complex demographic or life-table models. We did not find any evidence of the decline of catch per unit effort over the study period.

The two parts together form the primary mechanical seal. They can be rigidly tied by their support, {{but most of the time}} they allow one of more liberty degrees. These ties represent one or more secondary mechanical seals and also elastic elements. The optimization of a mechanical face <b>seal</b> <b>means</b> the satisfaction of two antagonistic conditions. One is trying to reduce to the minimum the leakages, even to make them vanish and also trying to limit the friction and the wear. The second one presumes that a lubrication normal operation of the HS, HD, THD, EHD and/or M surfaces is ensured. This paper takes into consideration just the hydrostatic lubrication from the primary mechanical seal, along with the purpose to place at projectors disposal different relations for the functional parameters (the opening axial force, the loss debit) ...|$|R
