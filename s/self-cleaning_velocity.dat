40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{procedure}} is {{proposed for the}} optimal design of urban drainage networks. The approach employed {{is based on the}} utilization of a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA), which represents, at the same time, a modification, a generalization and an extension of a procedure already adopted in the past for the optimal design of water distribution networks. The approach is firstly tested by comparing the results obtained by writers and by other researches for a specific urban drainage network taken from the literature. Then, a second case of study is considered, taken from the literature too, in order to evaluate, by sligtly different versions of the procedure proposed: i) potential advantages which could be obtained considering the possibility to allow to the network ending node elevation to be not fixed “a priori” but variabile, in a predetermined range of values, up to the value recognized as maximim by the “a priori” reasoning; ii) the need to respect the technical constraint for which the sizes of channels/conduits downstream a node should be not lower than the corrisponding sizes of all the channel/conduits upstream the node itself; and iii) the opportunity, in several case of practical interest, to relax one or more constraints of the problem, such that connected to reaching of the <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>velocity</b> during the peak wastewater flow period...|$|E
40|$|Pre-project geoecological {{studies were}} carried out in autumn 2015 along {{the entire length of the}} Tikhomandritsa river, in Navolok lake waters near the river source and Udomlya lake near its mouth, as well as on the {{territory}} adjacent to the river, as part of the Comprehensive Engineering Surveys. The aim of the studies was to obtain initial data to assess the current ambient conditions of the study area, as well as to develop the project of cleaning the upper stretch of the Tikhomandritsa riverbed and spillway structure construction. Water, bottom sediments and soil contamination levels were identified. It is found that the water quality in the studied water bodies belongs to the contaminated category. Bottom sediments at the upper stretch of the river up to a distance of 2. 5 km from its source are pure and can be used in agriculture without restrictions. Bottom sediments samples taken at a distance of 5. 5 km from the river source and its mouth contain dangerous level of coliform bacteria. Basing on the territory survey a tree and shurberry felling plan was drawn up and the volume of works of the river purification was determined. The project implementation will help to increase the river flow in dry water years, increase its <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>velocity</b> and environmental improvement of the area. In addition, the increase of water flow into Udomlya lake will provide Kalinin NPP with additional water resources for its process water supply. The conceptual scheme of this study is largely applicable for the basins of other small rivers...|$|E
40|$|Treball fi de carreraThe {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} methodology to characterize from the hydrodynamic point of view in a circular tank using a acoustic velocimeter techniques techniques, as well the design and construction of a structure for the correct hold of the probe. An experimental design was out, which consists of the creation of a structure that allowed precise displacements of the probe. Different configurations were made in which different volumes, inlet diameters and heights of water were used. Data acquisition consisted in the measurements in a series of points of the tank. From the program of the probe, called HorizonADV, the data acquisition was made later data were filtered by an specific program called WinADV. Calculations were made using a spreadsheet to find the resist tank coefficient. The comparison of the obtained results has indicated that there are in the different points a the tank. With these velocities, has been found the integrated velocity of the tank and its respective resist tank coefficient. Tank coefficients, were very similar. This gives to understand, that resist tank coefficient was stable and that it can be very useful in order to obtain the desired <b>velocities</b> <b>self-cleaning,</b> within a safe range for fish of velocities...|$|R
