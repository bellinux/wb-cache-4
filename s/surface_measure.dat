40|$|It {{has been}} shown in Refs. 2 – 6 that two natural {{definitions}} of surface measures, on the space of continuous paths in a compact Riemannian manifold embedded into Rn, introduced in the paper by Smolyanov 1 are equivalent; this means that there exists a natural object — the <b>surface</b> <b>measure,</b> which we call the Smolyanov <b>surface</b> <b>measure.</b> Moreover, it {{has been shown}} 2 – 6 that this <b>surface</b> <b>measure</b> is equivalent to the Wiener measure and the corresponding density has been found. But the known proof of the equivalence of the two definitions of the <b>surface</b> <b>measure</b> is rather nonexplicit; in fact the densities of the measures corresponding to the two different definitions were found independently and only a posteriori it was discovered that those densities coincided. Our aim is to give a direct proof of this fact. We introduce a more restrictive definition of the <b>surface</b> <b>measure</b> as the weak limit of a standard Brownian motion in Rn conditioned to be in the tubular ε-neighborhood of the manifold at times 0 = t 0 < t 1 < · · · < tn− 1 < tn = 1 as both ε and the diameter of the partition tend to zero. Letting ε and then the diameter of the partition tend to zero and vice versa, we arrive at the two definitions above. We prove the existence of the Smolyanov <b>surface</b> <b>measure</b> using our definition, show that this measure is equivalent to the law of a Brownian motion on the manifold, and compute the corresponding density in terms of the curvature of the manifold.
