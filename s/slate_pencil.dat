25|$|Some {{species of}} sea urchins, {{such as the}} <b>slate</b> <b>pencil</b> urchin (Eucidaris tribuloides), are {{commonly}} sold in aquarium stores. Some species are effective at controlling hair algae, and they make good additions to an invertebrate tank.|$|E

6000|$|... "There!" [...] cried Sylvia, {{laying down}} her <b>slate</b> <b>pencil,</b> and indulging in another {{tremendous}} yawn; [...] "we can't {{do a thing}} more till Mary comes! What can she be about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This will help," [...] he said, {{bringing}} forth a soapstone <b>slate</b> <b>pencil,</b> {{which he}} cracked into tiny lengths. [...] "The candy that lasts!" [...] he cried softly, as {{he dropped the}} bits into the box.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{two were}} come to a small shop, {{in the windows of}} which were {{displayed}} a variety of wares, from <b>slate</b> <b>pencils</b> to mint drops, and here Seth halted irresolutely.|$|R
50|$|The compact {{variety of}} {{pyrophyllite}} {{is used for}} <b>slate</b> <b>pencils</b> and tailors chalk (French chalk), and is carved by the Chinese into small images and ornaments of various kinds. Other soft compact minerals (steatite and pinite) used for these Chinese carvings are included with pyrophyllite under the terms agalmatolite and pagodite.|$|R
60|$|I {{made up my}} mind {{right away}} what to do. I'd save old Mack if I could. To have a good, seasoned, ineligible man like that turn chicken for a girl that hadn't quit eating <b>slate</b> <b>pencils</b> and {{buttoning}} in the back was more than I could look on with easiness.|$|R
60|$|They {{leaped to}} the ground and soon saw that Sam's {{conjecture}} was correct. A sharp stone had cut into one of the front shoes, making a hole about as large in diameter as a <b>slate</b> <b>pencil.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{principal}} {{currency of}} Our School was <b>slate</b> <b>pencil.</b> It had some inexplicable value, {{that was never}} ascertained, never reduced to a standard. To have a great hoard of it was somehow to be rich. We used to bestow it in charity, and confer it as a precious boon upon our chosen friends. When the holidays were coming, contributions were solicited for certain boys whose relatives were in India, and who were appealed for under the generic name of 'Holiday-stoppers,' - appropriate marks of remembrance that should enliven and cheer them in their homeless state. Personally, we always contributed these tokens of sympathy {{in the form of}} <b>slate</b> <b>pencil,</b> and always felt {{that it would be a}} comfort and a treasure to them.|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose that}} I looked snubbed and mortified, for {{she went on}} in her grave, grown-up way: [...] "Why are you angry because God made me taller than you? {{especially}} as I am whole months older, for {{my father told me}} so. Come, let us write our names against these marks, so that {{in a year or two}} you may see how you outgrow me." [...] Then with the <b>slate</b> <b>pencil</b> she scratched [...] "Marie" [...] against her mark very deeply, so that it might last, she said; after which I wrote [...] "Allan" [...] against mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me look at}} that box!" [...] {{cried the}} lady of the house. She {{commenced}} to make an inspection, holding the box close to a lamp. [...] "Humph! Rubber bands, beans, <b>slate</b> <b>pencils,</b> and polishing wax!" [...] she declared. [...] "Mr. Tubbs, do you call this a box of candy?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hester Dethridge {{advanced}} {{slowly to}} the table at which Lady Lundie was sitting. A <b>slate</b> and <b>pencil</b> hung at her side, which she used for making such replies as {{were not to be}} expressed by a gesture or by a motion of the head. She took up the <b>slate</b> and <b>pencil,</b> and waited with stony submission for her mistress to begin.|$|R
60|$|Summer was one {{continuous}} and busy play-spell {{for her in}} those days before her lessons became a serious thing, for as she sat in school she was experimenting in the same way. She chewed paper into balls and snapped them like the boys. She carried slips of elm bark to chew also, and <b>slate</b> <b>pencils</b> she crunched daily. She gnawed {{the corners of her}} slate, tasted her ink and munched the cedar of her pencil.|$|R
6000|$|The {{men came}} in with a rush, and took seats {{wherever}} they could find them, and their attack on the boiled potatoes and chicken should have been appalling to the women, but it was not. They enjoyed seeing them eat. Ed Green was prodigious. One cut at a big potato, followed by two stabbing motions, and it was gone.--Two bites laid a leg of chicken as bare as a <b>slate</b> <b>pencil.</b> To us standing in the corner waiting our turn, it seemed that every [...] "smitch" [...] of the dinner was in danger, for the others were not far behind Ed and Dan.|$|E
6000|$|It was Xmas Eve on the Old Homestead. Reader, do you know, by sight, the Old Homestead? In the pauses of {{your work}} at your city desk, where you have grown rich and avaricious, does it never rise before your mind's eye, the quiet old {{homestead}} that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away from it? The Old Homestead that stands beside the road just on {{the rise of the}} hill, with its dark spruce trees wrapped in snow, the snug barns and the straw stacks behind it; while from its windows there streams a shaft of light from a coal-oil lamp, about as thick as a <b>slate</b> <b>pencil</b> that you can see four miles away, {{from the other side of}} the cedar swamp in the hollow. Don't talk to me of your modern searchlights and your incandescent arcs, beside that gleam of light from the coal-oil lamp in the farmhouse window. It will shine clear to the heart across thirty years of distance. Do you not turn, I say, sometimes, reader, from the roar and hustle of the city with its ill-gotten wealth and its godless creed of mammon, to think of the quiet homestead under the brow of the hill? You don't! Well, you skunk! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girls were}} not the only {{scholars}} who [...] "appreciated" [...] her. When Anne went to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by Mr. Phillips to sit with the model Minnie Andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious [...] "strawberry apple." [...] Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew was in the old Blythe orchard {{on the other side of}} the Lake of Shining Waters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy Andrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one of his perquisites. Charlie Sloane's <b>slate</b> <b>pencil,</b> gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met with a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in after school to rewrite it.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{rocks at}} or near the surface within County Durham are Ordovician age (485 - 443 Ma) Skiddaw Group rocks found in a small inlier near Cronkley Fell in upper Teesdale. They are {{recorded}} as the Skiddaw Slates, better known from the Lake District 50 km to the west. A small quarry in these phyllites was worked at one time to make <b>slate</b> <b>pencils.</b> Overlying these are pyroclastic rocks thought to belong to the Borrowdale Volcanic Group.|$|R
50|$|The porch {{was added}} in the late 15th-16th century and is notable for the grooves in the {{left-hand}} doorjamb, created by pupils sharpening their <b>slate</b> <b>pencils</b> before class and possibly by the sharpening of arrow heads prior to the weekly after-church archery practice which became compulsory after the disaster of the Battle of Flodden. The 12th-century Norman entrance into the nave has a door made from a single board of cedar wood from the nearby Dawyck estate.|$|R
5000|$|Underwater writing <b>slates</b> and <b>pencils</b> {{are used}} to {{transport}} pre-dive plans underwater, to record facts whilst underwater and to aid communication with other divers.|$|R
60|$|Eccentric in {{everything}} else, Mat was consistently eccentric {{even in his}} confusion. Some men who are bashful in a young lady's presence show it by blushing--Mat's color sank instead of rising. Other men, similarly affected, betray their burdensome modesty by fidgeting incessantly.--Mat was as still as a statue. His eyes wandered heavily and vacantly over the girl, beginning with her soft brown hair, then resting {{for a moment on}} her face, then descending to the gay pink ribbon on her breast, and to her crisp black silk apron with its smart lace pockets--then dropping at last to her neat little shoes, and to the thin bright line of white stocking that just separated them from the hem of her favorite grey dress. He only looked up again, when she touched his hand and put her <b>slate</b> <b>pencil</b> into it. At that signal he raised his eyes once more, read the line she had written to thank him for the scarlet pouch, and tried to write something in return. But his hand shook, and his thoughts seemed to fail him, he gave her back the slate and pencil, looking her full in the eyes as he did so. A curious change came over his face at the same time--a change like that which had altered him so remarkably in the hosier's shop at Dibbledean.|$|E
6000|$|I mean (in {{response}} to what you write me of your having read the Golden B.) to try to produce some uncanny form of thing, in fiction, that will gratify you, as Brother--but let me say, dear William, that I shall greatly be humiliated if you do like it, and thereby lump it, in your affection, with things, of the current age, that I have heard you express admiration for and that I would sooner descend to a dishonoured grave than have written. Still I will write you your book, on that two-and-two-make-four system on which all the awful truck that surrounds us is produced, and then descend to my dishonoured grave--taking up {{the art of the}} <b>slate</b> <b>pencil</b> instead of, longer, the art of the brush (vide my lecture on Balzac.) But it is, seriously, too late at night, and I am too tired, for me to express myself on this question--beyond saying that I'm always sorry when I hear of your reading anything of mine, and always hope you won't--you seem to me so constitutionally unable to [...] "enjoy" [...] it, and so condemned to look at it from a point of view remotely alien to mine in writing it, and to the conditions out of which, as mine, it has inevitably sprung--so that all the intentions that have been its main reason for being (with me) appear never to have reached you at all--and you appear even to assume that the life, the elements forming its subject-matter, deviate from felicity in not having an impossible analogy with the life of Cambridge. I see nowhere about me done or dreamed of the things that alone for me constitute the interest of the doing of the novel--and yet it is in a sacrifice of them on their very own ground that the thing you suggest to me evidently consists. It shows how far apart and to what different ends we have had to work out (very naturally and properly!) our respective intellectual lives. And yet I can read you with rapture--having three weeks ago spent three or four days with Manton Marble at Brighton and found in his hands ever so many of your recent papers and discourses, which, having margin of mornings in my room, through both breakfasting and lunching there (by the habit of the house,) I found time to read several of--with the effect of asking you, earnestly, to address me some of those that I so often, in Irving St., saw you address to others who were not your brother. I had no time to read them there. Philosophically, in short, I am [...] "with" [...] you, almost completely, and you ought to take account of this and get me over altogether.--There are two books by the way (one fictive) that I permit you to raffoler about as much as you like, for I have been doing so myself--H. G. Wells's Utopia and his Kipps. The Utopia seems to me even more remarkable for other things than for his characteristic cheek, and Kipps is quite magnificent. Read them both if you haven't--certainly read Kipps.--There's also another subject I'm too full of not to mention the good thing I've done for myself--that is, for Lamb House and my garden--by moving the greenhouse away from the high old wall near the house (into the back garden, setting it up better--against the street wall) and thereby throwing the liberated space into the front garden to its immense apparent extension and beautification....|$|E

50|$|The {{ground floor}} of a two-storey {{building}} on the main shopping street of the town is divided into a shop, now a gift shop and the entrance for visitors, and the printer's office. This has a connecting door to the shop {{as well as its}} own door to the street which leads to a counter for serving customers. A large desk at the office window has the clutter typical of the early twentieth century, drawers contain stationery including writing <b>slates,</b> <b>pencils,</b> sealing wax, pen nibs and bottles of ink. Wall shelves store job dockets, invoices, wages books and ledgers dating back {{to the start of the}} business. Framed photographs show how little the office has changed since 1900, and a certificate shows the authority to issue tickets for steamships to America.|$|R
60|$|Upon this desk, {{at one end}} of it, the end, namely, {{at which}} Bella was to sit, Mary Erskine had placed a small thin board which she found in the shop, and by the side of it a piece of chalk. This small board and piece of chalk were to be used instead of a <b>slate</b> and <b>pencil.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of slaves practicing {{how to read and}} write in secrecy. There have been identified slates discovered near George Washington’s estate in Mount Vernon with writings carved in them. Bly noted that on the slave sites owned by Thomas Jefferson there have been “237 unidentified <b>slates,</b> 27 <b>pencil</b> leads, 2 <b>pencil</b> <b>slates,</b> and 18 writing slates were uncovered in houses once occupied by Jefferson's black bond servants.” That shows that slaves were secretly practicing their reading and writing skills when they had time alone, most likely at night. They also believe slaves practiced their letters in the dirt because it was much easier to hide than writing on slates. Slaves then passed on their newly learned skills to others.|$|R
