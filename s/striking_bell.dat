2500|$|As of 2010, the {{original}} 1836 turret clock mechanism by John Moore Junior (later John Moore & Sons) {{was on display}} at Herne Bay Museum and Gallery, having been replaced in 1971. The mechanism is sometimes erroneously attributed to Peter Morton of Herne Bay and John Greenwood of Canterbury because their names are engraved on the front, however they were the suppliers and could not have manufactured such a large mechanism. This mechanism is listed in John Moore's 1877 catalogue as: [...] "Herne Bay, Kent. Four 5ft dials, the gift of Mrs Thwaites (sic)." [...] It was installed in the tower on a trestle and encased in a deal box, with doors {{for access to the}} winding mechanism. It had extra brass wheels for the <b>striking</b> <b>bell,</b> and was held in an iron frame. The clock had to be wound twice a week, the clock weights providing the stored energy. The pendulum was about [...] long, giving a slow beat of nearly two seconds. The clock winder had to ascend 66 steps, then turn the heavy strike winder 75 times, and the time winder 20 times, using a crank. The bell, made of bell metal, was supplied by Thomas Mears II in 1837, weighs 12 cwt and measures [...] high and [...] diameter. The bell is still functioning in the Tower.|$|E

50|$|The house {{gets its}} name from the <b>striking</b> <b>bell</b> tower. Whenever a fire broke out in the village, the bells of Bell House and the Dulwich College chapel were rung in order to gather help in pumping up water for the village fire engine. Thomas Wright lived at Bell House until his death on 7 April 1798. In 1833, the house was {{extended}} to provide servants' quarters. Further extensions were made in the 1870s and Sir Edwin Lutyens was engaged to carry out certain alterations in 1918.|$|E

50|$|The parish {{church at}} Little Paxton is {{dedicated}} to St. James and is a Grade II* listed building that consists of a chancel, nave, south aisle, west tower and a north porch. The church was {{not mentioned in the}} Domesday Book, but there is evidence that there was a stone church on the site {{by the end of the}} 12th century. The west tower was built c.1400 and the south aisle c.1500. The west tower had just four bells but these had not been rung since 1899 when it was decided that they needed re-hanging. A refurbishment project in 2010-11, which had some National Lottery funding, saw the original bells restored, the acquisition of two-second hand bells, and a new bell cast. The church now has a clock <b>striking</b> <b>bell</b> and a peal of six bells; the new bells were rung for the first time in November 2011. The church of St. James, Little Paxton, is in the deanery of St Neots in the diocese of Ely.|$|E

40|$|Ongnu (Jade Clepsydra; {{also called}} Heumgyeonggaknu) is a water clock {{was made by}} Jang Yeong-sil in 1438. It {{is not only an}} {{automatic}} water clock that makes the sound at every hour on the hour by <b>striking</b> <b>bell,</b> drum and gong, but also an astronomical clock that shows the sun's movement over time. Ongnu‘s power mechanism used is a water-hammering method applied to automatic time-signal device. The appearance of Ongnu is modeled by Gasan (pasted-paper imitation mountain) and Binpungdo (landscape of farming work scene) is drawn {{at the foot of the}} mountain. The structure of Ongnu is divided into the top of the mountain, the foot of the mountain and the flatland. There located are sunmovement device, Ongnyeo (jade female immortal; I) and Four gods (shaped of animal-like immortals) at the top of the mountain, Sasin (jack hour) and Musa (warrior) at the foot of the mountain, and Twelve gods, Ongnyeo (II) and Gwanin on the flatland. In this study, we clearly and systematically understood the time-announcing mechanism of each puppet. Also, we showed the working mechanism of the sun-movement device. Finally, we completely established the 3 D model of Ongnu based on this study...|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{automatic}} musical devices {{can be traced}} back many centuries, and the use of pinned barrels to operate percussion mechanisms (such as <b>striking</b> <b>bells</b> in a clock) was perfected long before the invention of the piano.

Later automatons usually perform on the hour, half-hour or quarter-hour, usually to <b>strike</b> <b>bells.</b> Common figures in older clocks include Death (as a reference to human mortality), Old Father Time, saints and angels. In the Regency and Victorian eras, common figures also included royalty, famous composers or industrialists.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the 19th century {{efforts were}} made to {{automate}} the signalling process. Trinity House eventually developed a system (the [...] "Signal, Fog, Mk I") for firing a gun-cotton charge electrically. However, the charge had to be manually replaced after each signal. At Portland Bill, for example, which had a five-minute interval between fog-signals, this meant the horns had to be lowered, the two new charges inserted, and the horns raised again every five minutes during foggy periods.Clockwork systems were also developed for <b>striking</b> <b>bells.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1981, Rhoads was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} sculpture entitled 42nd Street Ballroom for the New York/New Jersey Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City, which ushered {{in a period of}} production for larger, monumental ball machine sculptures. In these large machines, chain-driven lifters carry balls {{to the top of the}} sculpture. Then, using only gravity, the balls travel down several different tracks that loop, twist, and spiral. The balls trigger motion, hit objects, <b>strike</b> <b>bells,</b> gongs, chimes, drums and even xylophone bars, allowing each machine to create its own music. Once the ball reaches the bottom of the sculpture, it is lifted to the top and the process continues.|$|R
