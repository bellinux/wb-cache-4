500|$|Oliver Lyttleton of indieWire {{felt that}} viral ads {{such as the}} webbed menace website <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> forced and cribbed heavily from the example set by The Dark Knight with viral games. Silas Lesnick of SuperheroHype!, on the other hand, {{described}} the film's viral as [...] "one of the most comprehensive film virals to date".|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "It's just {{not all that}} satisfying. After endless weeks of stick-beating and the events of last week, it all <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too tidy," [...] and {{additionally}} called Arya's story [...] "anticlimactic." [...] However, Egner also praised the episode's continuation with the King's Landing story, {{as well as the}} follow up with Sandor Clegane and the Brotherhood Without Banners. TV Guides Damian Holbrook criticized as implausible the fact that Arya, after being stabbed multiple times in the previous episode by the Waif, was able to outrun and kill her faster, stronger nemesis in this episode. Hanh Nguyen of Indiewire also felt the Riverrun sequence ended in an anticlimactic fashion as well.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, critic Richard Keller {{generally}} praised the installment, calling it [...] "the funniest {{episode of the}} series so far". Keller compared James Roday to Ben Stiller, and praised the development of Gus' character. He also praised the development of detectives Lassiter and O'Hara. He cited the scene in which Shawn and Gus are trapped by the criminals {{as an example of}} why the episode was the funniest to him. However, Keller also had a few complaints with the installment. He criticized the episode's beginning, where [...] "a seemingly large evergreen forest looming" [...] can be seen, saying that it ruined the illusion of the show taking place in Santa Barbara. He stated that [...] "the whole thing <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit incomplete" [...] {{due to the lack of}} a complete [...] "psychic reveal" [...] at the end of the episode, and that the reduced use of Corbin Bernsen in the installment was an issue.|$|E

500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different than the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one {{who is going to}} stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode." [...] She also praised Helms for [...] "prov once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} mixed. Ramsey Isler of IGN noted his enjoyment of Dan Quagmire's character traits: [...] "I'll give the writing team credit for this little plot twist, as I'm sure we were all expecting the elder Quagmire {{to be even more}} of a womanizer than his son." [...] Regarding the episode's treatment of LGBT issues, Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated, [...] "there's a gold mine of material to dig into for satire and comedy; comedy which will likely offend as many people as the real issues do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the scenes between Quagmire and his father [...] "surprisingly well-done" [...] while noting, [...] "the scenes where the mockery <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too mean-spirited were definitely out of the show's worst sections of its toolkit". Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number ten on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and praised Brian's line of 'Hey... I fucked your dad' after Quagmire attacks him, describing it as [...] "amazing".|$|E
500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E

500|$|Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu {{commented that}} [...] "though {{the first half}} of the movie is well-paced, the second half sags with the songs and twists forced into the plot to buy time", but stated that it was [...] "passable with its slick production, a few funny lines, glam {{quotient}} and star appeal." [...] Subhash K. Jha criticised the film's [...] "dishy digressions" [...] and [...] "peripheral sub-plots", rating it 2 out of 5 overall, but was impressed with the court scene, which he considered [...] "splendid". He also found Chopra's performance to be a triumph, remarking: [...] "A star is born! As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can go to any length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene like never before." [...] Jha believed that Kareena was miscast and <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward in a non-glamorous role, but [...] "comes into her own in the climactic courtroom sequence", a sentiment echoed by Jitesh Pillai in his review for The Times of India. Pillai gave a rating of 3 out of 5 and noted that [...] "it isn't drama that directors were striving for, yet the film works." ...|$|E
500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rough around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment is that he did not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to O'Malley was well received; Staci Krause of IGN wrote: [...] "Their {{relationship has been}} a roller coaster and {{it was nice to}} see this turn of events, as she really is a perfect contrast to George." [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Hahn, Williams was largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. The character was also listed in Wetpaint's [...] "10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV".|$|E

500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] had a {{share of}} good reviews, with critics acclaiming the {{character}} development and emotional struggles of Michael. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found this [...] "middle chapter" [...] to be [...] "quite good" [...] with [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle {{to deal with the}} guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to [...] "Gay Tom" [...] as [...] "a unique and funny twist". Cynthia Littleton of Variety wrote that [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man {{trying to do the right}} thing, most of the time." [...] In a four-out-of-five-star review, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones lauded the lack of interruption to the flashback and commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Dan Compora of SyFy Portal enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization of the rest of the main cast. In an overall positive review for the episode, The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships."

[...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking.

2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there was nothing I could do with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E
