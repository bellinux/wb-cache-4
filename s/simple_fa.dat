40|$|We study {{diversity}} in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels. We consider a channel model where the transmitter simultaneously releases {{a large number}} of information particles, while the information is encoded in the time of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of arrival of the information particles. The random propagation is characterized by the general class of right-sided unimodal densities. We characterize the asymptotic exponential decrease rate of the probability of error {{as a function of the}} number of released particles, and denote this quantity as the system diversity gain. Four types of detectors are considered: the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, a detector that is based on the first arrival (FA) among all the transmitted particles, and a detector based on the last arrival (LA). When the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a large interval, we show that the <b>simple</b> <b>FA</b> detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector. On the other hand, when the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a small interval, we show that the simple LA detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector.

40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO) and linseed oil (LO) (12 % crude fat content each) in African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) diets were tested on the fillet flesh quality, {{chemical}} and fatty acid (FA) composition, after 3 and 6 weeks of feeding. The bodyweight gain {{of fish and}} the fillet dry matter, crude protein and crude fat content was not different among the divergent treatments. High (> 20 %) total n 3 FA supplementation significantly increased the moisture loss of fillet (FO, LO). Applying the <b>simple</b> <b>FA</b> dilution model (JOBLING 2004 a, 2004 b), the incorporation dynamics of the most largely dosed FAs were accurately predictable after 3 weeks (R² between observed and estimated data for total n 3 FAs: FO 0. 95, LO 0. 73 and for α-linolenic acid, LO 0. 97). In the fillet FA composition the metabolism of n 3 acids was more pronounced. The large provision of α-linolenic acid (LO) had a pronounced effect on the longchain, polyunsaturated n 3 FA proportions (eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids), while no effect was experienced on docosahexaenoic acid. This study suggests that daily bodyweight gain is not, while fillet flesh quality and FA composition is slightly compromised when fish oil is substituted for vegetable oils...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of the infinitesimal {{deformations}} of all real, simple, finite-dimensional Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, considered as a class of n-Leibniz algebras characterized by having an n-bracket skewsymmetric in its n- 1 first arguments. We prove that all n> 3 simple finite-dimensional Filippov algebras are rigid as n-Leibniz algebras of this class. This rigidity also holds for the Leibniz deformations of the semisimple n= 2 Filippov (i. e., Lie) algebras. The n= 3 <b>simple</b> <b>FAs,</b> however, admit a non-trivial one-parameter infinitesimal 3 -Leibniz algebra deformation. We also show that the n≥ 3 simple Filippov algebras do not admit non-trivial central extensions as n-Leibniz algebras of the above class. Comment: 19 pages, 30 refs., no figures. Some text rearrangements for better clarity, misprints corrected. To appear in J. Math. Phy...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the basic properties of two n-ary algebras, the Generalized Lie Algebras (GLAs) and, particularly, the Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras (FAs), {{and comment on}} their n-ary Poisson counterparts, the Generalized Poisson (GP) and Nambu-Poisson (N-P) structures. We {{describe the}} Filippov algebra cohomology relevant for the central extensions and infinitesimal deformations of FAs. It is seen that semisimple FAs do not admit central extensions and, moreover, that they are rigid. This extends the familiar Whitehead's lemma to all n≥ 2 FAs, n= 2 being the standard Lie algebra case. When the n-bracket of the FAs is no longer required to be fully skewsymmetric one is led to the n-Leibniz (or Loday's) algebra structure. Using that FAs are a particular case of n-Leibniz algebras, those with an anticommutative n-bracket, we study the class of n-Leibniz deformations of <b>simple</b> <b>FAs</b> that retain the skewsymmetry for the first n- 1 entires of the n-Leibniz bracket.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of strings {{by means of a}} distribution function f(A, B, x, t) defined on a 9 + 1 D phase space, where A and B are the correlation vectors of right- and left-moving waves. We derive a transport equation (an analogous to Boltzmann transport equation for particles) that governs the evolution of long strings with Nambu-Goto dynamics as well as reconnections taken into account. We also derive a system of coupled transport equations (an analogous to BBGKY hierarchy for particles) which can simultaneously describe long strings f̃(A, B, x, t) as well as <b>simple</b> loops <b>f(A,</b> B, x, t) made out of four correlation vectors. The formalism can be used to study non-linear dynamics of fundamental strings, D-brane strings or field theory strings. For example, the complicated semi-scaling behavior of cosmic strings translates into a simple solution of the transport system at small energy densities.

40|$|Our online {{interaction}} with information-systems may well provide the largest arena of formal logical reasoning {{in the world}} today. Presented here is {{a critique of the}} foundations of Logic, in which the metaphysical assumptions of such 'closed world' reasoning are contrasted with those of traditional logic. Closed worlds mostly employ a syntactic alternative to formal language namely, recording data in files. Whilst this may be unfamiliar as logical syntax, it is argued here that propositions are expressed by data stored in files which are essentially non-linguistic and so cannot be expressed by <b>simple</b> formulae <b>F(a),</b> with the inference-rules normally used in Logic. Hence, the syntax of data may be said to define a fundamentally new kind of logical form for simple propositions. In this way, the logic of closed systems is shown to be non-classical, differing from traditional logic in its truth-conditions, inferences and metaphysics. This paper will be concerned mainly with how the reference and certain inferences in such a closed system differ metaphysically from classical logic...|$|R
30|$|The {{distributed}} {{algorithm is}} executed {{by a set}} of interconnected <b>simple</b> Finite Automata (<b>FA)</b> deployed into a mesh Γ of cells, modeling the smart shopping mall. Let S be the set of cells that are shops in Γ and let P be all products sold in the shopping mall. Each cell c has eight neighbors N(c) = {c_N, c_NE, c_E, c_SE, c_S, c_SW, c_W, c_NW} and, at each time transition, it can communicate with them by exchanging messages. In a pre-processing phase of the algorithm, the central authority establishes the set of products AP={p_ 1,...,p_n}⊆P that are recommended (available) to the shoppers (anyway during the execution of the algorithm this set may vary, because some products can be bought). Let n denote the number of available products and AP_c ⊆AP be the set of products available in the shop c ∈S.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTunisian {{population}} {{is characterized by}} its heterogeneous ethnic background and high rate of consanguinity. In consequence, there {{is an increase in}} the frequency of recessive genetic disorders including Fanconi anemia (FA). The aim {{of this study was to}} confirm the existence of a founder haplotype among FA Tunisian patients and to identify the associated mutation in order to develop a <b>simple</b> tool for <b>FA</b> diagnosis. Seventy-four unrelated families with a total of 95 FA patients were investigated. All available family members were genotyped with four microsatellite markers flanking FANCA gene. Haplotype analysis and homozygosity mapping assigned 83 patients belonging to 62 families to the FA-A group. A common haplotype was shared by 42 patients from 26 families at a homozygous state while five patients from five families were heterozygous. Among them, 85 % were from southern Tunisia suggesting a founder effect. Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique, we have also demonstrated that this haplotype is associated with a total deletion of exon 15 in FANCA gene. Identification of a founder mutation allowed genetic counseling in relatives of these families, better bone marrow graft donor selection and prenatal diagnosis. This mutation should be investigated in priority for patients originating from North Africa and Middle East...|$|R
