Suvorov and his Austrian chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles planned to evict the weakened and battered French forces from Genoa and the Italian Riviera. However, instructions soon arrived from Vienna <b>squelching</b> any notion of offensive operations. Emperor Francis and his foreign minister Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula, Baron of Thugut insisted that the Italian fortresses must first be captured. In fact the emperor and Thugut were suspicious of Russian designs on Genoa and Tuscany, areas which they considered to be in Austria's sphere of influence. For his part, Suvorov was annoyed with Viennese officials for trying to direct the war from long distance.|$|E
25|$|Tolstoy's actions became {{instrumental}} {{in the life of}} the Seventh. Stalin read Pravda closely and he generally trusted Tolstoy's comments. He remained highly suspicious of spontaneous outpourings of mass enthusiasm both before and after the war, seeing them as veiled instances of oppositionist feelings. However, he also realized <b>squelching</b> such mass expressions in wartime could be unwise, and he had Tolstoy's comments to give them credence in the case of the Seventh Symphony. Tolstoy's interpretation of the Seventh, in fact, lined up with Stalin's stated support of nationalism and patriotism. At least as important was that without the help of the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union would not overcome Nazi Germany. The Soviets had been seen not long ago in the Western press as godless villains and barbarians. Now the Americans and British had to believe that the Soviet Union was helping protect the values those countries cherished from fascism for the Soviets to continue receiving those countries' support.|$|E

The multiple flower representations signified the biological life cycle, as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. [...] "One had flowers {{coming out of this}} black ooze," [...] said Fincher, [...] "it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers." [...] Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took [...] "a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots".

40|$|Objectives:To {{investigate}} whether a <b>squelch</b> effect {{occurs in the}} first 3 years after simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation and to {{investigate whether}} this effect increases during follow-up. Study Design:Prospective study {{as part of a}} multicenter randomized controlled trial that compares simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation to sequential and unilateral cochlear implantation. Setting:Tertiary referral center. Patients:Nineteen postlingually deafened adults. Intervention:Simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation. Main Outcome Measure:The <b>squelch</b> effect, measured yearly with a speech-intelligibility-in-noise test with spatially separated sources. Bilateral results were compared to unilateral results in which the cochlear implant at the noise side was turned off. The <b>squelch</b> effect was investigated for the patients' best performing ear and for the left and right ears separately. Results:In 13 individual patients, a <b>squelch</b> effect was present after 1 year. This number increased during follow-up years. On group level, a <b>squelch</b> effect was present in patients' best performing ear after 2 and 3 years (1. 9 dB). A <b>squelch</b> effect was present in both ears after 3 years (AS: 1. 7 dB, AD: 1. 3 dB). Conclusion:Patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation developed a measurable benefit from the <b>squelch</b> effect after 2 years in their best performing ear and after 3 years in both ears. These observations suggest that the brain learns to use interaural differences to segregate sound from noise after simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation. The <b>squelch</b> effect increased over time which suggests a growth in cortical integration and differentiation of inputs from bilateral CIs due to brain plasticity.

[...] In addition, Random Access Memories is ranked #497 on NMEs list, [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork echoed this sentiment, calling the record [...] "a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast {{and even a few}} pinches of their <b>squelching</b> stadium-dance aesthetic". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that [...] "though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect." [...] Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. DJ Magazine {{commented on the}} shift in Daft Punk's musical style: [...] "While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making." [...] Resident Advisor stated that [...] "it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic." [...] In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record [...] "taps into the wonder and excitement" [...] of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, [...] "Random Access Memories is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20/20 Experience is a neo soul album partly {{inspired}} by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The songs have average lengths of seven minutes and are characterized by vamps, abrupt key changes, and unexpected rhythms and harmonies. Music journalist Jody Rosen observed an emphasis on [...] "rhythm and flow" [...] rather than catchiness, and {{said that it is}} [...] "not quite a pop album", as its [...] "sense of musical space-time is more elastic and sprawling than anything on the radio".

50|$|In telecommunications, <b>squelch</b> is {{a circuit}} {{function}} that acts {{to suppress the}} audio (or video) output of a receiver {{in the absence of}} a sufficiently strong desired input signal. <b>Squelch</b> is widely used in two-way radios and radio scanners to suppress the sound of channel noise when the radio is not receiving a transmission. <b>Squelch</b> can be 'opened', which allows all signals entering the receiver to be heard. This can be useful when trying to hear distant, or otherwise weak signals (also known as DXing).|$|R
50|$|<b>Squelch</b> {{was invented}} first {{and is still}} in wide use in two-way/three-way radio, {{especially}} in the amateur radio world. <b>Squelch</b> of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal, {{which is used to}} keep commercial and amateur radio repeaters from transmitting continually. Since a carrier <b>squelch</b> receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal (noise, etc.), CTCSS is often used as well, as it avoids false keyups. Use of CTCSS is especially helpful on congested frequencies or on frequency bands prone to skip and during band openings.|$|R

An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a <b>squelching</b> effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard– which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled [...] "Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone." [...] One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking ("So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!"). Secombe noted that [...] "Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each– chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens– all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects." [...] An FX instruction in one script read [...] "Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do".
