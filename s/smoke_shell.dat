The 58th Division ascribed their success to excellent training, a good creeping barrage and <b>smoke</b> <b>shell,</b> which had thickened the mist and blinded the German defenders; gas shell barrages on the German reinforcement routes had depressed German morale. On 26 September, the 58th Division advanced further up the ridge.|$|E

2500|$|A barrage drill was devised, {{to prevent}} the {{opponent}} from manning his parapets and installing machine-guns, in time to meet the assault.

2500|$|After six hours, the {{aircraft}} were to range further east to attack troop concentrations. Aircraft from the Corps and Army wings were to attack all targets found west of Staden–Dadizeele, with the Ninth Wing taking over {{east of the}} line. German aerodromes were attacked periodically and special [...] "ground patrols" [...] were mounted below [...] over the front line, to defend the Corps artillery-observation machines. Attempts to co-ordinate air and ground attacks had mixed results; on the II Corps front, few air attacks were co-ordinated with the infantry and only a vague report was received from an aircraft about a German counter-attack, which was further obscured by a smoke-screen. On the XIX Corps front, despite [...] "ideal" [...] visibility, no warning by aircraft was given of a German counter-attack over the Zonnebeke–St Julien spur at [...] which was also screened by <b>smoke</b> <b>shell.</b> To the north on the XVIII and XIV Corps fronts, the air effort had more effect, with German strong-points and infantry being attacked on and behind the front.

The British brigades could not communicate with their artillery due to the rain and because the Germans also used <b>smoke</b> <b>shell</b> in their creeping barrage. The German counter-attack was able to drive the British back from the green line along the Zonnebek–Langemarck road, pushing XIX Corps back to the black line. The Germans also recaptured St Julien just west of the green line on the XVIII Corps front, where the counter-attack was stopped by mud, artillery and machine-gun fire.

The 58th Division objective was [...] ahead, among German strong points on {{the west end of}} Gravenstafel spur. As a frontal attack here had failed, the division feinted with its right brigade, while the left brigade made the real attack from the flank. The feint captured Winnipeg crossroads, as the main attack by three battalions one behind the other, captured Vancouver Farm, Keerselaere and Hubner Farm. The two following battalions passed through the leading battalion and turned right halfway up the spur, to reach Wurst Farm on a tactically vital part of the spur, {{at the same time as}} the barrage.

Artillery for the attack came from the 20th and 38th divisional artilleries and the heavy guns of XIV Corps. A creeping barrage was to move at [...] in four minutes and a standing barrage was to fall on the objective lines in succession, as the infantry advanced. The first objective was to be bombarded for twenty minutes, as the creeping barrage moved towards it, then the second objective was to be shelled for an hour to catch retreating German soldiers, destroy defences and force any remaining Germans under cover. A third barrage was to come from the XIV Corps heavy artillery, sweeping back and forth with high explosive, from [...] ahead of the foremost British troops, to stop German machine-gunners in retired positions from firing through the British barrage. <b>Smoke</b> <b>shell</b> was to be fired, to hide the attacking troops, as they re-organised at each objective. A machine-gun barrage from [...] was arranged, with half of the guns moving forward with the infantry, to add to their firepower. German troops were also to be strafed by British aircraft from low altitude. The French First Army was to extend the attack north, from the Kortebeek to Drie Grachten, aiming to reach the St Jansbeck.|$|E

Twenty minutes before zero hour, torrential rain began and high winds sprang up. Each man carried three smoke candles to form a smoke screen but they were soaked by the rain; the ground was covered in {{waterlogged}} shell-holes and became much muddier, causing to the infantry to lag behind the creeping barrage. In the XIX Corps attack, the 15th (Scottish) Division attacked with [...] who were forced back after reaching Gallipoli.

The 48th (South Midland) Division was to advance [...] with the 143rd Brigade on the right flank and the 144th Brigade on the left. The first objective of the 143rd Brigade was the trench from Winnipeg and Springfield and the second objective the south end of the Wilhemstellung.
