5|$|Thorpe {{arrived for}} the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona {{for his first}} major {{international}} competition since Menzies' appointment under heavy media scrutiny following his non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On {{the first night of}} competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400m freestyle in a time 2.5s outside his world record, making him the first to win three world titles in the same event. After his relatively slow 400m, he was again under pressure in the 200m freestyle after van den Hoogenband led at the 100m mark ahead of world record pace. Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title, and gained some relief after his <b>sprint</b> <b>training</b> yielded his first medal in the 100m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77s. In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost. He ended his individual campaign on a promising note with his experiment with the 200m individual medley, setting a new personal best of 1min 59.66s to claim silver. Thorpe again anchored the 4×200m freestyle team to retain the world title along with Hackett, Nicholas Sprenger and Craig Stevens, with a reduced margin over the Americans, who finished less than two seconds in arrears. Michael Klim's injuries left the relay teams weakened, with Thorpe anchoring the 4×100m freestyle team to fourth, At the end of a difficult year in the water, his standing had fallen in the eyes of Swimming World, who rated him fourth in the world. He was again named as Australian Swimmer of the Year, jointly with Hackett.|$|E

50|$|Poiseuille’s Law for flow {{indicates}} that the total flow in a tube {{is related to the}} diameter of the tube by a power of four. Thus, an increase in the diameter of a high order blood vessel such as an arteriole vastly increases the total flow that a given vessel network can withstand. This flow increase is vitally important in the microvasculature remodeling following exercise, especially in <b>sprint</b> <b>training.</b> <b>Sprint</b> <b>training</b> is a type of anaerobic exercise that relies on having the maximum amount of blood available to the vessel network at any given time (Prior et al., 2004).|$|E

50|$|While {{genetics}} play a {{large role}} in one's ability to sprint, athletes must be dedicated to their training to ensure that they can optimize their performances. <b>Sprint</b> <b>training</b> includes various running workouts, targeting acceleration, speed development, speed endurance, special endurance, and tempo endurance. Additionally, athletes perform intense strength training workouts, as well as plyometric or jumping workouts. Collectively, these training methods produce qualities which allow athletes to be stronger, more powerful, in hopes of ultimately running faster.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} the effect of <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> on metabolic and physical fitness in {{adolescents and young adults}} with intellectual disabilities when compared with continuous aerobic training and no training (control). Methods: Fifty-four persons with intellectual disabilities (age: 17 (3. 0), body mass index: 27. 7 (3. 7), intelligence quotient: 59 (8. 6)) were matched based on age, gender and intelligence quotient between <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> (n = 17), continuous aerobic training (n = 15) and control (n = 14). <b>Sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes at ventilatory threshold (blocks 1 and 3 : 10 sprint bouts of 15 seconds, followed by 45 seconds relative rest; block 2 : continuous training) twice a week for 15 weeks. Continuous aerobic training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes continuous training. After eight weeks, intensity was increased to 110 % of ventilatory threshold. The control group did not participate in supervised exercise training. Before and after the training period, body composition, physical and metabolic fitness were evaluated. Results: <b>Sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> showed a significant positive evolution for waist circumference, fat%, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, peak VO 2, peak Watt, ventilatory threshold, 6 -minute walk distance and muscle fatigue resistance when compared with no training (P < 0. 01). The <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> group demonstrated significant improvements for fat%, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, fasting insulin, peak VO 2 and peak power and ventilatory threshold (P < 0. 01) when compared with continuous aerobic training.

50|$|Traditional free-weight {{training}} {{is often used}} by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises {{can be used to}} train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Without proper strength and flexibility, throwers can become extremely injury prone, especially in the shoulder and elbow. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and <b>sprint</b> <b>training</b> are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 113 km/h (70 mph).|$|E

New Findings What is the central question of this study? Does the combination of <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> with postexercise blood-flow restriction enhance maximal aerobic physiology and performance in trained individuals? What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate the potency of combining blood-flow restriction with <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> in increasing maximal oxygen uptake in trained individuals; however, this did not translate to an enhanced exercise performance. We also show that blood-flow restriction combined with <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> enhanced postexercise hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α mRNA expression, suggesting the possibility for greater hypoxia-mediated adaptations, such as enhanced capillary growth, with this intervention. This investigation assessed the efficacy of <b>sprint</b> interval <b>training</b> (SIT) combined with postexercise blood-flow restriction as a novel approach to enhance maximal aerobic physiology and performance. In study 1, a between-groups design was used to determine whether 4 weeks (2 days per week) of SIT (repeated 30 s maximal sprint cycling) combined with postexercise blood-flow restriction (BFR) enhanced maximal oxygen uptake (inline image) and 15 km cycling time-trial performance (15 km TT) compared with SIT alone (CON) in trained individuals.

40|$|A laboratory-based sprint {{running test}} has been devised {{to examine the}} {{performance}} characteristics and metabolic responses of an individual to 30 seconds of maximal exercise. A non-motorised treadmill was used so that the individual was able to sprint at his own chosen speed and also to vary his speed as fatigue occurred. The treadmill was instrumented so that the chosen speeds {{as well as the}} equivalent distance travelled could be monitored by micro-computer throughout the test. The test-retest reliability of the procedure was investigated with 14 recreational runners who performed the test on different days. A good correlation (r = 0. 93) was found between the values obtained for peak running speeds on the two occasions. In an attempt to establish whether or not this test could be used to identify the differences in the performance characteristics of highly trained individuals, the responses to the test of eleven <b>sprint</b> <b>trained</b> and eleven endurance trained athletes were examined. The <b>sprint</b> <b>trained</b> athletes covered a greater distance (162. 2 +/- 5. 95 m vis 153. 51 +/- 12. 32 m; p less than 0. 01) and had higher blood lactate concentrations (16. 52 +/- 1. 23 mM vis 12. 98 +/- 1. 77 mM; p less than 0. 01) than the endurance trained athletes.
