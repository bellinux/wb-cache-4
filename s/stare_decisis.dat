25|$|Justice Antonin Scalia reiterated {{his view}} that {{substantive}} reasonableness review was {{incompatible with the}} Sixth Amendment, but concurred out of concerns for <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling is}} so poorly decided, some {{scholars}} conclude, {{that only the}} doctrine of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> can account for its continuing use by the Court.|$|E
25|$|Originalism helps ensure {{predictability}} {{and protects}} against arbitrary {{changes in the}} interpretation of a constitution; to reject originalism implicitly repudiates the theoretical underpinning of another theory of stability in the law, <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to Bracton, {{there was}} little use of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> This was because the rolls {{containing}} the court records were largely unavailable for scrutiny, even by judges sitting on the bench. Bracton's use of the rolls led to promulgation of recorded cases {{in the form of}} a gloss. This had been an important innovation based on the glossator's practice from the Continent. The availability of previous decisions, even if 20 or more years old proved to be of great interest to nearly all practitioners of the law. This led directly to the Year Books. A single unique decision did not make precedent. Custom began to be dictated when several cases of similar fact pattern were decided by different courts in the same way. This was the beginning of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the highest}} court of Singapore and its final appellate court, under the {{principles}} of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> (judicial precedent) decisions of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court and State Courts. Even if judges in these courts disagree with the reasoning given by the Court of Appeal in particular cases, {{they are required to}} apply the legal principles laid down in those cases.|$|E
25|$|Most importantly, from a lawyer's perspective, is {{the fact}} that the {{principle}} of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> does not apply to tribunals. In other words, a tribunal adjudicator could legally make a decision that differs from a past decision, on the same subject and issues, delivered by the highest court in the land. Because a tribunal is not bound by legal precedent, established by itself or by a reviewing court, a tribunal is not a court even though it performs an important adjudicative function and contributes to the development of law like a court would do.|$|E
25|$|Sharia {{judicial}} proceedings have significant differences from other legal traditions, {{including those in}} both common law and civil law. Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, {{and there is no}} jury system. There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding precedents under the principle of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis,</b> and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{principles}} of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In turn, decisions of the High Court must be followed by District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. On the other hand, a Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges. As a matter of comity, though, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision {{unless there is a}} good reason to do so. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, {{it is up to the}} Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.|$|E
25|$|The final {{argument}} {{was that the}} principle of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> bound the Appellate Division to follow the precedent of the Ndlwana case, in which it had ruled that Parliament can adopt any procedure it sees fit and the courts have no power to question the validity of its acts. The court ruled that it was entitled to overrule its own previous decisions if they were clearly wrong. In Ndlwana {{there had been no}} discussion of the Statute of Westminster nor any argument for or against the conclusion drawn by the court, and the court therefore felt free to overrule it.|$|E
25|$|The Brown {{decision}} {{was a powerful}} moral statement clad in a weak constitutional analysis; Warren was never a legal scholar {{on a par with}} Frankfurter or a great advocate of particular doctrines, as was Black. Instead, he believed that in all branches of government common sense, decency, and elemental justice were decisive, not precedent (<b>stare</b> <b>decisis),</b> tradition or the text of the Constitution. He wanted results. He never felt that doctrine alone should be allowed to deprive people of justice. He felt racial segregation was simply wrong, and Brown, whatever its doctrinal defects, remains a landmark decision primarily because of Warren's interpretation of the equal protection clause to mean that children should not be shunted to a separate world reserved for minorities.|$|E
25|$|Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law {{are based}} on common-law principles. The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is {{developed}} by judges in courts, applying statute, precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases (<b>stare</b> <b>decisis).</b> The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{principles}} of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> (judicial precedent), Court of Appeal decisions are binding on the High Court and State Courts. As Singapore's final appellate court, the Court of Appeal {{is not required to}} follow its own previous decisions and the decisions of predecessor courts such as the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and may depart from or overrule such decisions if it thinks fit. However, it will generally not do so without a strong reason. The Court of Appeal is required, however, to abide by decisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal in certain situations. The Constitution of Singapore states that where the President has referred to the Tribunal a question concerning the Constitution's effect on a bill, no court– including the Court of Appeal– may subsequently question the Tribunal's opinion on the bill or, assuming the bill is found to be constitutional, the validity of any law based on the bill.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{is often}} said to use the civil law system, {{but it has a}} unique system that {{combines}} elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis with an element of its own common law long predating the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 (see Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, Scottish common law differed in that the use of precedent was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a precedent, and principles of natural justice and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This {{is not to say that}} the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.|$|E
500|$|More {{than two}} decades later, the Court reconsidered the meaning and propriety of its Barker {{decision}} in United States v. Title Ins. & Trust Co. (1923). There, the federal government sued {{on behalf of a}} group of Mission Indians holding an 1842 Mexican grant. The court cited reliance considerations of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> in declining the government's request to overrule Barker: ...|$|E
500|$|Harlan's {{jurisprudence}} {{is often}} characterized as conservative. He held precedent {{to be of}} great importance, adhering {{to the principle of}} <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> more closely than many of his Supreme Court colleagues. Unlike Justice Black, he eschewed strict textualism. While he believed that the original intention of the Framers should play an important part in constitutional adjudication, he also held that broad phrases like [...] "liberty" [...] in the Due Process Clause could be given an evolving interpretation.|$|E
500|$|The {{essence of}} British Common Law is the juror system: court judges (equivalent to British JPs) make case {{verdicts}} {{with the assistance}} of a group of eligible, court-appointed jurors who are members of the public. One feature of the Common Law system is the basis of legal precedent (<b>stare</b> <b>decisis)</b> in which judges refer to empirical evidence from previous cases of a similar category prior to handing out a final verdict. According to [...] of Hong Kong's Basic Law, judicial courts may refer to decisions which are rendered by courts of other common law jurisdictions as precedents (England, Canada and Australia). Judges from these jurisdictions are permitted to sit as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{certainty}} and {{the orderly}} development of legal principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis,</b> also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the ratio decidendi (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E
2500|$|Law {{professor}} Amy Barrett {{maintains that}} Thomas supports statutory <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> Her cited examples include Thomas's concurring opinion in Fogerty v. Fantasy, [...]|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stare</b> <b>decisis</b> is [...] "not an inexorable command", and the Supreme Court, since Marbury v. Madison (1803), {{has decided}} {{what the law}} is.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Roberts, {{with whom}} Justice Alito joined, wrote {{separately}} [...] "to address the important principles of judicial restraint and <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> implicated in this case".|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Burger, concurred in the {{judgment}} saying that <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> called for [...] "following the rule of Edwards in this context, but plainly the subject calls for reexamination." ...|$|E
2500|$|The above quoted {{language}} in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co. {{is not a}} holding of law in the case. (Compare Ratio decidendi, Precedent, <b>Stare</b> <b>decisis</b> and Obiter dictum for a fuller explanation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The most {{conscientious}} probing of {{the text}} and the interstices of the Sherman Law", wrote Frankfurter, [...] "fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball – the conditions under which that sport is carried on – from the scope of the Sherman Law but included football." [...] He was more concerned, however, with what he felt was undue respect for the doctrine of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis,</b> a concern he had voiced in International Boxing. [...] "Full respect for <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> does not require a judge to forgo his own convictions promptly after his brethren have rejected them", he concluded.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas spoke favorably {{about the}} concept of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis,</b> or {{standing}} by precedent, during his confirmation hearings, stating that [...] "stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision making, I {{think it is a}} very important and critical concept." [...] However, according to Antonin Scalia, Thomas [...] "doesn't believe in <b>stare</b> <b>decisis,</b> period." [...] This assessment is consistent with Thomas's record on the bench: factoring in length of tenure, Thomas urged overruling and joined in overruling precedents more frequently than any other justice during the Rehnquist Court.|$|E
2500|$|McReynolds {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} about {{the willingness of the}} majority to cast aside <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> and overrule precedent. [...] "The judgment seems to me to overrule, sub silentio, a century of precedents, and to leave the application of the rule uncertain and unpredictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alito {{wrote that}} [...] "It is a {{necessary}} concomitant {{of the doctrine of}} <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic. That...is the approach we take here. We do not extend Flast, but we also do not overrule it. We leave Flast as we found it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{principles}} of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. This means {{if there is a}} decision of the Court of Appeal that is relevant to a case being heard in the High Court, the High Court must apply it even if ...|$|E
2500|$|In Tinker v Poole , Lord Mansfield {{overcame the}} {{technical}} objections (traditionally held) that a distress (holding of a chattel to induce an {{action from the}} owner) was not a disposition of goods, and that trover could be an alternative to replevin. [...] This was a controversial opinion at the time, and was not necessarily viewed as legitimate <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Scalia {{objected to}} the Court's {{decision}} to revisit Bowers, pointing out many decisions from lower courts that relied on Bowers that might now need to be reconsidered. He noted that the same rationale used to overturn Bowers {{could have been used}} to overturn Roe v. Wade, which some of the Justices in the majority in Lawrence had upheld in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). Scalia also criticized the majority opinion for failing to give the same respect to <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> that three of those in the majority had insisted on in Casey. O'Connor's concurrence noted that Scalia's dissent conceded that if cases such as Romer v. Evans [...] "have <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> effect, Texas’ sodomy law would not pass scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, regardless of the type of rational basis review" [...] applied.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{ultimately}} overruled Aguilar. It noted that, while <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> is {{an important}} doctrine, the Court is not prohibited by precedent to review changes in law or making alterations to previous decisions. It concluded that prevailing Establishment Clause law had changed significantly since Aguilar was decided, making Aguilar no longer good law. In summarizing its position, the Court notes: ...|$|E
2500|$|So called [...] "priest–penitent" [...] privilege, which precludes forced {{testimony}} of confessions {{made to a}} priest, minister, or religious adviser are statutorily defined in the United States. [...] They vary between states. [...] In some cases, the privilege is confusing and ill-defined. [...] In others, there is recognized <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> (See: priest–penitent privilege, confessional privilege (United States), spousal privilege, executive privilege, reporter's privilege.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy Rosenberg, the plaintiff, {{challenged}} {{the definition of}} [...] "spouse" [...] in the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1, {{as a violation of}} Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada conceded that the definition of [...] "spouse" [...] in the Income Tax Act, in light of Egan, violated Section 15 of the Charter. Nonetheless, they contended that since Egan could not be distinguished from the case at hand, the violation must be upheld under Section 1 of the Charter as matter of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> The plaintiffs, by contrary, argued that Iacobucci's Section 1 analysis was controlling, pointing out that the plurality in Egan had only addressed the Section 1 issue obiter and it was, therefore, not binding under the doctrine of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> The Court held that Section 15 was indeed violated, but was nonetheless saved by Section 1 of the Charter.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> {{does not}} apply to tribunals, their adjudicators will likely {{nonetheless}} find a prior court decision on a similar subject to be highly persuasive and will likely follow the courts in order to ensure consistency in the law and to prevent the embarrassment of having their decisions overturned by the courts. [...] The same is true for past decisions of the tribunal.|$|E
2500|$|Justice McKenna {{devoted a}} vast {{portion of the}} {{majority}} opinion to a defense of Wong Wing v. United States in {{a prime example of}} the principle of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis.</b> [...] McKenna wrote that the United States “resists both the authority and extent of [...] by the citation of others, which, it asserts, modify or overrule it. [...] A review of it, therefore, is of initial importance.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While it is {{normally}} true that majority reasons are usually controlling under {{the doctrine of}} <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> (precedent), Egan v. Canada {{would appear to be}} an exception. The [...] "irrelevance" [...] approach which prevailed by plurality in Egan was also rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court in Miron v. Trudel, [...] 2 S.C.R. 418, in which the more [...] "orthodox" [...] Andrews approach prevailed by plurality.|$|E
2500|$|The dissent was {{somewhat}} formalistic in its {{objections to the}} majority finding. It stated that the principle of <b>stare</b> <b>decisis</b> was of too great weight to overrule a previous decision so easily, and that the case presented appeared {{to be more of}} a re-hearing of Aguilar than a new proceeding. The Dissent cited the Supreme Court's guidelines surrounding rehearings, accusing the Court of veiling its decision as a [...] "rethinking" [...] instead of a reversal of Aguilar. The Dissent summarized its own position, remarking: ...|$|E
