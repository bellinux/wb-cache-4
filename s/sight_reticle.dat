Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a <b>sight</b> <b>reticle</b> is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

50|$|Several issues noted were reliability, {{specifically}} with intensifier tubes being damaged due to moisture. This problem was fully addressed in final production. It was also noted the mount designed {{to secure the}} AN/PVS-4 to the M60 machine gun was difficult to install and prone to loss of zero. The <b>sight</b> <b>reticles</b> for both the M16 rifle and M14 rifle required firing a minimum of 20 rounds to seat before the zeroing procedures could begin, leading to an excessive expenditure of ammunition. The <b>sight</b> <b>reticles</b> were subsequently modified, requiring only 2 rounds for seating purposes. Early reticles for the M16/M203 could not be zeroed for each weapon simultaneously. Rubber eye guard separation from the sight was a common problem that was addressed.|$|R

5000|$|In this {{multi-service}} project, Air Force and United States Navy pilots {{evaluated the}} MiG-21, redesignated as the [...] "YF-110", {{in a variety}} of situations. The project's name came from the [...] "doughnut" [...] shaped <b>sight</b> <b>reticle</b> on the F-4 Phantom's canopy used to aim at the opposing aircraft. The inability of the Navy to disseminate the results of this highly classified project to combat pilots was part of the impetus to create the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School. The Have Doughnut tests were conducted at Area 51.|$|E
5000|$|The team {{responsible}} for the game decided not to create a version for consoles, nor add support for gamepad in the version for computers. According Pilestedt, after testing several different mechanical controls, decided to stay only with the keyboard and mouse because [...] "if you have high damage and you hit all the bullets, the game goes to be about who pulled the trigger first." [...] Due to this, the game has a system where the bullets hit the opponent only if the <b>sight</b> <b>reticle</b> is on the enemy, if otherwise the bullets will hit only the scenario, making a system with gamepad [...] "impossible". However, the version presented during the PAX East of 2012 had full support gamepad, which was removed after discussions about the game focus more on quick reflexes [...]|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{reflector}} sights, the holographic {{weapon sight}} {{does not use}} a reflected reticle system.Instead a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{that is part of}} the optical viewing window. Like the reflector sight, the holographic <b>sight's</b> <b>reticle</b> uses collimated light and therefore has an aim-point that can move with eye position. This is compensated for by having a holographic image that is set at a finite distance, in this case around 100 yards. The sight's parallax due to eye movement is the size of the optical window at close range and diminishes to zero at the set distance.|$|R

In {{the midst of}} the smiling return, the internal voice speaks again of the price of Castle's choice. We find now exactly what Castle's eternal war will cost him, as a picture details Castle's family in a <b>sighting</b> <b>reticle</b> reminiscent of the Punisher's skull icon. The voice {{goes on to say that}} it and Castle are in the same business though it has been at it for much longer and that Castle will keep it busy which implies that the voice could be the Devil or Death itself. Horrified, Castle embraces his smiling wife and eager children.|$|R
50|$|Wire reticles are {{the oldest}} type of reticles and are {{made out of}} metal wire or thread. They are mounted in an {{optically}} appropriate position in the telescopic <b>sight's</b> tube. Etched <b>reticles</b> are images of the desired reticle layout that are etched on an optic element. This optical element (lens) with the etched reticle is then mounted in the telescopic sights tube as an integrated part of the optics chain of the sight. When backlit through the ocular, a wire reticle will reflect incoming light and not present a fully opaque (black) reticle with high contrast. An etched reticle will stay fully opaque (black) if backlit. Etched reticles are considered by most {{to be a more}} refined solution and offer greater reticle layout flexibility. Because of this, some manufacturers can provide client-designed custom reticles on special order. In the more expensive and high-end contemporary telescopic <b>sights,</b> etched <b>reticles</b> dominate the market. In cheaper telescopic <b>sights,</b> wire <b>reticles</b> are still often mounted to avoid a rather specialized and costly production step.|$|R
50|$|The scope body {{is sealed}} {{and filled with}} nitrogen, which {{prevents}} fogging of optics and was designed to function within a -50 °C to 50 °C temperature range. For zeroing the telescopic <b>sight</b> the <b>reticle</b> can be adjusted by manipulating the elevation and windage turrets in 5 cm at 100 meters (0.5 mil or 1.72 MOA) increments.|$|R
5000|$|Red dot <b>sight</b> <b>reticles</b> are {{measured}} in minutes of angle, or [...] "MOA". MOA is a convenient measure for shooters using English units, since 1 MOA subtends approximately 1.0472 inches {{at a distance}} of 100 yards (91.44 m). This is generally rounded to 1 inch at 100 yards, which makes MOA a handy unit to use in ballistics. One of the most common reticles used in red dot sights is a small dot, covering 5 MOA (1.5 mrad). The 5 MOA (1.5 mrad) dot is small enough not to obscure most targets, and large enough to quickly acquire a proper [...] "sight picture". For many types of action shooting, a larger dot is preferred; 7 (2.0 mrad), 10 (2.9 mrad), 15 (4.4 mrad) or even 20 MOA (5.8 mrad) dots or rings are used; often these will be combined with horizontal and/or vertical lines to provide a level reference.|$|R
50|$|Radioactive {{isotopes}} {{can also}} be used as a light source, to provide an illuminated reticle for low-light condition aiming. In sights like the SUSAT or Elcan C79 Optical <b>Sight</b> tritium-illuminated <b>reticles</b> are used for low-light condition aiming. Trijicon Corporation uses tritium in their combat and hunting-grade firearm optics, including the ACOG. The (radioactive) tritium light source has to be replaced every 8-12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay.|$|R
50|$|The {{directional}} control was by two hand control grips with firing buttons. The left foot controlled the reflector <b>sight</b> range <b>reticle.</b> The right foot operated a push-to-talk intercom switch. The turret was electrically powered in azimuth and altitude. An emergency hand crank could {{be attached to}} reposition the turret from inside the aircraft fuselage. In {{the event of a}} power failure another crewman would use this to crank the turret into the vertical position to allow the gunner to exit.|$|R
50|$|Variable power {{telescopic}} <b>sights</b> with FFP <b>reticles</b> have {{no problems}} with point of impact shifts. Variable power telescopic <b>sights</b> with SFP <b>reticles</b> can have slight point-of-impact shifts through their magnification range, caused by the positioning of the reticle in the mechanical zoom mechanism in the rear part of the telescopic sight. Normally these impact shifts are insignificant, but accuracy-oriented users, who wish to use their telescopic sight trouble-free at several magnification levels, often opt for FFP reticles. Around the year 2005 Zeiss was the first high-end European telescopic sight manufacturer who brought out variable magnification military grade telescopic sight models with rear SFP mounted reticles. They get around impermissible impact shifts by laboriously hand-adjusting every military grade telescopic sight. The American high-end telescopic sight manufacturer U.S. Optics Inc. also offers variable magnification military grade telescopic sight models with SFP mounted reticles.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{definition}} of pi, in a circle with a diameter of one there are 2000π milliradians (≈ 6283.185 mil) per full turn. In other words, one real milliradian covers just under [...] of the circumference of a circle, which is {{the definition}} used by telescopic rifle <b>sight</b> manufacturers in <b>reticles</b> for stadiametric rangefinding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{market for}} {{military}} telescopic sights intended for military long-range shooting is highly competitive. Several high end optics manufacturers are constantly adapting and improving their telescopic sights to fulfill specific demands of military organizations. Two European {{companies that are}} active this field are Schmidt & Bender and Zeiss/Hensoldt. American companies that are also very active in this field are Nightforce, U.S. Optics Inc. and Leupold. These high end sighting components generally cost €1500 / $2000 or more. Typical options for military telescopic <b>sights</b> are <b>reticle</b> illumination for use under adverse light circumstances and the presentation of scope settings or ballistic relevant environmental measurements data to the operator through the sights ocular.|$|R

50|$|The M49A1 sub-caliber device, {{which uses}} NATO 7.62 mm rounds, is {{typically}} used for zeroing the sight and for qualifying purposes. The sight would be visually zeroed by setting crossed strings over the gun barrel opening (there was a rubber loop and notches {{at the end}} of the barrel to facilitate holding the string in the correct position), then looking through the barrel of the sub-caliber device (and crossed strings) and setting the fixed stadia, <b>reticle</b> <b>sight</b> to the same target. The sub-caliber rounds could then be used to further refine the zero and to qualify.|$|R
5000|$|The Bor is a bullpup-{{configuration}} bolt-action magazine-fed sniper rifle. The configuration provides increased accuracy {{by allowing}} a barrel length of 680 mm, but minimizes the overall length of 1038 mm. Weight is further reduced without sacrificing accuracy {{by the use}} of a free-floating fluted barrel. The muzzle is fitted with a double-baffle muzzle brake, which is claimed to reduce recoil by up to 30%. The [...] "in-line" [...] design of the barrel-receiver group also directs recoil rearwards in a straight line, minimizing muzzle flip. A sturdy adjustable bipod is fitted {{to the front of the}} fore-end. The rifle features a fully adjustable buttstock and cheek riser. A folding/adjustable monopod located behind the magazine on the inside of the buttstock can be used to support the rifle in firing position during extended periods of deployment. No iron or emergency sights are provided; a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail is mounted above the centerline of the barrel, over the receiver area for mounting various optical sights. The standard telescopic sight is a Leupold 4.5-14×50, with <b>sight</b> grid mil-dot <b>reticle,</b> parallax correction and an adjustment range of 100 MOA.|$|R
5000|$|Reflector sights have {{unlimited}} eye relief, {{meaning that}} the user may place his eye at any distance from the <b>sight</b> and the <b>reticle</b> will remain visible. This allows flexibility in mounting and shooting position. The CompM4 uses Aimpoint's [...] "parallax-free" [...] optical correction system, meaning there is minimal induced optical error that would shift the point of aim relative to the sight's optical axis as the user's eye moves off-center {{in relation to the}} sight. The sight itself is parallax-free at around 50 yards, {{meaning that the}} red dot will not change position relative to the target based on eye position at that range. As in other reflex sights, the point of aim will change position based on eye position at other ranges with the maximum error being equal to the diameter of the sight's optical window at short range. There are currently two variants available; the standard CompM4 and the CompM4S, the latter being the same in terms of features and functionality, but having the battery compartment & power control knob mounted {{near the bottom of the}} sight instead of near the top.|$|R
