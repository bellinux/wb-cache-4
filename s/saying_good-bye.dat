25|$|Charly Garc√≠a and Nito Mestre {{decided it}} was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most {{important}} acoustic rock band <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> to 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E
500|$|... "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna, {{taken from}} her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998). It was written by Madonna and Rick Nowels, and was {{produced}} by the singer with William Orbit and Patrick Leonard. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on September 22, 1998, being additionally distributed as a double A-Side single in the United Kingdom with [...] "Little Star". Lyrically, the track talks about how free and empowering <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> or ending a relationship can feel. The melancholy electronica ballad features shuffle beats, acoustic guitars and sweeping strings arranged by Craig Armstrong.|$|E
2500|$|Olaf {{is first}} seen during {{a series on}} January 19, 1989, in which he visits Snoopy. During this sequence, Lucy enters with Olaf in an [...] "ugly dog" [...] contest, which he wins (much to his disappointment). He is pretty chubby {{compared}} to Snoopy's other siblings. He appears again in 1994 (beginning February 14), where he, Andy, and Spike visit Snoopy, {{who is in the}} hospital. After Snoopy gets better, the three brothers leave without <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye.</b> This is the first appearance of Andy in the strip.|$|E

2500|$|The day {{his term}} expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese {{authorities}} {{to be made}} docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but {{had to wait until}} 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> to his former friends and colleagues, a move that may have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was [...] "unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment".|$|E
2500|$|During seasons one and two, {{the opening}} {{sequence}} begins {{with images of}} Balki and Larry wiping sideways from {{opposite sides of the}} screen to meet in the middle, with the series title superimposed on top. [...] Larry is shown <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> to his family as he leaves his home in Wisconsin, and drives to Chicago in his old red Ford Mustang. [...] The sequence then shifts to Balki, who is shown making his own farewells on Mypos before being driven off {{on the back of a}} horsecart, sitting alongside a box mislabeled [...] "America or Burst". [...] Balki is next seen on the tramp steamer as he sights the Statue of Liberty, then on a bus, presumably making his way to Chicago. [...] After a brief shot of Larry driving under a [...] "Welcome to Chicago" [...] sign (in reality, located on eastbound Interstate 190 leading out of O'Hare International Airport), the sequence ends with the same shot of Balki and Larry together that began the sequence. [...] The first season featured a script font for the series title and credits. [...] For the second season, the show's title appears more similar to later seasons, and the script font is replaced with the fonts similar to that used in the remaining seasons. [...] The Lake Shore Drive footage is now shown correctly. [...] Additionally, the Larry and Balki sequences are shortened so that brief clips from some of the early episodes could be shown.|$|E
