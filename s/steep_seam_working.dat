30|$|The <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> {{refers to}} the coal seam with the dip angle of 35 °– 55 °. Since the dip angle of coal seam is {{relatively}} large, the working face is vulnerable to the instability such as the bottom heave, slippage, etc. The drawback would induce slanting, topple and fall, gliding of hydraulic supports, etc. In this respect, {{it is challenging to}} perform coupling stability control of hydraulic support and surrounding rock. The longwall mining system instability and coal gangue splashing menace the mining safety. The <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> mining has long been a challenge in global coal mining industry. In China, the <b>steep</b> dipping <b>seam</b> is evenly distributed in each major mining site.

30|$|To {{accommodate}} surrounding rock structure stability control {{problem in}} underground mining, we study the coupling effect principle between hydraulic support and surrounding rock, {{and develop a}} series of longwall mining technology and equipment, which solves four common technical problems that significantly undermine coal mining safety, efficiency, and high recovery and extraction rates. Based on the coupling characteristic between mining-induced stress field and supporting stress field of hydraulic support, we identify six controllable factors {{in the application of}} hydraulic support to surrounding rock, and further reveal the relationship between hydraulic support and surrounding rock in terms of the strength, the stiffness, and the stability coupling. Our findings provide a plausible solution to the longwall mining technical problem with 6 – 8  m mining height. By analyzing the dynamic disequilibrium characteristics between hydraulic support and surrounding rock, we propose the intelligent top coal caving control method and the high-coal-recovery-rate technology for fully mechanized caving faces. With the invention of this technology, China is likely to lead {{the world in terms of}} the fully mechanized top coal caving mining technology. We are also the first to employ the intelligent coupling technology between hydraulic support and surrounding rock, and automated mining mode, and supporting system cooperative control with automatic organization.

30|$|In China, {{there is}} {{approximately}} 1341 Bt of proven coal resource, including 279.58 Bt of basic coal resource for coal mine construction. Among them, coal resource in thick coal seams accounts for 44  % {{of the total}} available. The annual underground coal production from thick coal seams exceeds 45  % of total coal production. Since the Eighties in the last century, {{there have been many}} research projects focusing on mechanical coal extraction from thick coal seams. The mining technologies and systems for thick and ultra-thick coal seams have been gradually developed in China. Until recently, there have been three major mechanical mining methods for thick coal seams, i.e., a fully mechanized longwall top-coal caving mining method (thereafter LTCC mining method), a fully mechanized sub-level coal mining method, and a fully mechanized mining with a large mining height method. There are some limitations with the fully mechanized sub-level coal mining method, including the thickness variation of coal seams, spontaneous combustion, unit mining cost and efficiency. Due to the low production efficiency (Qian and Shi 2003; Wang 2005; 2006 a; Mao and Yao 2010; Wang 2010 a), the fully mechanized sub-level coal mining method is currently replaced by the other two mining methods. Compared with the fully mechanized sub-level coal mining method, the fully mechanized coal mining with a large mining height method can reduce the amount of roadway development, mitigate the tension between mining and development, and simplify the mining process. With the progress of mining technologies and equipment in China, the fully mechanized coal mining with a large mining height method has seen widely used (Yan and Yin 2008; Yan 2009; Yan et al. 2011), and has achieved significant mining profit and coal recovery. The method is only applicable to the coal seams of low dip, relative stable, and good roof conditions, and is also limited by the shearer’s cutting height and coal wall spalling. For this reason, the mining height for one mining pass is 7.0  m (Wang et al. 2012), and cannot meet the requirement for safe and efficient mining in ultra-thick coal seams above 7  m. In terms of ultra-thick coal seams above 7  m, the top-coal caving mining method is the first choice. For coal seams with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 14  m, the top-coal caving mining method can be applied as the technologies and the equipment are well established and manufactured. In order to achieve safe and efficient coal extraction in ultra-thick coal seams with thicknesses ranging from 14 to 20  m, the authors propose a fully mechanized large mining height longwall top-coal caving mining method (thereafter LLTCC mining method), developed a full range of technologies and equipment for a LLTCC mining operation. The technologies and equipment developed have been successfully applied in the Tashan coal mine in Datong, China, and has achieved a production of 10 Mtpa at a LLTCC mining operation in the ultra-thick coal seam. In the early twentieth century, the top-coal caving mining method was applied at <b>steep</b> <b>seams</b> in France, Spain and former Yugoslavia. Due to the low mechanical levels in mining, the method was actually an alternative of the high caving mining method, which was only used as a special mining method under complex geological conditions. At the end of forties and early fifties of the twentieth century, the top-coal caving mining method was used to extract the thick coal seams in the former Soviet Union, France and former Yugoslavia. With the progress of hydraulic support technology, the fully mechanized top-coal caving technology was improved and successfully applied in some countries.|$|R
