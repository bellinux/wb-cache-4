40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} electronic beam steering for a smart antenna system based on a switched parasitic array. The antenna system {{is made up of}} circular array of half wave dipoles, with four parasitic elements positioned equidistantly, surrounding one active central element. All parasitic elements are assumed to be switched between short-circuit and opencircuit states to change their resonant length. The switching between parasitic elements’ states is attained by connecting a switch that assumes ON/OFF states at the centre of each parasitic element. This allows some parasitic elements to act as reflectors while <b>shortcircuited,</b> whereas other parasitic elements act as directors when open-circuited. Thus, the direction of maximum gain is controlled by open- and <b>shortcircuiting</b> the parasitic elements. By appropriately selecting correct combination of short- and opencircuited parasitic elements together with the active element, a set of radiation patterns is formed covering the horizontal plane. Results for the horizontal coverage are presented with the main beam(s) directed at 00, 900, 1800, and/or 2700, as well as for an omnidirectional configuration resemblance. It is expected that increasing the number of parasitic elements will improve directional properties further...|$|R
