5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below). The board was <b>sturdier</b> than the previous edition's paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E

5|$|While the jaguar {{closely resembles}} the leopard, it is <b>sturdier</b> and heavier, {{and the two}} animals can be {{distinguished}} by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually darker, and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a <b>sturdier</b> frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E

5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine {{was more than the}} gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the <b>sturdier</b> DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The biggest festival yet {{was held}} in 1990; however, {{the day after the}} festival ended, {{violence}} – between the security guards and new age travellers (the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge) – led to the organisers taking 1991 and 1996 off to rethink the festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a <b>sturdier</b> fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was hot and dry.|$|E
5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a wooden frame and a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a <b>sturdier</b> mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E
40|$|Injuries from falls are {{the main}} cause of trauma {{morbidity}} that leads to mortality among the elderly. One prevention strategy is to wear <b>sturdy</b> shoes.

5|$|HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the , {{which saw}} Royal Navy service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally a hunter of privateers, {{she was also}} {{designed}} to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and <b>sturdier</b> build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.|$|E
5|$|Other Mycenas that {{resemble}} M.adscendens include M.alphitophora and M.stylobates. The former is distinguished from M.adscendens by a stem base {{that is not}} swollen or disc-like, the latter by its larger and <b>sturdier</b> fruit body and lack of granules on the cap. A poorly known Japanese species, M.cryptomeriicola, is similar to M.adscendens, but has non-amyloid spores and lacks clamps. M.nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M.adscendens by microscopic characteristics: M.nucicola has four-spored basidia, clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue, and the spores are less broad (typically 4.2–5µm). The Finnish species M.occulta grows on the decaying needles of Norway spruce and Scots pine. It differs from M.adscendens in that its gills do not form a pseudocollarium, it lacks clamps in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium, and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to <b>sturdier</b> carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

5|$|Between the Acts of Union in the mid-16th {{century and}} the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, a period of great {{rebuilding}} {{took place in the}} Kingdom of England, of which Wales was now annexed, and this is reflected in the structures that were built within the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economic state of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and therefore producing higher profits. This profit was reflected in the new farm houses built in the Rhondda {{and for the first time}} an emphasis on domestic comfort became apparent in the design of the dwellings. Many of the new farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms, though of a much <b>sturdier</b> and permanent quality than the Medieval platform houses. A popular style of building was the long-house, a building which combined the house and cowshed into a single building. By 1840, at least 160 farms existed in the Rhondda, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few surviving buildings, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Blaenrhondda, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island did not have much time to prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden homes on the beach for <b>sturdier</b> brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated a moratorium on all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was <b>sturdier</b> and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E

5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, <b>sturdier</b> mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E
5|$|This spotted cat {{most closely}} resembles the leopard physically, {{although}} it is usually larger and of <b>sturdier</b> build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer {{to those of the}} tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator {{at the top of the}} food chain (an apex predator). It is a keystone species, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain.|$|E
