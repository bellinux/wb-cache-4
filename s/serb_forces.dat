5|$|After {{the strikes}} at Otoka and Dvor, Bosnian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> {{continued}} to target NATO aircraft with surface-to-air missiles, while advancing against the Bihać enclave. On 24 November, <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> fired radar-guided missiles at two British Tornado F3 aircraft. The next day, <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> fired on two NATO F-16s. In {{response to this}} growing SAM threat, and the UNPROFOR hostages, NATO suspended flights in Bosnian airspace on 2 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{resulted in}} 178 dead, 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops. Bosnian Serb losses were 900 killed {{and more than}} 1,000 wounded. In September and October, 6,500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living {{in the area of}} Banja Luka or Prijedor were expelled from their homes by Bosnian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b> Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near Sanski Most, believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by Bosnian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> in April 1992.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September, UNPROFOR again {{requested}} NATO {{air support}} in the Sarajevo area after <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> attacked a French armored personnel carrier. In response, two British SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft struck near a Serb tank, destroying it.|$|E
50|$|In Bahutaj, the <b>Serbs</b> <b>forced</b> Ramadan Mehmeti and {{his companions}} to perform {{balancing}} acts and then cut their throats. They carried off 10 horses.|$|R
50|$|The city {{endured a}} long siege by Bosnian <b>Serbs</b> <b>forces</b> between 1993 and 1994 during the Bosnian War, when {{the area was}} the scene of heavy {{fighting}} and the population had to be supplied by airdrops.|$|R
50|$|After the 2008 Kosovo {{declaration}} of independence the commander of NATO forces in Kosovo said on 20 February 2008 {{that he did not}} plan to step up security in the tense north despite Kosovo <b>Serbs</b> <b>forcing</b> the temporary closure of two boundary crossings between Kosovo and uncontested Serbia.|$|R
5|$|In July, in {{an attempt}} to salvage what {{remained}} of Yugoslavia, the JNA forces were involved in operations against predominantly Croat areas. In July the Serb-led Territorial Defence Forces started their advance on Dalmatian coastal areas in Operation Coast-91. By early August, large areas of Banovina were overrun by <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b> As the <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} Croatia {{declared}} its independence, the Yugoslav army and other <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> held {{something less than}} one-third of the Croatian territory, mostly in areas with a predominantly ethnic Serb population. The JNA military strategy partly consisted of extensive shelling, at times irrespective of the presence of civilians. As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} escalated into armed {{incidents in}} the majority-Serb populated areas. The Serbs attacked Croatian police units in Pakrac in early March, while one Josip Jović is widely reported as the first police officer killed by <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> {{as part of the}} war, during the Plitvice Lakes incident in late March 1991.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Croat civilians in {{hospitals}} and shelters marked with a red cross were targeted by <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b> There were numerous well-documented war crimes against civilians and prisoners of war perpetrated by Serb and Yugoslav forces in Croatia: the Dalj killings, the Lovas massacre, the Široka Kula massacre, the Baćin massacre, the Saborsko massacre, the Škabrnja massacre, the Voćin massacre, and the Zagreb rocket attacks.|$|E
5|$|After UNPROFOR, Smith {{served as}} General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland from 1996 to 1998 towards the {{conclusion}} of the Troubles. In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Smith was NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe. NATO commenced air strikes against <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> led by Slobodan Milošević, again lacking defined objectives, while Smith worked to incorporate the bombing raids into an overall strategy.|$|E

50|$|After the breakeup of Yugoslavia {{and when}} Bosnian War start, Grbavica {{a quarter of}} the city of Sarajevo where Grbavica Stadium is located was on front lines of battle between Bosnian army and Bosnian <b>Serbs</b> <b>forces.</b> Many members of The Maniacs joined Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Zelene beretke. One of them was Dževad Begić-Đilda. He was one of the founders and leader of The Maniacs. Dževad Begić was killed 1992 by sniper shot when he was trying to save wounded civilians.|$|R
5|$|In August 1995, {{following}} Operation Storm, Croatia regained {{control of}} territories previously held by Croatian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces,</b> {{with the exception}} of eastern Slavonia—the region around Erdut. Eastern Slavonia was gradually transferred to Croatian control based on the Erdut Agreement signed on 12 November 1995, and the transfer, facilitated by United Nations peacekeepers, was completed on 15 January 1998.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Croatia alleged {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the {{massacre}} in Voćin {{was part of}} a larger campaign of genocide targeting the Croat population of Slavonia. In 2015, the ICJ ruled that <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> had not committed genocide in Croatia, and stated that the Croatian legal team had failed to prove that any mass killing had taken place in Voćin.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, the ZNG {{deployed}} A Company, 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry Brigade to Pakrac {{in order}} to reinforce police defences in the area. Violence in western Slavonia flared up once more on 3–4 September, when Croatian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> attacked the villages of Četekovac, Čojlug and Balinci south of Slatina, killing two policemen and 21 civilians.|$|E
50|$|It {{was found}} that on 27 June 1992, during the ethnic {{cleansing}} of the Drina Valley by the Bosnian <b>Serbs,</b> <b>forces</b> {{under the command of}} Milan Lukić forced approximately 70 Bosniak civilians into one room of in a house in the settlement of Bikavac, near Višegrad. After the captives were robbed, the house was set on fire and the occupants were left to burn alive. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Trial Chamber found that at least 60 Bosniak civilians were killed in the fire.|$|R

500|$|In April 1994, Bosnian <b>Serbs</b> <b>forces</b> {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the UN Safe Area of Goražde. [...] Initially, US Secretary of Defense William Perry told reporters that the United States would [...] "not enter the war to stop" [...] the Serbs from overrunning Goražde, and other senior officials publicly downplayed the possibility of using air strikes. Several days into the attack, however, a number of UNPROFOR soldiers were injured, and one was killed by Serb fire. Thus, General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR Commander, requested NATO strikes under the mandate of UNSCR 836.|$|R
5|$|The attacking force {{included}} JNA soldiers conscripted {{from across}} Yugoslavia, {{members of the}} TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force. At their peak, the Yugoslav and <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> {{in the vicinity of}} Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces,</b> the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced to leave their homes. The bodies {{of the victims were}} retrieved from a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre-war level.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E

50|$|Close to Sandići, on {{the main}} road from Bratunac to Konjević Polje, one witness {{describes}} the <b>Serbs</b> <b>forcing</b> a Bosniak man to call other Bosniaks down from the mountains. Some 200 to 300 men, including the witness' brother, followed his instructions and descended to meet the VRS, presumably expecting some exchange of prisoners would take place. The witness hid behind a tree {{to see what would happen}} next. He watched as the men were lined up in seven ranks, each some forty metres in length, with their hands behind their heads; they were then mowed down by machine gun fire.|$|R
50|$|On 4 October 2005, {{the working}} group said they had {{identified}} 25,083 people {{who were involved in}} the massacre, including 19,473 members of various Bosnian <b>Serb</b> armed <b>forces</b> that actively gave orders or directly took part in the massacre.|$|R
5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, {{during the}} Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b> A two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell {{slammed into a}} Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian <b>Serb</b> <b>forces</b> for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|The Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia {{was signed}} by Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Franjo Tuđman, President of the Republic of Croatia, in Zagreb on 21 July 1992 during the Bosnian and Croatian wars for {{independence}} from Yugoslavia. It established cooperation, albeit inharmonious, between the two {{and served as a}} basis for joint defense against <b>Serb</b> <b>forces.</b> It also placed the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) under the command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH).|$|E
