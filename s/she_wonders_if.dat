500|$|Musically, [...] "Radar" [...] {{runs through}} a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and {{accompanied}} by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> he knows what she is feeling. [...] "Radar" [...] received mixed reviews from critics; some called {{it one of the}} highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed.

She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E
