40|$|We {{consider}} Shannon sampling {{theory for}} <b>sampling</b> <b>sets</b> which are unions of shifted lattices. These sets {{are not necessarily}} periodic. A function f can be reconstructed from its samples provided the <b>sampling</b> <b>set</b> {{and the support of}} the Fourier transform of f satisfy certain compatibility conditions. An explicit reconstruction formula is given for <b>sampling</b> <b>sets</b> which are unions of two shifted lattices. While explicit formulas for unions of more than two lattices are possible, it is more convenient to use a recursive algorithm. The analysis is presented in the general framework of locally compact abelian groups, but several specific examples are given, including a numerical example implemented in MATLAB. Our methods also provide a new tool for designing <b>sampling</b> <b>sets</b> of minimal density...|$|R

25|$|Earth's surface albedo is {{regularly}} estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments {{on board the}} Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a <b>sample</b> <b>set</b> of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations {{are based on the}} bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo.|$|E
25|$|All {{statistical}} hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II errors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect {{the disease in}} some proportion {{of people who do}}n't have it, and will fail to detect the disease in some proportion of people who do have it. A test's probability of making a type I error is denoted by α. A test's probability of making a type II error is denoted by β. These error rates are traded off against each other: for any given <b>sample</b> <b>set,</b> the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error. For a given test, the only way to reduce both error rates is to increase the sample size, and this may not be feasible.|$|E

40|$|Control charts are {{the most}} {{important}} statistical process control tool for monitoring variations in a process. A number of articles are available in the literature for the X̄ control chart based on simple random <b>sampling,</b> ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling,</b> median-ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling</b> (MRSS), extreme-ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling,</b> double-ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling,</b> double median-ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling</b> and median double-ranked <b>set</b> <b>sampling.</b> In this study, we highlight some limitations of the existing ranked set charting structures. Besides, we propose different runs rules-based control charting structures under a variety of sampling strategies. We evaluate the performance of the control charting structures using power curves as a performance criterion. We observe that the proposed merger of varying runs rules schemes with different sampling strategies improve significantly the detection ability of location control charting structures. More specifically, the MRSS performs the best under both single- and double-ranked set strategies with varying runs rules schemes. We also include a real-life example to explain the proposal and highlight its significance for practical data sets...|$|R

2500|$|The {{clustering}} above can {{be performed}} {{without regard to the}} identities of the residues, or it can be residue-specific. [...] That is, for any given input sequence of amino acids, a clustering can be derived using only samples found in the PDB with the same sequence in the k-mer fragment. This requires more computational work than deriving a sequence-independent fragment library but can potentially produce more accurate models. Conversely, a larger <b>sample</b> <b>set</b> is required, and one may not achieve full coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Naive {{interpretation}} of statistics derived from data sets that include outliers may be misleading. For example, {{if one is}} calculating the average temperature of 10 objects in a room, and nine of them are between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, but an oven is at 175°C, the median of the data will be between 20 and 25°C but the mean temperature will be between 35.5 and 40°C. In this case, the median better reflects the temperature of a randomly sampled object (but not {{the temperature in the}} room) than the mean; naively interpreting the mean as [...] "a typical sample", equivalent to the median, is incorrect. As illustrated in this case, outliers may indicate data points that belong to a different population {{than the rest of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Numerous other spiders {{have been}} {{associated}} with necrotic bites in medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the desert recluse (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely. The hobo spider and the yellow sac spider have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question. So far, no known necrotoxins have been isolated from the venom of any of these spiders, and some arachnologists have disputed the accuracy of spider identifications carried out by bite victims, family members, medical responders, and other non-experts in arachnology. There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of these spiders. In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when [...] "questionable" [...] identifications were excluded from the <b>sample</b> <b>set.</b> (For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider bites, see the list of spiders having medically significant venom.) ...|$|E

This paper {{focuses on the}} maximal gap of a <b>sampling</b> <b>set</b> for the iterative algorithm in shift invariant spaces, which provides an explicit formula to calculate the maximal gap of a <b>sampling</b> <b>set</b> {{in terms of a}} generator of the undertaken shift invariant spaces.

40|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} (FTIR), a nondestructive test, {{has been successfully}} applied as an investigative technique to Carboniferous-age seed ferns, and some true ferns, but not to living ferns. In this study, we applied the technique to the tree fern Cyathea caracasana that grows in bright sunlight in the Andean mountains to primarily test applicability to a living fern. The secondary purpose concerns accumulating phytochemical parameters for a comparative study of Carboniferous palaeocological counterparts. The study sample comprises two oven-dried ultimate pinnae that are subdivided into five <b>sample</b> <b>sets,</b> designed to represent sterile pinnate tips, fertile basal pinnule portions, empty sporangia enveloped in indusia removed from the latter, and the ultimate pinna rachis. Two additional <b>sample</b> <b>sets</b> were used for spectral quality control. We document that FTIR furnished quality spectra suitable for the interpretation of phytochemical calculations from these <b>sample</b> <b>sets.</b> Moreover, based on the absorbance spectra, {{we were able to}} reduce the five <b>sample</b> <b>sets</b> to three related-chemical groups. The reduction is principally based on aliphatic (carbon-atom joined open chain structures) and oxygen-containing moieties, but factoring into the related chemical groups the cellulose, mirroring, although not perfectly, predominating organ tissue in the subdivision of the <b>sample</b> <b>sets.</b> In effect, we have isolated the main chemical parameters for the foliage and sporangia (excluding spores) of C. caracasana...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the 1. 5 μm {{photoluminescence}} (PL) from Er ions after annealing two different <b>sample</b> <b>sets</b> in the temperature range 500 °C to 1100 °C. The different <b>sample</b> <b>sets</b> were made by magnetron sputtering from composite targets of Si+SiO 2 +Er and Ge+SiO 2 +Er respectively for the different <b>sample</b> <b>sets.</b> The annealing induces Si - and Ge-nanoclusters respectively in the different film sets. The PL peak reaches its maximum intensity after annealing at 700 °C for samples with Ge nanoclusters and after annealing at 800 °C for samples with Si. No luminescence from nanoclusters was detected in neither <b>sample</b> <b>sets.</b> This is interpreted as an energy transfer from the nanocluster to Er atoms. Transmission electron microscopy shows that after annealing to the respective temperature yielding the maximum PL intensity both the Ge and Si clusters are non-crystalline. Here we mainly compare the spectral shape of Er luminescence emitted in these different nanostructured matrixes. The PL spectral shapes are clearly different and witness a different local environment for the Er ions. Comment: Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions ([URL]...|$|R
