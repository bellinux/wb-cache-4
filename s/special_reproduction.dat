40|$|Thanks to {{developments}} in medical technology, artificial reproduction {{has made a}} lot of progress during the last decades. This makes it possible for a lot of infertile couples still to have a baby of their own, biologically related or not. In case of artificial reproduction, parenthood is coloured in a very <b>special</b> way: <b>reproduction</b> and sexuality, biological and social parenthood are separated from each other. Following from this evolution, a lot of new questions are thrown up in all the disciplines that are somehow concerned with this matter. One of the central subjects in this discussion is the question to the well-being of the families that applied to these techniques and the children born out of it. Concentrating on this, in this article we question the chances and risks of these <b>special</b> ways of <b>reproduction,</b> for the parent-child interaction. Initially, a literature-based review of the specific aspects of having a child by artificial reproduction (the infertility problem, the medical context, the artificial character of the conception, the intervention of the doctor and the pregnancy) and their potential significance for the parent-child interaction is given. Next, we describe the research findings in this domain. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} progeny {{of mammals}} the two parental genomes are differentially expressed according to imprinting marks, and embryos {{with only a}} uniparental genetic contribution die 1, 2, 3. Gene expression that {{is dependent on the}} parent of origin has also been observed in the offspring of flowering plants, and mutations in the imprinting machinery lead to embryonic lethality, primarily affecting the development of the endosperm—a structure in the seed that nourishes the embryo, analogous to the function of the mammalian placenta 4. Here we have generated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds in which the endosperm is of uniparental, that is, maternal, origin. We demonstrate that imprinting in developing seeds can be bypassed and viable albeit smaller seedlings can develop from seeds lacking a paternal contribution to the endosperm. Bypassing is only possible if the mother is mutant for any of the FIS-class genes, which encode Polycomb group chromatin-modifying factors. Thus, these data provide functional evidence that the action of the FIS complex balances the contribution of the paternal genome. As flowering plants have evolved a <b>special</b> <b>reproduction</b> system with a parallel fusion of two female with two male gametes, our findings support the hypothesis that only with the evolution of double fertilization did the action of the FIS genes become a requirement for seed development. Furthermore, our data argue for a gametophytic origin of endosperm in flowering plants, thereby supporting a hypothesis raised in 1900 by Eduard Strasburger...|$|E

Random genetic drift also reduces the variance. The relationship between the mean and variance at equilibrium of the number of replicating units per genome in the population was derived. The results obtained will be useful in understanding various observations on repeated DNA which presumably does not contain genetic information and which is likely to be selectively neutral...|$|R

This digenean trematode has a <b>special</b> aspect of <b>reproduction</b> in {{that there is an}} asexual amplification stage in the snail intermediate host, yielding thousands of clonal cercariae that infect the vertebrate final host. Although empirical evidence is still scarce, this feature is likely to affect population genetics of natural schistosome populations. Other important factors are geography and host mobility. Little attention has however been paid to the impact of host-specific factors on the distribution of schistosome strains, although this question is important from both an evolutionary and epidemiological point of view. We therefore assessed the genetic diversity within and between natural S. mansoni populations in Northern Senegal, taking into account the impact of the complex life-cycle characteristics. F-statistics revealed a random parasite distribution (panmixia) that correlated with high host mobility. In addition, we found significantly higher inbreeding values (Fis) for parasite populations within children than those within adults. These results confirm the hypothesis that human hosts function as ‘genetic mixing bowls’, accumulating parasite strains during their lives.

40|$|Reproduction data {{collected}} through standard bioassays are classically analyzed by regression {{in order to}} fit exposure-response curves and estimate ECx values (x% Effective Concentration). But regression is often misused on such data, ignoring statistical issues related to i) the <b>special</b> nature of <b>reproduction</b> data (count data), ii) a potential inter-replicate variability and iii) a possible concomitant mortality. This paper offers new insights in dealing with those issues. Concerning mortality, particular attention was paid not to waste any valuable data - by dropping all the replicates with mortality - or to bias ECx values. For that purpose we defined a new covariate summing the observation periods during which each individual contributes to the reproduction process. This covariate was then used to quantify reproduction - for each replicate at each concentration - {{as a number of}} offspring per individual-day. We formulated three exposure-response models differing by their stochastic part. Those models were fitted to four datasets and compared using a Bayesian framework. The individual-day unit proved to be a suitable approach to use all the available data and prevent bias in the estimation of ECx values. Furthermore, a non-classical negative-binomial model was shown to correctly describe the inter-replicate variability observed in the studied datasets...|$|R

Thirty years ago farmers liberally sprayed DDT on fields throughout America. At that time scientists had not yet recognized the devastating effect this toxic chemical could exert on animals, much less people. Then came troubling reports of the pesticide's feminizing effect on wildlife. Some heavily exposed male birds exhibited at least partially developed female sex organs (1). The most visible symptom of the pesticide's reproductive havoc was a lethal thinning of eggshells in bald eagles and other birds (2). In gulls, which are less susceptible to shell thinning, DDT-exposed females began cohabiting with other females-the so-called "lesbian gulls " (3). DDT appears to exert these changes by mimicking the female hormone estrogen (1). Although the United States banned the pesticide in 1972, DDT remains a very contemporary threat.

40|$|<b>Special</b> issue Fish <b>Reproduction.</b> [...] 23 pages, 8 figuresOne of {{the major}} {{objectives}} of the aquaculture industry is {{the production of a}} large number of viable eggs with high survival. Major achievements have been made in recent years in improving protocols for higher efficiency of egg production and viability of progeny. Main gaps remain, however, in understanding the dynamic processes associated with oogenesis, the formation of an egg, from the time that germ cells turn into oogonia, until the release of ova during spawning in teleosts. Recent studies on primordial germ-cells, yolk protein precursors and their processing within the developing oocyte, the deposition of vitamins in eggs, structure and function of egg envelopes and oocyte maturation processes, further reveal the complexity of oogenesis. Moreover, numerous circulating endocrine and locally-acting paracrine and autocrine factors regulate the various stages of oocyte development and maturation. Though it is clear that the major regulators during vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation are the pituitary gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and sex steroids, the picture emerging from recent studies is of complex hormonal cross-talk at all stages between the developing oocyte and its surrounding follicle layers to ensure coordination of the various processes that are involved in the production of a fertilizable egg. In this review we aim at highlighting recent advances on teleost fish oocyte differentiation, maturation and ovulation, including those involved in the degeneration and reabsorption of ovarian follicles (atresia).

A. scoparia has high seed yield (0.2 - 5.3 × 105 seeds m- 2) with very small size (0.02 mg), and is easily propagated by wind and buried into soils. In the natural vegetation of the hilly-gully environment, the soil seed bank was dominated by A. scoparia with a high seed density of 1 000 - 17 000 seed m- 2 in a 0 - 10 -cm soil layer [19]. While Leymus scalinus has a low ripening rate and regenerated by rhizome with a film distribution. The seeds from S. bungeana, having bur with elongated shape, had low seed loss rate. S. bungeana is the main dominant Gramineae species in the area with a higher cover (20 - 70 %) and higher occurrence. S. bungeana, S. bungeana + LD, A. gmelinii + S. bungeana, and A. giraldii + S. bungeana are the common communities in the area. Apart from seminal propagation, another <b>special</b> mode of <b>reproduction</b> for S. bungeana is by the bulbiet falling off the parent plant to develop a new plant [20]. The seeds of LD and BI had higher seed loss rate. In the eroded slopes, LD and BI have soil seed banks with a density of 50 - 300 seeds m- 2; however, the seed density can reach 300 - 1, 000 seeds m- 2 in silted areas [19]. LD also has a large root system and strong shooting ability. While BI is the dominant species of the perennial herb and subshrub community in the middle and late stages of vegetation restoration. The seeds of BI are small, and easily washed away by overland flow. Moreover, the viability of BI seedlings is low; BI seedlings are weak due to the competition among early subshrub species for limited environmental resources, and sporadically and filmily distributed in the hilly-gullied Loess plateau. Short rhizome generation is used by BI as an ecological adaption strategy. It was observed that BI mainly relies on clonal propagation to achieve population renewal in the natural meadow [21]. Thus, vegetative propagation also plays a very important role in vegetation development in the Loess Plateau region.|$|R
