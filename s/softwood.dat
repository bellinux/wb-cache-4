5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and plywood. The wood of conifers is known as <b>softwood</b> while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E
5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. X.cornui grows in <b>softwood</b> forests with Sphagnum moss. Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. X.fraxinophila produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. X.parvibulbosa, while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to X.setulipes, has a bitter or sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} less common Mycena flavescens, a species found in both hardwood and <b>softwood</b> forests on the floor among leaf or needle litter or grassland. M. flavescens typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of radish. M. peyerimhoffi, known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana, but has a yellow stem. M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a sweet taste.|$|E
50|$|The area is densely forested with <b>softwoods,</b> with {{spruce and}} balsam predominating above the 2,500-foot (762 m) level and mixed {{hardwoods}} and <b>softwoods</b> predominating {{at the lower}} elevations.|$|R
30|$|Although <b>softwoods</b> {{are more}} {{recalcitrant}} to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, improvements in tissue culture systems {{have allowed the}} production of transgenic <b>softwoods,</b> Pinus radiata [26], Pinus taeda [27, 28], and Picea abies [27]. As {{in the case of}} Populus and Eucalyptus plants, the introduction and overexpression of genes of commercial interest have also been demonstrated, e.g., production of salt-tolerant Pinus taeda [29]. A combination of the next-generation sequencing technology, multi-omics, and genetic engineering will also accelerate the molecular breeding of <b>softwoods</b> of commercial interest.|$|R
5000|$|Hardwoods have a {{more complex}} {{structure}} than <b>softwoods</b> and are often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating [...] "hardwoods" [...] from <b>softwoods</b> {{is the presence of}} pores, or vessels. The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of perforation plates (simple, scalariform, reticulate, foraminate), and structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings.|$|R
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, <b>softwood</b> cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and <b>softwood</b> sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes {{shows some}} {{similarities}} to X.cauticinalis. They share the amber-coloured hair towards {{the base of}} the stem and both grow on soil, as opposed to directly onto wood. Further, X.cauticinalis can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of X.setulipes (though these are mixed with the other shapes more typical of the genus). X.cauticinalis mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area {{at the top of the}} stem is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of X.setulipes. Furthermore, X.cauticinalis has a very bitter taste. X.setulipes shares with X.brunneola its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ in the shape of both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of X.brunneola measure between 2 and 3μm in width) and the fact it is found specifically in <b>softwood</b> woodland. Furthermore, the two do not appear to be closely related.|$|E

25|$|In {{chemical}} terms, {{the difference}} between hardwood and <b>softwood</b> {{is reflected in the}} composition of the constituent lignin. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol. <b>Softwood</b> lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to {{classify}} wood as either <b>softwood</b> or hardwood. The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called <b>softwood,</b> and the wood from dicotyledons (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial <b>softwood.</b> Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. yew) are harder than many hardwoods.|$|E

25|$|Bush's {{imposition}} of a tariff on imported steel and on Canadian <b>softwood</b> lumber was controversial {{in light of his}} advocacy of free market policies in other areas; this attracted criticism both from his fellow conservatives and from nations affected. The steel tariff was later rescinded under pressure from the World Trade Organization. A negotiated settlement to the <b>softwood</b> lumber dispute was reached in April 2006, and the historic seven-year deal was finalized on July 1, 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Softwood</b> plywood {{is usually}} made either of cedar, Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir (collectively known as {{spruce-pine-fir}} or SPF) or redwood and is typically used for construction and industrial purposes.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{timber frame}} joinery, mortises and tenons were typically two {{inches wide and}} two inches {{from the edge of}} the timber when working with <b>softwoods,</b> giving rise to the width of the blade. Likewise, mortises and tenons were traditionally one and a half inches wide when working in hardwoods, explaining the width of the tongue. This allowed for quick layouts of mortise and tenon joints when working both hard and <b>softwoods.</b>|$|R

25|$|Wood has a {{long history}} of being used as fuel, which {{continues}} to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over <b>softwood</b> because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.|$|E

25|$|In {{coniferous}} or <b>softwood</b> species {{the wood}} cells are mostly of one kind, tracheids, {{and as a}} result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods.
