2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A <b>scraper</b> <b>seal</b> was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35â€“50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head is fitted with seals {{to prevent the}} pressurized oil from leaking past the interface between the rod and the head. This area is called the seal gland. The advantage of a seal gland is easy removal and seal replacement. The seal gland contains a primary seal, a secondary seal / buffer seal, bearing elements, wiper / <b>scraper</b> and static <b>seal.</b> In some cases, especially in small hydraulic cylinders, the rod gland and the bearing elements are made from a single integral machined part.|$|R
2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also side exhaust ports, the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone <b>scraper</b> side <b>seal,</b> and approached the thermal distortion difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics. The Renesis is capable of [...] with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 1.3L displacement. However, this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their Wankel engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the improved Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a Wankel-powered vehicle. [...] The company is continuing development of the next generation of Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R with a new rear wheel drive sports car model announced in October 2015 although with no launch date given. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. [...] Mazda announced the introduction of the series-hybrid Mazda2 EV car using a Wankel engine as a range extender, however no date of introduction has been announced.|$|R
