25|$|On 19 June Frankel {{started at}} odds of 1/10 for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot against a field which {{included}} Excelebration and Strong Suit, respectively ranked the equal second and the equal fifth best three-year-old colts {{in the world}} by the IFHA in 2011. Frankel took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew steadily clear to win by eleven lengths from Excelebration. Frankel ran the penultimate furlong in a time of 10.58 seconds, which equates to a top speed of over 42mph. The Guardian's correspondent described the performance as possibly the greatest in the history of Thoroughbred racing. Timeform responded to the win by raising Frankel's provisional rating to 147, the highest in the organisation's history, two pounds in advance of the 145 recorded in 1965 by <b>Sea-Bird.</b> However the British Horseracing Authority's handicapper, Dominic Gardiner-Hill, was more cautious. He rated the horse at 140, which was still just behind Dancing Brave's all-time record mark of 141. The Racing Post gave the performance a rating of 142, the highest in the publication's history, three pounds ahead of Dubai Millennium.|$|E
2500|$|The royal {{standard}} of Gondor was {{an image of}} a white tree in blossom upon sable field, surrounded by seven five-rayed stars and surmounted by a winged crown. This combined references to several symbols of the realm: the White Tree was a unique plant brought by Isildur from Númenor, first planted in Minas Ithil and later three times replanted from seed at Minas Anor; the Crown of Gondor was in the beginning Isildur's war-helmet and later the main symbol of monarchy in the South-kingdom, with wings of a <b>sea-bird</b> being an emblem of the exiled Númenóreans; and the stars [...] "originally represented the single stars on the banners of each of seven ships [...] that bore a palantír". The palantíri were [...] "seeing-stones" [...] of Elendil, four of which were placed in strongholds of Gondor: Osgiliath, Minas Anor, Minas Ithil and Isengard—and were used by Kings or their servants for surveillance of the lands and communication both within the realm and with Arnor.|$|E
