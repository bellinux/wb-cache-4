5|$|Rupert {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean after she was {{commissioned}} and served there from 1876 to 1880. She was thereafter held in reserve at Portsmouth until being mobilised for the Particular Service Squadron during the Russian war scare from April to August 1885. She was then assigned as guard <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Hull until 1890. After reconstruction she became guard <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Pembroke Dock until 1895, then at Gibraltar between 1895 and 1902, then relieved Hotspur as guard <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Bermuda until her sale in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Achilles was recommissioned in 1901 as a depot <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Malta under a {{succession}} of different names. She was transferred to Chatham in 1914 and was again renamed multiple times before she was sold for scrap in 1923. Achilles had more changes of her rigging and armament than any other British warship, before or since.|$|E
5|$|After 1922, Mikasa was {{decommissioned}} {{in accordance}} with the Washington Naval Treaty and preserved as a museum <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Yokosuka. She was badly neglected during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s. She is now fully restored as a museum ship and can be visited at Mikasa Park in Yokosuka.|$|E
5|$|In March 1919, St Vincent {{was reduced}} to reserve and became a gunnery {{training}} <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Portsmouth. She then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December, when she was transferred to Rosyth. There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921; she was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921 and demolished.|$|E

5|$|These four {{conditions}} closely {{mirror the}} original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 {{laid out for}} the maintenance of Wisconsin while she was in the Mothball Fleet. It was unlikely that these conditions would impede a plan to turn Wisconsin into a permanent museum <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> her berth in Norfolk.|$|E
5|$|When {{firing the}} same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 {{had a slight}} {{advantage}} over the 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45cal gun would be slower, meaning {{that it would have}} a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45cal would strike a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> an angle of 45.2degrees, as opposed to 36degrees with the 50cal.|$|E
5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E

5|$|After sharing {{multiple}} stadia across Greater Manchester between 2005 and 2015, F.C. United {{opened their}} own ground, Broadhurst Park in north-east Manchester, in May 2015. The {{team has been}} managed by former professional footballer Karl Marginson since its formation. The club's regular kit colours are red shirts, white shorts and black socks. Their badge {{is based on the}} Manchester coat of arms and features a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> sea and three stripes for the three rivers that flow through Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E

5|$|Enraged by {{the defeat}} at the battle, Adolf Hitler ordered the {{majority}} of the surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged Admiral Hipper while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952; her bell resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.|$|E
5|$|From 1901 to 1909, Concord alternated between Alaskan patrols, {{cruising}} the Mexican coast, and periodic trips to China, serving {{for a time}} on the Yangtze Patrol. In November 1909, Concord was decommissioned at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. For the next five years, she served as a barracks ship for the Washington Naval Militia. In 1914, the former Concord {{was transferred to the}} Public Health Service and served as a quarantine <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Astoria, Oregon until 1929. After a brief return to Navy custody, the ship was sold in June 1929.|$|E
5|$|Illustrious was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet until 1904. Transferred to the Channel Fleet (which was subsequently reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) she underwent a refit which was duly completed in early 1906. Rendered obsolete by the emergence of the new dreadnoughts, she served with the Home Fleet from 1908. One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when World War I broke out, she served as a guard <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> various regions around Northern England until late 1915. Her main armament was removed and she then served as a store ship {{for the remainder of the}} war. She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} on a <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents. The tragedy caused {{more than five}} hundred deaths, more than four thousand injuries, and more than $50 million in damage ($ million in today's dollars). Though the city's growth and prosperity were interrupted, {{the city and the}} business leaders were able to rebuild.|$|E
5|$|In April 1795, the inshore {{squadron}} of the British blockade at Brest was commanded by Rear-Admiral John Colpoys, who had at his command five ships of the line: HMS London, HMS Valiant, HMS Colossus, HMS Hannibal and HMS Robust and frigates HMS Astraea and HMS Thalia. Colpoys' ships had formed an effective blockade: on 29 March {{they had taken}} the French corvette Jean Bart and the following day recaptured a lost British merchant <b>ship.</b> <b>At</b> 10:00 on 10 April, the British squadron was cruising off the approaches to Brest when three ships were spotted to the west.|$|E
5|$|In January 1923, {{the ship}} {{returned}} home {{and became a}} gunnery training <b>ship</b> <b>at</b> Devonport. She was relieved of that duty in November and King George V was reduced to reserve. She was then assigned to the training establishment HMS Impregnable. On 28 September 1926, the ship {{was taken out of}} service and was listed for disposal on 1 December to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. Later that month, King George V was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company and arrived at Rosyth on 27 January 1927 to be broken up.|$|E
