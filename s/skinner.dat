5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter <b>Skinner</b> (Mitch Pileggi) hold each other at gunpoint. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), the person lingering outside his apartment, bursts in and forces <b>Skinner</b> to put his gun down. He also demands that <b>Skinner</b> surrender the digital tape. <b>Skinner</b> insists on keeping the tape, saying it is their only leverage in exposing the conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee. The agents meet with <b>Skinner</b> at a diner in rural Maryland. <b>Skinner</b> wants {{to turn over}} the tape in exchange for their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let <b>Skinner</b> turn the tape over. <b>Skinner</b> heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. <b>Skinner</b> chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>Skinner</b> arrives home he is met by Mulder, {{who tells}} {{him about the}} case {{and the fact that}} someone is going to great lengths to cover it up. Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks <b>Skinner.</b> Mulder tells <b>Skinner</b> that Scully is {{undergoing}} tests regarding her cancer. Later that night <b>Skinner</b> meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man (Morris Panych). <b>Skinner</b> is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls <b>Skinner,</b> telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells <b>Skinner</b> that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued to a federal agent or local officer. <b>Skinner</b> searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must have been the one used for the murder. <b>Skinner,</b> realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police <b>Skinner</b> would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up.|$|E

25|$|Verbal Behavior had an uncharacteristically cool reception, {{partly as}} a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of <b>Skinner's</b> failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms. <b>Skinner's</b> peers may have been slow to adopt the ideas {{presented}} in Verbal Behavior because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked <b>Skinner's</b> experimental work. However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in <b>Skinner's</b> functional analysis of verbal behavior.|$|R

In addition, <b>Skinner</b> set 10 new single-season passing records at Wake Forest during the 2006 season.

5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by <b>Skinner,</b> the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by <b>Skinner</b> for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. The Chefs convince <b>Skinner</b> to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When <b>Skinner</b> catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>Skinner's</b> (1957) {{analysis of}} verbal {{behavior as a}} framework for understanding language acquisition in children with autism. We describe <b>Skinner's</b> analysis of pure and impure verbal operants and illustrate how this analysis may be applied to the design of communication training programs. The picture exchange communication system (PECS) is a training program influenced by <b>Skinner's</b> framework. We describe the training sequence associated with PECS and illustrate how this sequence may establish multiply controlled verbal behavior in children with autism. We conclude with an examination of how <b>Skinner's</b> framework may apply to other communication modalities and training strategies...|$|R

After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead.

Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking <b>Skinner</b> to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. <b>Skinner</b> tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for <b>Skinner</b> to pull his gun on her.|$|E

5|$|<b>Skinner</b> remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a bearded man {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme.

The case is closed and <b>Skinner</b> is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). The bearded man was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skinner</b> {{sees the}} old woman looking at him on a city street. However, when he pursues {{the old woman}}, he instead finds Sharon.

She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. <b>Skinner</b> returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that <b>Skinner</b> has been working against him all this time. <b>Skinner</b> is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so <b>Skinner</b> is not blamed for the murder. That night <b>Skinner</b> confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and <b>Skinner</b> leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>Skinner's</b> work on verbal {{behavior in}} the context of literature as a particular class of written verbal behavior. It looks at contemporary literary theory and analysis and the contributions that <b>Skinner's</b> theoretical framework can make. Two diverse examples of poetic literature are chosen and analyzed following <b>Skinner's</b> framework, examining the dynamic interplay between the writer and reader that take place within the bounds of the work presented. It is concluded that <b>Skinner's</b> hypotheses about verbal behavior and the functional approach to understanding it have much to offer literary theorists in their efforts to understand literary works and should be more carefully examined...|$|R
