5|$|Lethbridge's {{next project}} focused on {{searching for a}} chalk hill figure that was {{reported}} to have once existed on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. Towards the end of 1954 he began investigating the site, inserting metal rods into the ground to determine where he believed the turf had once been removed to expose the chalk below. He believed that he had revealed three large figures, a warrior, a hooded goddess, and a sun god, asserting them to be likely 3000 years old, and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures. Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery, reporting on it to The Times and being interviewed by the London Evening News. However, many archaeologists were sceptical of Lethbridge's methodology and the existence of the hill figures; they believed that the soft patches of chalk were the result of chalk <b>solifluction</b> and were only interpreted as human-made figures through Lethbridge's vivid imagination. The Council for British Archaeology brought together a committee to assess Lethbridge's findings, composed of I. W. Cornwall, W. F. Grimes, Christopher Hawkes, and Stuart Piggott. With the aid of geologist F. E. Zeuner, the committee concluded that the shapes Lethbridge had discovered were natural, having been formed during the last Ice Age. However, Hawkes disagreed with his colleagues, and believed that while not proven, Lethbridge's conclusions could not be disproved. Lethbridge stuck by his original ideas, and wrote a book aimed at a general audience, Gogmagog – The Buried Gods on the basis of them. It was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1957, but received no supportive reviews.|$|E
25|$|Ice and frost’s erosive {{activity}} and the periglacial environment {{on the surface of}} Kolata massif have led to <b>solifluction,</b> reaching the eluvian stratum.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of stone runs occur in England, most notably at the Stiperstones, Shropshire. They are also known in Pennsylvania. Small examples are probably very widespread where <b>solifluction</b> deposits contain large concentrations of frost-resistant rock blocks.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{concept of}} the origin of the Driftless Area is the pre-Illinoian {{continental}} glacial ice flowing over the Driftless Area and depositing on it pre-Illinoian till, which is more than 790,000 years old. When the ice retreated and uncovered the area, periglacial erosion removed it: Anticyclonic snow-bearing winds episodically dropped large amounts of snow, which then gradually removed superficial sediment by <b>solifluction</b> and snowmelt overland flow, so-called sheetwash.|$|E
500|$|Periglacial {{phenomena}} {{are observed}} on Llullaillaco, commencing at [...] altitude and reaching their maximum around [...] on the Chilean and [...] on the Argentine side. There, <b>solifluction</b> and cryoplanation surfaces are developed, including lobe-shaped ground and block ramparts. These landforms have been mapped on the northwestern {{side of the}} volcano. Patterned ground is also common. Permafrost is found at higher altitudes. Cryoplanation and <b>solifluction</b> landforms are also observed on Iris and Mitral. Other than on periglacially influenced terrain, the ground at Llullaillaco is formed mostly by lavic rocks and block debris, which are frequently buried by tephra.|$|E
500|$|The geology of Southcote {{includes}} the Reading Formation—rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay, silt and sand {{formed in the}} Palaeogene period. Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk, with geological surveys also finding flint samples. A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly Plastic Clay (now known as the Lambeth Group) and chalk north of the river, with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet. More specifically, the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel, including Winter Hill (variably clayey and sandy), Lynch Hill (sand and gravel with lenses of silt, clay or peat), and head (a polymict deposit usually formed by periglacial <b>solifluction</b> or gelifluction). The survey also identified {{that much of the}} land south of the Kennet is [...] "infilled" [...] or [...] "worked" [...] ground; this area was formerly gravel pits and now used for leisure. The British Geological Survey defines infilled ground as [...] "areas where the ground has been cut away then wholly or partially backfilled" [...] and worked ground as [...] "areas where the ground has been cut away such as quarries and road cuttings".|$|E
500|$|Intense {{glaciation}} {{has taken}} place at Level Mountain in the last 5.33 million years, {{as shown by the}} presence of strongly developed glacial grooves reaching elevations over [...] This evidence indicates that much of the massif was covered by ice during past glacial periods, with the latest glacial period ending approximately 12,000 years ago. A series of U-shaped valleys have been carved into the stratovolcano by radially directed alpine glaciers. These serve as a radial drainage for at least six small streams; Dudidontu, Kakuchuya, Beatty, Lost, Kaha and Little Tahltan. Those that flow from the Level Mountain Range drain across the lava plateau in a pinwheel-like fashion. Two streams, Kakuchuya and Dudidontu, contain a series of small lakes. The Kakuchuya and Beatty creek valleys have been eroded to a level below that of the plateau surface. Also dissecting the massif are V-shaped stream canyons along the lava plateau margin, exposing a section of Tertiary basalts along the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. Periglacial processes, such as cryoturbation and stone stripping, occur on Level Mountain at elevations greater than [...] Cryoturbation takes place mainly on flat and gently sloping areas while stone stripping happens primarily on gently sloping areas adjacent to peaks of the Level Mountain Range. Some of the steeper slopes of the Level Mountain Range are confined to nivation and <b>solifluction.</b> Snow avalanches are limited only to the Level Mountain Range and the steepest slopes.|$|E
2500|$|Stone runs are accumulations of {{boulders}} with no finer material between them. In the Falklands, {{they occur}} on slopes of between 1 and 10 degrees, {{and are the}} product of mass-movement and stone sorting during past periods of cold climate. They everywhere occur in association with poorly sorted, clay-rich <b>solifluction</b> deposits ...|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{formation}} of stone runs involved {{no less than}} five processes: weathering, <b>solifluction,</b> frost heaving, frost sorting, and washing. [...] The stone runs are essentially different from moraines, rock glaciers, and rock flows or other rock phenomena involving the actual flow of rock blocks under stress that is sufficient {{to break down the}} cement or to cause crushing of the angularities and points of the boulders. [...] By contrast, the stone run boulders are fixed quite stably, providing for safer climbing and crossing of the run.|$|E
2500|$|The Llanquihue {{glaciation}} {{takes its}} name from Llanquihue Lake in southern Chile which is a fan-shaped piedmont glacial lake. On the lake's western shores there are large moraine systems of which the innermost belong to the last glacial period. Llanquihue Lake's varves are a node point in southern Chile's varve geochronology. During the last glacial maximum the Patagonian Ice Sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S. The western part appears to have been very active, with wet basal conditions, while the eastern part was cold based. Cryogenic features like ice wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil cryoturbation, [...] <b>solifluction</b> deposits developed in unglaciated extra-Andean Patagonia during the Last Glaciation. However, not all these reported features have been verified. The area west of Llanquihue Lake was ice-free during the LGM, and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by Nothofagus. Valdivian temperate rainforest was reduced to scattered remnants in the western side of the Andes.|$|E
2500|$|Small glaciers {{developed}} in a few favorable places in Southern Africa during the last glacial period. These small glaciers would have {{developed in}} the Lesotho Highlands {{and parts of the}} Drakensberg. The development of glaciers was likely aided by localized cooling indebted to shading by adjacent cliffs. Various moraines and former glacier niches have been identified in the eastern Lesotho Highlands, above 3,000 m.a.s.l. and on south-facing slopes, a few kilometres west of the Great Escarpment. Studies suggest the mountains of Southern Africa were mostly subject to mild periglaciation during the last glacial cycle and the annual average temperatures were about 6° C colder than at present. The estimated 6° C temperature drop for Southern Africa is in line with temperature drops estimated for Tasmania and Southern Patagonia during the same time. The environment of the Lesotho Highlands during the Last Glacial Maximum was one of a relatively arid periglaciation without permafrost but with deep seasonal freezing on south-facing slopes. [...] Periglaciation in the Eastern Drakensberg and Lesotho Highlands produced <b>solifluction</b> deposits, blockfields and blockstreams, and stone garlands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solifluction</b> lobes {{and sheets}} are types of slope failure and landforms. In <b>solifluction</b> lobes sediments form a tongue-shaped feature due to {{differential}} downhill flow rates. In contrasts <b>solifluction</b> sheets sediment moves more-less uniformily downslope, being thus a less selective form of erosion than <b>solifluction</b> lobes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solifluction</b> lobes - <b>Solifluction</b> lobes {{are formed}} when {{waterlogged}} soil slips down a slope {{due to gravity}} forming U shaped lobes.|$|E
5000|$|Slow <b>solifluction</b> is acts {{much slower}} than some geochemical fluxes or than other erosion processes. [...] The {{relatively}} low rates at which <b>solifluction</b> operates contrast occurrence over wide mountain areas and periglaciated lowlands.

50|$|It was {{suggested}} that <b>solifluction</b> might be active on Mars, even relatively recently (within {{the last few}} millions years), as observed martian lobates bear many similarities with <b>solifluction</b> lobes known from Svalbard.|$|E
5000|$|Deposits of slow {{periglacial}} <b>solifluction</b> compromise poorly stratified diamicton and diamicton where stratification {{is wholly}} lacking. When stratification {{can be seen}} it is often distinguished by a buried organic soil. Some other <b>solifluction</b> deposits that have a more defined stratification consists of alternating layers of diamicton and open-work beds, these last representing buried stone-banked lobes and sheets. A common featurein <b>solifluction</b> deposits is the orientation of clasts parallel to the slope.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Solifluction</b> is a {{collective}} name for gradual mass wasting slope processes related to freeze-thaw activity. This {{is the standard}} modern meaning of <b>solifluction,</b> which differs from the original meaning given to it by Johan Gunnar Andersson in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} sense it meant {{the movement of}} waste saturated in water found in periglacial regions. However it was later discovered that various slow waste movements in periglacial regions did not required saturation in water, but were rather associated to freeze-thaw processes. The term <b>solifluction</b> was appropriated to refer to these slow processes, and therefore excludes rapid periglacial movements. In slow periglacial <b>solifluction</b> there are not clear gliding planes, an therefore skinflows and active layer detachments {{are not included in}} the concept.On the other hand, movement of waste saturated in water can occurs in any humid climate, and therefore this kind of <b>solifluction</b> is not restricted to cold climates.Slow periglacial <b>solifluction</b> is classified into four types: ...|$|E

50|$|A major {{process that}} forms {{stratified}} slope deposits in periglacial areas is <b>solifluction</b> of stone blankets {{in the form}} of <b>solifluction</b> lobes and sheets. Other processes include rock fall, flow of ice-coasted clasts, flow of dry grains, debris flow and snow avalanches. Other processes that contribute to the formation, but that are of lesser importance, include overland flow of water caused by rain and the combined action of snow and wind.|$|E
50|$|Where {{thermokarst}} depressions {{have formed}} by melting of the permafrost, they are filled by Holocene <b>solifluction</b> and lake sediments. These depressions formed {{as the result}} of the thawing of ice wedges and other permafrost during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition about 12,000 to 10,000 years ago. Lacustrine sediments filling these depressions contain a record of the Allerød warming, Younger Dryas cooling, and other climatic events. Holocene fluvial and <b>solifluction</b> deposits underlie valleys of streams cut into underlying Pleistocene sediments. <b>Solifluction</b> deposits, which were created by melting of the underlying permafrost, veneer the surface of the uplands. New ice wedge polygon systems later formed in these sediments during the Late Holocene as result of pronounced climatic cooling, which only recently has reversed in the last couple of hundred years.|$|E

50|$|Periglaciation {{results in}} a variety of ground {{conditions}} but especially those involving irregular, mixed deposits created by ice wedges, <b>solifluction,</b> gelifluction, frost creep and rockfalls. Periglacial environments trend towards stable geomorphologies.|$|E
50|$|Weathered {{particles}} are moved downslope by creep, <b>solifluction</b> and rill wash. Over time, {{this leads to}} the formation of nivation hollows which, when enlarged, can be the beginnings of a cirque.|$|E
