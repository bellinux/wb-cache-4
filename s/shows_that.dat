5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey.

The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh.

As corollaries, we <b>show</b> <b>that</b> several complexity classes {{are contained in}} PP. Results Comparing the power of various computational paradigms is a central concern of computational complexity theory. In this paper, we study the power of PP by asking whether it is closed downwards under polynomial-time parity reductions. Gill [5] <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> NP is contained in PP.
