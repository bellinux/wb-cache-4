5|$|The Civil Air Patrol {{owns and}} {{operates}} a fleet not to exceed 550 <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> predominantly Cessna 172 Skyhawk and Cessna 182 Skylane aircraft. The aircraft are in a phased refurbishment program which began in 2008, replacing engines, interior, avionics, and paint {{at a lower cost}} than new purchases.|$|E
5|$|Specht's {{personal}} emblems adorning his aircraft {{included a}} design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a chevron (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries. His <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross {{painted on the}} cowling after {{he was awarded the}} honour in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Retaining his {{interest}} in flying {{after the end of}} his active military career, Hess obtained his private pilot's licence on 4 April 1929. His instructor was World War I flying ace Theodor Croneiss. In 1930 Hess became the owner of a BFW M.23b monoplane sponsored by the party newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter. He acquired two more Messerschmitt aircraft in the early 1930s, logging many flying hours and becoming proficient in the operation of light <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

25|$|Visibility: Pilot {{visibility}} may be poorer due to {{the width}} of the engine on <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> although tight fitting cowlings helped reduce this factor somewhat. Equivalent inline engines often resulted in overly long noses, which similarly impaired visibility directly forward.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 1957, three F-100Cs set a {{new world}} {{distance}} record for <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> by covering the 6,710mi (5,835nmi, 10,805km) distance from London to Los Angeles in 14 hours and 4 minutes. The flight was accomplished using inflight refueling.|$|E
25|$|The Queensland {{government}} {{bought a}} <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> for the Premier's use in November 1971, upgrading it to a twin-engine aircraft in 1973 and even bigger model in 1975.

25|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Paalson's biplane designs, the Type 1 sporting single-seater {{and the six}} passenger Type 2, was a mechanism allowing the alteration of the position and angle of incidence of the upper wing. That apart, they were conventional <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> of their time, though the Type 1's Warren truss interplane struttage was uncommon.|$|E
25|$|The AgustaWestland AW119 Koala, {{produced}} by Leonardo since 2016, is an eight-seat utility helicopter {{powered by a}} single turboshaft engine produced for the civil market.

25|$|In 1967, {{piloting}} her own Aero Commander 200, {{she became}} the fourth woman to fly a <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the second to do it from New York City.

25|$|The {{aerospace}} program's training fleet {{is made up}} of Diamond DA40 <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> featuring glass cockpits, with {{an assortment}} of other single- and multi-engine aircraft available. In 2010, the Department of Aerospace purchased ten radar simulators as well as a one-of-a-kind 360 degree control tower simulator to enhance training for its air traffic control students. These simulators allow students to experience lifelike air traffic control scenarios that will aid in preparing them for training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|On 22-23 March 2017, the CS100 {{completed}} {{tests for}} the 5.5-degree approach in Wichita and Salina, Kansas. The CS100 was certified for the steep approach landing for London City in April 2017. Corporate aircraft {{such as the}} Beechcraft Super King Air, Cessna CitationJet series, Hawker 400, Hawker 800, Piaggio Avanti and variants of the Dassault Falcon business jets are increasingly common. The airport is not available for use by <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> or helicopters; recreational flights and single-pilot operations are also not permitted.|$|E
25|$|Students, {{players and}} staff wore ribbons {{with the number}} 4, and the coaches' {{initials}} in remembrance. Additionally, a memorial was set up inside Gallagher-Iba Arena bearing semblance to these ribbons in honor of Coach Budke and Coach Serna. Assistant coach Jim Littell was named interim head coach and team's following two games were canceled. Since the accident, the university expanded its rules prohibiting <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> travel to include coaches, staff and pilots, while rules {{were put in place}} to ensure all flight aircraft would be reviewed by a consultant.|$|E

25|$|The first Berkeley was {{accepted}} for trials at RAF Martlesham Heath in May 1925 and remained there until November. Other aircraft competing for production contracts were the Handley Page Handcross, the Hawker Horsley and the Westland Yeovil. The Handcross and the Berkeley {{were the two}} larger machines {{and for that reason}} judged more suitable for the night bombing role; unfortunately for Handley-Page and Bristol, the Air Ministry had already decided, on the basis of experience with the Avro Aldershot that <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> were not suitable for night-bombing. In the end, therefore the only successful contender was the Horsley, chosen for the day-bomber role.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Mooney Airplane Company of Kerrville, Texas, {{designed}} a six-seat pressurised light aircraft, {{powered by a}} single 360hp (268kW) piston engine, which they designated the Mooney 301. On 7 April 1983, the prototype 301 conducted its maiden flight. During 1985, the Mooney Aircraft Company was acquired by new French owners, who promptly {{took an interest in}} the further development of the fledgling 301. Coinciding with the company's acquisition, French light aircraft manufacturer SOCATA, who had identified a vacant market position for a purpose-built optimised <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> capable of fast personal transport and light cargo duties, identified the piston-powered 301 as a potential starting point to satisfy this niche.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey Aviation Company were keen {{to produce}} a design {{to meet the demands}} of Specification P.27/32 and {{commenced}} work upon such a design. The Belgian aeronautical engineer Marcel Lobelle served as the aircraft's principal designer. One of the early decisions made by Lobelle on the project was the use of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Merlin I engine, which had been selected due to its favourable power and compact frontal area. The Merlin engine was quickly paired to a de Havilland Propellers-built three-bladed variable-pitch propeller unit. The choice of engine enabled the designing of the aircraft to possess exceptionally clean lines and a subsequently generous speed performance. The resulting design was an all-metal <b>single-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which adopted a low-mounted cantilever monoplane wing and was equipped with a retractable tail wheel undercarriage.|$|E
