5|$|The other militia men {{traveled}} on land {{to find the}} place where the Margaretta was anchored and demanded surrender. After refusing to surrender, Moore sailed to where the Polly was anchored and attempted to recover her. There was an inconsequential exchange of gunfire with the militia men who were located on the shore, and Moore was able to raise anchor and travel to a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage.</b> The remaining men armed themselves with muskets, pitchforks, and axes to set out after the Margaretta.|$|E
25|$|The Bay of Islands {{offered a}} <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> {{and had a}} large Māori population. To attract ships, Māori began to supply food and timber. What Māori wanted was respect, plus firearms, alcohol, and other goods of European manufacture.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 December 1974, Booya was moored near Fort Hill wharf with four crew and one guest on board. As Cyclone Tracy {{approached}} Darwin, she – and all other vessels – were ordered off the wharves and instructed to find <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage.</b> Booya was last seen at about 8.00pm leaving Fort Hill wharf. For the next 29 years she remained missing, presumed sunk {{with the loss of}} all lives in the huge seas whipped up by Cyclone Tracy's 300km/h winds.|$|E
50|$|The south coast, {{dubbed the}} riviera, is {{somewhat}} more sheltered {{and there are}} several broad estuaries formed by drowned valleys or rias that offer <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> to seafarers, such as at Falmouth and Fowey. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of wave-cut platform.|$|R
50|$|As it was {{essential}} {{to move to a}} <b>safer</b> <b>anchorage,</b> Murray improvised an anchor by lashing two swivel guns together, which enabled Lady Nelson to sail into a more sheltered anchorage in Shoalwater Bay. The carpenter then went ashore in the boat to find an iron-bark tree with which to make a replacement anchor.|$|R
60|$|Monday {{afternoon}} the storm {{which had been}} beating up against the southeasterly wind nearly all day thickened, fold upon fold, in the northwest. The gale increased, and blackened the harbor and whitened the open sea beyond, where sail after sail appeared round the reef of Whaleback Light, and ran in a wild scamper for the <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> within.|$|R
25|$|The British {{troops and}} Royal Marines landed without {{alarming}} the batteries, which they stormed and carried. The {{rest of the}} squadron then stood into the bay and exchanged fire with the French frigate Caroline. Soon the batteries, town and shipping were all in British hands for the total loss of 22 killed, 76 wounded, and four missing. Boadicea, which {{had not been able}} to maintain the blockade, contributed Royal Marines to the attack, one of whom was killed and five of whom were wounded. The British had achieved their objectives, the capture of French shipping and the destruction of the defenses of the only <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> on the island. They then withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The first {{fire was}} opened {{two days earlier}} than planned, against Fort Mollinochesco. So heavy was the British {{bombardment}} that by 6 July the fort had been badly damaged. During that evening French work parties sought to repair some of the damage, but were dissuaded by feint attacks on the fort by detachments of Corsican regulars and troops from the Royal Irish Regiment. These operations forced French forward picquets to withdraw, allowing a new British battery to be erected close to the damaged fort. This battery rendered the fort indefensible and the French garrison withdrew into Calvi. With Fort Mollinochesco in British hands the bay {{was no longer a}} <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> for the French, and the frigates retired into Calvi harbour.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Portugal by Afonso III, royal surveys, or inquirições gerais (general inquiries), were made at his command to inspect titles of lands claimed by the nobility and clergy, determined that the population around Lisbon was dispersed throughout the lowlands, which were suitable for agriculture. Consequently, Belém was connected to the neighbouring city by a bridge at Alcântara. Belém's proximity to the River Tagus also encouraged the development of commercial activities in the small village of Aldeia do Restelo, which attracted mariners and other seafarers seeking <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> and protection from the winds when they entered the river. In the 14th century, Moors settled on and cultivated the surrounding lands, providing the city with produce; other Moors, both free and enslaved, worked in the fishing industry. Meanwhile, settlement in Restelo grew slowly towards Lisbon.|$|E
50|$|The community, {{originally}} {{settled in}} the early 19th century for its proximity to rich fishing grounds and <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages,</b> was once a thriving fishing village. The town of Ramea was incorporated in 1951. Since the cod moratorium of 1992, the isolated community has struggled to survive, having declined to about 50% of its peak population of 1,120 in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1575 Perestrelo was {{commissioned}} {{to chart the}} Southern African coastline from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Correntes, paying particular attention to <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages.</b> This assignment he carried out between 22 November 1575 and 28 January 1576, returning to Mozambique on 13 March 1576. His report includes 8 panoramas of the horizon viewed from sea, starting with Cape Agulhas.|$|R
50|$|Downings {{used to be}} a {{significant}} fishing port with a substantial herring fleet. Today, however, the economy survives on tourism, and only three crab boats make a traditional living from the sea. Situated as it is in Sheephaven Bay, one of the <b>safest</b> <b>anchorages</b> on the northwest Irish coast, Downings has begun to cater for international game fishermen, the northwest of Ireland being on the migration route of bluefin tuna and other game species.|$|R
25|$|The Jerónimos Monastery {{replaced}} the church formerly existing {{in the same}} place, which was dedicated to Santa Maria de Belém and where the monks of the military-religious Order of Christ provided assistance to seafarers in transit. The harbour of Praia do Restelo was an advantageous spot for mariners, with a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> and protection from the winds, sought after by ships entering {{the mouth of the}} Tagus. The existing structure was inaugurated on the orders of Manuel I (1469–1521) at the courts of Montemor o Velho in 1495, as a final resting-place for members of the House of Aviz, in his belief that an Iberian dynastic kingdom would rule after his death. In 1496, King Manuel petitioned the Holy See for permission to construct a monastery at the site. The Hermitage of Restelo (Ermida do Restelo), as the church was known, was already in disrepair when Vasco da Gama and his men spent the night in prayer there before departing on their expedition to the Orient in 1497.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a large}} {{build-up}} of Allied {{troops in}} Egypt during September 1941 and German intelligence (Abwehr) suspected {{that there was a}} troop carrier in the area bringing in additional troops. Two Heinkel He 111 aircraft of II Staffeln, Kampfgeschwader 26, Luftwaffe, were dispatched from Crete to find and destroy the troop carrier. This search failed but one of the bombers discovered the vessels moored in <b>Safe</b> <b>Anchorage</b> F. Targeting the largest ship, they dropped two bombs on the Thistlegorm, both of which struck hold 4 near the stern of the ship at 0130 on 6 October. The bomb and the explosion of some of the ammunition stored in hold 4 led to the sinking of the Thistlegorm with the loss of four sailors and five members of the Royal Navy gun crew. The survivors were picked up by HMS Carlisle. Captain Ellis was awarded the OBE for his actions following the explosion and a crewman, Angus McLeay, was awarded the George Medal and the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea for saving another crew member. Most of the cargo remained within the ship, the major exception being the steam locomotives from the deck cargo which were blown off to either side of the wreck.|$|E

50|$|In the Age of Sail, the Royal Navy {{would often}} {{establish}} shore facilities close to <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> where the fleet {{would be based}} in home waters. This was the case when, around 1567, a Royal Dockyard was established at Chatham, Kent, {{on the bank of}} the River Medway. At that time, HM Ships would often lay at anchor either within the river, on Chatham Reach or Gillingham Reach, or beyond it, around The Nore.|$|R
5000|$|South of As Sib, {{the coast}} changes character. For about 175 kilometers, from As Sib to Ras al Hadd, it is barren and bounded by cliffs almost its entire length; {{there is no}} {{cultivation}} and little habitation. Although the deep water off this coast renders navigation relatively easy, there are few natural harbors or <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages.</b> The two best are at Muscat and Matrah, where natural harbors facilitated the growth of cities centuries ago.|$|R
2500|$|The south coast, {{dubbed the}} [...] "Cornish Riviera", is more {{sheltered}} {{and there are}} several broad estuaries offering <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages,</b> such as at Falmouth and Fowey. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of wave-cut platform. Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of Polperro, {{at the mouth of the}} Pol River, and the fishing port of Looe on the River Looe are both popular with tourists.|$|R
500|$|The French plan at Bonchurch {{may have}} been to burn Wroxall and Appuldurcombe, capture and {{consolidate}} {{a position on the}} heights of St. Boniface Down, and then link up with another French landing near Sandown. [...] The area around Bonchurch was important because nearby Dunnose Point offered <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage,</b> and had a fresh water source.|$|E
500|$|On {{the fateful}} evening of November 10, 1975, McSorley {{reported}} {{he had never}} seen bigger seas in his life. Paquette, master of Wilfred Sykes, out in the same storm, said, [...] "I'll tell anyone that it was a monster sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there." [...] The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> until after 3:35p.m. on November 10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.|$|E
500|$|Jurien {{recognised}} {{immediately that}} his force was severely outnumbered and steered for the coast {{in search of}} a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage.</b> The best available was the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne, which had a small harbour protected by gun batteries. At 09:10 Amelia was in range to fire on Cybèles stern before the British frigate dropped back to join Stopford's rapidly advcing force. The French then anchored under the batteries of the town with [...] "springs" [...] on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed the ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary.|$|E
50|$|One of the Royal Navy's major tasks, is the {{protection}} of shipping and the R.N.X.S played a non-combatant, but important role in support of its parent Navy by manning Port headquarters in major ports and anchorages around the United Kingdom. {{they were to be}} available to assist in the tasks, of evacuating major ports, and dispatching larger and faster merchant vessels overseas in case of an attack on the UK. Any remaining ships were to be dispatched to <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> along the coasts or at nearby islands.|$|R
50|$|Gizhigin Bay is entered between Cape Aregichinsky (60°30' N, 155°27' E) and Cape Taygonos (60°34' N, 160°11' E). The Taygonos Peninsula {{separates}} it from Penzhina Bay to the east. It {{is about}} 260 km (about 160 mi) {{west to east}} by 148 km (about 92 mi) north to south and has a maximum depth of 88 m (about 289 ft). The coast is steep and rocky {{and there are no}} completely <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> within the bay. The Gizhiga River is about 145 km (about 90 mi) long and flows into the head of the bay.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s the {{restoration}} of the oak woodland surrounding Salen began and the area was proposed as a Special Area of Conservation. There are many local walks where evidence of human activity going back to the Stone Age can be found. Salen has for centuries been one of Loch Sunart's <b>safest</b> <b>anchorages.</b> The stone pier was built when Salen {{was one of the main}} ports in the 19th century visited by steamers and other vessels. In 2011 the facilities at the pier were enhanced with a nine berth pontoon.|$|R
500|$|Shortly after 3:30p.m., Captain McSorley radioed Anderson {{to report}} that Fitzgerald was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing. The vessel had also {{developed}} a list. Two of Fitzgeralds six bilge pumps ran continuously to discharge shipped water. McSorley {{said that he would}} slow his ship down so that Anderson could close the gap between them. In a broadcast shortly afterward, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) warned all shipping that the Soo Locks had been closed and they should seek <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage.</b> Shortly after 4:10p.m., McSorley called Anderson again to report a radar failure and asked Anderson to keep track of them. Fitzgerald, effectively blind, slowed to let Anderson come within a [...] range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{as serious}} however were the legal ramifications of the battle. In both {{countries}} {{there was a}} storm of controversy; in France four captains faced courts-martial from 21 June on charges of having abandoned their ships too easily and failing to follow orders. The captain of Tonnerre was acquitted, the captain of Indienne was acquitted on the first charge but sentenced to three months house arrest for the second and the captain of Tourville was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison and to be dismissed the Navy for abandoning his ship prematurely. The captain of Calcutta, Jean-Baptiste Lafon, was convicted of abandoning his ship {{in the face of the}} enemy and sentenced to death on 8 September. The execution was carried out by firing squad on the deck of Océan the following day. Woodman considers that [...] "these wretched officers paid the penalty for Willaumez's initial timidity." [...] Allemand's defeat is often blamed on Napoleon's instructions before the battle, which mistakenly assumed that the Aix Roads were a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage.</b>|$|E

Departing London in March 1827 they sailed to Spitsbergen where they found a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> at Sorgfjord, Ny-Friesland in the far north. Abernethy participated in the expedition north but, beset by difficulties they turned back at 82° 45' N – a record [...] for furthest north that stood for almost fifty years. On the expedition's return Abernethy was enlisted in the Royal Navy on a permanent basis and eventually received his second Arctic Medal.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, {{the ship}} was again in danger from a large mass of burning oil that was moving across the harbor. The Empress could not steer because of the damaged propeller, but was able to avoid the oil fire {{long enough to get}} {{assistance}} from the tanker Iris. Her captain agreed to tow the bow of Empress of Australia around, and she was then able to move out to sea and a <b>safer</b> <b>anchorage.</b> When taking a count on Sunday, there were over 2000 refugees on board.|$|R
5000|$|In July Revenge {{returned}} to Okinawa, but soon departed {{with a small}} minesweeping group for the East China Sea. Then, on 27 August, Revenge went alongside [...] to take aboard a Japanese pilot for the sweep of Tokyo Bay. The next morning Revenge led the group into Tokyo Bay. There was a fairly wide channel, and <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages</b> were quickly charted {{for the rest of}} the fleet. The minesweepers then shifted operations to the coastline. After a month of such operations and some additional time in Tokyo Bay, the minesweepers were ordered to Sasebo.|$|R
50|$|Between 1772 and 1775 He {{accompanied}} Captain John Jervis to Russia {{where they}} {{spent time in}} St. Petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at Kronstadt and took {{a tour of the}} yacht designed by Sir Charles Knowles for Catherine the Great. The pair continued on to Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. All the while Jervis and Barrington made notes on defences, harbour charts and <b>safe</b> <b>anchorages.</b> They came home via the Netherlands, the two once again making extensive studies of the area and took copious notes describing any useful information. In 1778 Barrington became commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station.|$|R
2500|$|Due to German and Italian naval and {{air force}} {{activity}} in the Mediterranean, the Thistlegorm sailed {{as part of a}} convoy via Cape Town, South Africa, where she refuelled, before heading north up the East coast of Africa and into the Red Sea. On leaving Cape Town, the light cruiser [...] joined the convoy. Due to a collision in the Suez Canal, the convoy could not transit through the canal to reach the port of Alexandria and instead moored at <b>Safe</b> <b>Anchorage</b> F, in September 1941 where she remained at anchor until her sinking on 6 October 1941. HMS Carlisle moored in the same anchorage.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times {{it sounded as if}} the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. of the next day the hull cracked, the space between inner and outer bottoms was flooded, and Vogak rushed his ship to a <b>safe</b> <b>anchorage</b> in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|E

50|$|By 1795 he was {{in command}} of HMS Courageux, and took part {{with her in the}} Battle of Hyères. He was not aboard in December 1796 when the vessel was wrecked after an {{incident}} in the Bay of Gibraltar during bad weather. Her mooring cable parted and she was driven within range of Spanish shore batteries; Hallowell, ashore to sit at a court-martial, was denied permission to rejoin the ship and take her to safety. She was subsequently wrecked off Monte Hacho in high winds during her officers' attempts to move to a <b>safer</b> <b>anchorage,</b> with the loss of almost 500 lives.|$|R
50|$|The Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, is {{the name}} of a cargo ship wrecked in 1606 {{at the mouth of the}} River Tagus, near Lisbon, and {{subsequently}} excavated between 1996 and 2001. The ship had been seeking <b>safer</b> <b>anchorage</b> in the Tagus during strong winds, but she struck a submerged rock and went down close to shore with no loss of life. The wreck is so called because its major cargo at the time was peppercorns of black pepper, Piper nigrum, which carpeted the river and were harvested along with the fittings and other cargo by the population.|$|R
50|$|Community {{lobbying}} for a jetty commenced in 1879: the people believed that deep {{water in the}} bay would provide <b>safer</b> <b>anchorage</b> than other nearby locations. Eventually in 1882 construction of a jetty was undertaken by Frank George. Originally 155 metres long, it provided a depth of 2.1 metres at low tide. When lime burning became an established industry at Wool Bay the jetty was extended by a further 18 metres in anticipation of increased use. During this time, a steamship service dropped off and picked up provisions three times a week. When bulk-handling of grain was introduced at Port Giles in 1970, Wool Bay's importance as a port dwindled.|$|R
