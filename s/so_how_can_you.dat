2500|$|Three days later, Zhou Yu brought Jiang Gan {{on a tour}} of his camp, {{including}} his granaries and armouries. After that, Zhou Yu invited Jiang Gan to a feast. He instructed the servants to bring out some expensive items to show Jiang Gan. He told Jiang Gan, [...] "In his life, when a man meets a lord who truly appreciates him, he should fulfil his duty as a subject and forge a close relationship with his lord. He should follow his lord's orders faithfully and share weal and woe together with his lord. Even if Su Qin, Zhang Yi and Li Yiji were to return from the dead, they won't be able to affect his loyalty towards his lord. <b>So,</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> ever hope to make someone switch his allegiance?" [...] Jiang Gan laughed but did not respond to what Zhou Yu said.|$|E
2500|$|For his {{achievements}} in {{the conquest of}} Jing Province, Lü Meng was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Nan Commandery. He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Chanling (孱陵侯) and awarded 100 million coins and 500 jin of gold. Earlier on, Sun Quan threw a feast at Gong'an County to celebrate the victory, but Lü Meng {{did not want to}} attend because he was ill. Sun Quan laughed and said, [...] "Ziming, you deserve the honour of capturing Guan Yu. You've achieved victory but haven't received any reward yet, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> leave now?" [...] He ordered the soldiers to play music, and personally selected subordinates for Lü Meng and the equipment required for the ceremony. After the ceremony, all the soldiers lined up along the path when Lü Meng took his leave, with music playing in the background. That was Lü Meng's finest hour.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the Bogd Khaan era, the {{positions}} of the governments of China and Russia were clear and consistent. China was adamant that Mongolia was, and must remain, an integral part of China. The (provisional) constitution of the new Chinese republic contained an uncompromising statement to this effect. A law dealing with the election of the Chinese National Assembly provided for delegates from Outer Mongolia. For their part, the Russian Imperial government accepted the principle that Mongolia must remain formally part of China; however, Russia was equally determined that Mongolia possess autonomous powers so substantial as to make it quasi-independent. Thus, in 1912 Russia concluded a secret convention with the Empire of Japan delineating their respective spheres of influence: South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia fell to the Japanese, North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to the Russians. Bogd Khaan said to Yuan Shikai, the President of the Republic of China [...] "I established our own state before you, Mongols and Chinese have different origins, our languages and scripts are different. You're not the Manchu's descendants, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> think China is the Manchu's successor?".|$|E

2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> say it glorifies war?...

If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E

These {{should have been}} the chief figures of 'Mansfield Park.' But you timidly decline to tackle Passion. 'Let other pens,' you write, 'dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can.' Ah, there is the secret of your failure! Need I add that the vulgarity and narrowness of the social circles you describe impair your popularity? I scarce remember more than one lady of title, and but very few lords (and these unessential) in all your tales. Now, when we all wish to be in society, we demand plenty of titles in our novels, at any rate, and we get lords (and very queer lords) even from Republican authors, born in a country which in your time was not renowned for its literature. I have heard a critic remark, with a decided air of fashion, on the brevity of the notice which your characters give each other when they offer invitations to dinner. 'An invitation to dinner next day was despatched,' and this demonstrates that your acquaintance 'went out' very little, and had but few engagements. How vulgar, too, is one of your heroines, who bids Mr. Darcy 'keep his breath to cool his porridge.' I blush for Elizabeth! It were superfluous to add that your characters are debased by being invariably mere members of the Church of England as by law established. The Dissenting enthusiast, the open soul that glides from Esoteric Buddhism to the Salvation Army, and from the Higher Pantheism to the Higher Paganism, we look for in vain among your studies of character.

40|$|In {{the world}} today {{there are many ways}} in which we measure, count and {{determine}} whether something is worth the effort or not. In Australia and many other countries, new government legislation is requiring government-funded entities to become more transparent in their practice and to develop a more cohesive narrative about the worth, or impact, for the betterment of society. This places the executives of such entities in a position of needing evaluative thinking and practice to guide how they may build the narrative that documents and demonstrates this type of impact. In thinking about where to start, executives, project and program managers may consider this workshop as a professional development opportunity to explore both the intended and unintended consequences of performance models as tools of evaluation. This workshop will offer participants an opportunity to unpack the place of performance models as an evaluative tool through the following: · What shape does an ethical, sound and valid performance measure for an organization or personnel take? · What role does cultural specificity play in the design and development of a performance model for an organization or for personnel? · How are stakeholders able to identify risk during the design and development of such models? · When and where will dissemination strategies be required? · And <b>so</b> what? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> determine that your performance model implementation has made a difference now or in the future...|$|R

I say that from your infancy your faces haunted me. Ay, and when you had turned childhood's corner and once I met the pair of you walking hand in hand, then of a sudden I knew that it was you two and no others whom that god or devil had showed to me standing by the open grave upon the banks of Blythe. I knew it of Dick the Archer also, and can I be mistaken of such a man as that who has no fellow in England? But you think I dreamed it all, and perhaps I should not have spoken, though something made me speak. Well, in a day to come you may change your mind, since whatever dangers threaten you will not die yet, Hugh. Tell me now, what is this Frenchman like who would marry Eve?
