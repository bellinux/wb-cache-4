25|$|During 2008, {{a rolling}} {{programme}} of transmitter updates caused approximately 250,000 <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{to stop working}} altogether. Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of the}} update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network Information Table (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal chip set. Affected consumers were advised to buy new <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{the cable}} {{television}} networks transition from a broadcast-only network, to a high-bandwidth two-way network, the importance and functionality of the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> increases. However, developments in the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> industry have been restrained by the control the cable companies have over their equipment. Currently, a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> includes closed, proprietary technology which prohibits its use on other cable systems' networks. This paper explores the possibility of abandoning closed, proprietary <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> standards in favor of open standards. This "opening" of the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is not a trivial matter since it challenges cable companies' concerns about security, quality, etc. The paper includes a policy analysis of the impact the Cable Act of 1984 and 1992 and the implications it had on the <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b> To help quantify the benefits of open systems for cable television, economic analysis on <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> costs is included. Finally, {{the role of the}} set-top in the emerging National Information Infrastructure (NII) is explored...|$|R
