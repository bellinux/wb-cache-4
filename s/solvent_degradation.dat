Aqueous solvent is degraded by cycling in a combined absorber and stripper setup with realistic temperatures and CO 2 loadings of the solvent {{in addition to}} a defined synthetic flue gas mixture. A 14 week test campaign with degradation of 30 wt. % 2 -ethanolamine (MEA) was performed in the rig. Comparison between group methodology and specific nitrosamine analysis of the solvent showed that 42 % of the nitrosamines were unidentified species. This indicates that many of the MEA degradation products are likely precursors for nitrosamine formation. Two nitrosamines were identified in the solvent; nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and the nitrosamine of the degradation product N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -glycine (HEGly) : nitroso-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -glycine (NHEGly). 56 % of the total nitrosamine was identified as NHEGly, while 2 % was NDELA. Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was detected in the absorber gas emission, but was below the quantification limit in the solvent. Results indicate that the degradation of nitrosamines and nitramine in the solvent is highly temperature dependent, and that the levels of total nitrosamines and MEA-nitramine are significantly reduced by elevated stripper temperature. The results show that the SDR results give a realistic picture on the <b>solvent</b> <b>degradation</b> to be expected in a real CO 2 capture plant; degradation products formed in the SDR MEA solvent reflects those previously found in pilot plant studies.

The purpose of the tests was to evaluate {{which of the two}} substrates was capable to provide optimal operative conditions for chlorinated <b>solvents</b> <b>degradations.</b> The effect of the addition of yield extract was also evaluated. Eight digesters were operated along two months at the site conditions: at selected time intervals they were sampled and the nitrate, sulphate, iron ad manganese content were determined, together with the main physical-chemical parameters. At the same time, the evolution of gas composition in the head space was determined. Results indicate that the overall pathway of the process involved the initial denitrification, followed by sulfate reduction and methane production, that occurred almost simultaneously. The process was faster when using milk serum rather than sucrose as electron donor, though, in the tests when the milk serum was in the larger excess, a faster pH lowering caused a partial inhibition of methanogenic bacteria activity, thus retarding the beginning of methane production. In the reactors fed with milk serum and with an excess of electron donor with respect to the total chlorinated organics of 5 : 1 and 20 : 1, methanogenesis started after 17 - 20 days of incubation. Mass balances performed in both liquid and gaseous phase {{at the end of the}} experiments showed that a total removal of up to about 60 % of the total chlorinated organics was achieved in the liquid phase.

40|$|Background: Poly {{chlorinated}} biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} chlorinated organic chemicals that do not easily degrade in the environment. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of microwave rays, hydrogen peroxide, dioxide titanium and ethanol <b>solvent</b> on the <b>degradation</b> of PCBs. Methods: A 900 w domestic MW oven with a fixed frequency of 2450 MHZ was used to provide MW irradiation. Ray powers were used in 540, 720, and 900 w. A hole was made on the top portion of the oven and a Pyrex vessel reactor (250 ml volume) was connected to condensing system with a Pyrex tube connector. The PCBs were analyzed by GC-ECD. Results: The degradation of total PCBs was 54. 62...|$|R
