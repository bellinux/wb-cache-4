Bryant then went onto one of the coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 208, {{when the}} warlord Cao Cao wanted to recruit him {{to serve in}} the government, Sima Yi lied that he {{suffered}} from paralysis and stayed at home. One day, while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so he immediately rushed out to collect his books. One of his maids <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> Zhang Chunhua was worried that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her. She then personally prepared meals for the family. Sima Yi was very impressed with her.|$|E
25|$|Before {{night on}} Friday 18 May 1291, Acre, {{after being in}} the hands of the Franks for 100 years, was {{in the hands of}} Al-Ashraf Khalil and his army after a siege of 43 days, with the {{exception}} of the huge headquarters of the Templars which stood on the west side of the city seashore. After a week, Al-Asraf Khalil negotiated with Peter de Severy, who was in charge of the Templars, and it was agreed that the Templars and everyone inside the fortress would have free passage to Cyprus, but the Sultan's men who were sent to the fortress to supervise the evacuation started to round up the women and boys to send to the slave markets and were massacred by the Templars. Under the cover of darkness, Thibaud Gaudin, the new Master of the Temple, left the fortress for Sidon with a few people and the fortune of the Templars. In the morning, Peter de Severy went to the Sultan to settle a new negotiation but he was arrested with his followers and they were executed in retaliation for the Sultan's men who were massacred earlier by the Templars inside the fortress. When the besieged Templars in the fortress <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Peter de Severy, they continued the fight. On 28 May, after a wide breach was made under the fortress, the Sultan sent about 200 men to take it. The Frankish fortress collapsed, killing nearly everyone inside. All the Templars were killed, and about half of the Sultan's men were killed.|$|E

500|$|Romney visited Warren in July 1970, {{where he}} {{addressed}} leaders {{from it and}} around 40 nearby suburbs. He emphasized {{that the government was}} encouraging affirmative action rather than forced integration, but the local populace saw little difference and Romney was jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place. [...] Nixon <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Warren and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general, remarking to domestic adviser John Ehrlichman that, [...] "This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education." [...] The Open Communities policy conflicted with Nixon's use of the Southern strategy of gaining political support among traditionally white southern Democrats, and his own views on race. [...] Romney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E

2500|$|Freeman Dyson, a British (and later American) {{physicist}} who {{had worked}} as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 {{to the end of the}} war, wrote in later years: [...] "For many years I had intended to write a book on the bombing. Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true." [...] Dyson later goes on to say: [...] "Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all".|$|E
2500|$|Heartbroken and angry, Jason gets {{drunk and}} sleeps with Elizabeth Spencer (Rebecca Herbst). Elizabeth becomes pregnant, {{and the baby}} was {{initially}} {{believed to be the}} child of her husband, Lucky (then Greg Vaughan). Sam and Jason are able to reconcile and work through their issues. When Sam is framed by Ric, she and Jason go on the run and clear Sam's name, with the help of Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson). Jason learns that he is the father of Elizabeth's son, Jake Spencer, but they decide not to tell Sam or Lucky, who still thinks the baby is his. But Sam learns about Jake's paternity and becomes hurt, angry and jealous. Sam witnesses Jake being kidnapped and does not intervene; Jason later rescues Jake from his kidnapper, who tells him that Sam <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> Sam visits Jason in prison and breaks up with him, citing his lies and emotional unfaithfulness as her reasons. When Jason starts a relationship with Elizabeth, Sam, devastated and angry, hires actors to scare Elizabeth and her sons at gunpoint to remind her that Jason's enemies are everywhere. [...] However, Jason traces the goons back to Sam; confronting her in her own home, Jason openly threatens to kill Sam if she tries anything against Elizabeth's family again. Despite the severity of Sam's actions, the break up was received with mixed reviews. Monaco explains to Soap Opera Digest in a 2008 interview, [...] "I feel Sam and Jason was so abruptly ended without any explanation, really, as to the coldness that was so one-sided [...] Of course, Jake came into play, but I felt like Jason and Sam were always strong enough to overcome. Who knows [...] down the line?" ...|$|E

Mr. Coyote and Mr. Fox, whose heads were not held so high, saw her in time to put their tails between their legs and slink away.

This whole conception of charity is a crime against civilization--I had to have that pointed out to me, too,--this system of legalized or semi-legalized robbery and the distribution of largesse to the victims. The Church is doing wrong, is stultifying herself in encouraging it. She should set her face rigidly against it, stand for morality and justice and Christianity in government, not for pauperizing. It is her mission to enlighten these people, all people--to make them self-respecting, to give them some notion of the dignity of their souls and their rights before God and man." ...|$|E
