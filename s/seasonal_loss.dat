40|$|Day {{length is}} the primary cue used by many mammals to {{restrict}} reproduction to favourable spring and summer months, but it is unknown for any mammal whether the <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of fertility begins {{at the same time}} and occurs at the same rate in females and males; nor it established whether the termination of mating behaviour in males and females coincides with the loss of fertility. We speculated that females, owing to their greater energetic investment in reproduction, are the limiting sex in terminating offspring production in short days (SDs). Oestrous cycles and production of young were monitored in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) transferred from long days (LDs) to SDs. Females were mated to LD males after three to eight weeks of SD treatment; in a parallel experiment, males housed in SDs were mated to LD females. After five and eight weeks in SDs, at least twice as many males as females were fertile. Both males and females continued to copulate for several weeks after becoming infertile. The onset of seasonal infertility occurs earlier in females than males and the decline in fertility precedes the <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of mating behaviour in both sexes...|$|E

Here we report on results obtained for three freshwater macrophyte species (Callitriche obtusangula, Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton perfoliatus). We collected plants from the field at monthly intervals and measured photosynthetic and respiratory temperature-response curves. Fitted and calculated parameters were derived from the curves and a simple model {{was used to evaluate}} the acclimative capacity to seasonal variation in water temperature. For all species, optimum temperatures for gross photosynthesis showed little temporal variation. In addition, the shape of the temperature-response curves at suboptimal temperature was not optimized to temporal differences in water temperature. The only consistent seasonal trend in gas exchange was a gradual decrease in photosynthetic and respiratory capacity over time. Our measurements and model predictions did not point to an acclimative seasonal response in the thermal dependence of oxygen exchange. Hence, we conclude that either other processes constrain the plants' response, or temporal variation in water temperature is less important than <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of photosynthetic capacity.

40|$|A {{combination}} of high input management systems, high annual rainfall and deep, permeable soils in northern Tasmania create {{conditions that are}} conducive to high drainage and nitrogen losses below the root zone. An understanding of the extent and mechanism of such losses will enable farm managers and their consultants to identify and implement more sustainable management practices that minimise potential adverse financial and environmental consequences. Analysing the fate of water and nutrients in farming systems is complex and influenced by {{a wide range of}} factors including management, soil characteristics, seasonal climate variability and management history of the paddock/farm in question. This paper describes a novel farm system modelling approach based on the model APSIM, for analysing the fate of nitrogen and water in mixed vegetable-based farming enterprises. The study was based on seven case farms across the Panatana catchment in northern Tasmania. Substantial simulated drainage losses (> 100 Â mm average <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss)</b> were apparent for all crop and rotation elements across all farms in response to the surplus between crop water supply and crop water use. Crop nitrogen demand was found to be close to crop nitrogen supply for all crop and pasture rotation elements with the exception of potato, which had an average surplus nitrogen supply of 89 Â kgÂ N/ha. This resulted in potato having much higher nitrate nitrogen leaching losses (32 Â kgÂ N/ha) compared to other crops (APSIM Leaching Drainage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{document}} provides decision-makers and {{the public}} with {{an evaluation of the}} environmental, social, and economic effects of alternatives and options to manage the fishery resources in the Arctic Management Area. No large fisheries exist in the Arctic Management Area. However, the warming of the Arctic and <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of sea ice may increase opportunities for fishing in this region. The Council proposes to develop an Arctic Fishery Management Plan that would (1) close the Arctic to commercial fishing so that unregulated fishing does not occur and until information improves so that fishing can be conducted sustainably and with due concern to other ecosystem components; (2) determine the fishery management authorities in the Arctic and provide the Council with a vehicle for addressing future management issues; and (3) implement an ecosystem-based management policy that recognizes the resources of the U. S. Arctic and the potential for fishery development that might affect those resources, particularly {{in the face of a}} changing climate. This document addresses the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, Presidential Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Recent publications have pointed to a correlation between enhanced agricultural activities and increasing prevalence of the disease. This paper therefore {{examined the relationship between}} food crop production and incidence of malaria in the Ejisu-Juaben Municipality of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Ninety-two percent of sampled respondents had reported malaria cases in the 2010 major season. Out of these reported cases, 53. 3 % were female farmers. Chi-square tests of independence showed statistically significant association between education and measures adopted to control malaria. Self – medication was observed among respondents in the face of malaria symptoms. During periods of malaria incapacitation, 90. 2 % of affected farmers refrained from farm work. This threatened household food security and resulted in reduction in farm revenue. Average <b>seasonal</b> <b>losses</b> attributable to malaria incidence was estimated at GH¢ 126 ($ 66. 67).

These variations can have consequences for the overall primary productivity of the salt marsh system, {{as well as its}} ability to provide essential ecosystem functions. In this study, I explored factors that could be driving observed variations in four tidal creeks of the Plum Island Sound Estuary, Massachusetts. End of season stem densities were measured at two of the creeks over eight years. Seasonal stem densities were measured at all four of the creeks four times during a single growing season. My objectives were to assess the influence of temperature, precipitation, tide level, and solar radiation on stem density variations among years, and to determine whether <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of stems was due to self-thinning or tidal action. Years with higher precipitation were associated with higher densities (p = 0. 001), which may be due to an alleviation of salt stress in those years. Patterns of seasonal stem loss were more consistent with patterns of self-thinning, which has not been previously considered for S. alterniflora, than tidal action, which has been the predominant assumption. However, self-thinning and tidal action may be working in conjunction to cause seasonal stem loss. These results increase our ability to estimate S. alterniflora productivity, and our understanding of the species’ ecology and its responses to current and future climatological events...|$|E
40|$|Eucalypt saplings {{in north}} Australian savannas {{commonly}} die back, sometimes to ground level, during the 5 {{months of the}} long dry season. Water potentials are lower in saplings than large trees during the dry season, and we hypothesized that low water potentials may lead {{to high levels of}} xylem embolism and consequent death of branches and whole shoots. As the dry season progressed, hydraulic conductance of terminal branches decreased by 50 % in Eucalyptus tetrodonta but not in Eucalyptus miniata saplings. Hydraulic conductance per leaf area decreased seasonally by 34 % in E. tetrodonta branches. These decreases may be associated with the loss of leaves recorded from E. tetrodonta but not E. miniata branches. We modelled the effect of sequential loss of parallel resistors, representing petioles on a branch. This showed there is a non-linear decrease in flow as basal resistors are lost, which can lead to a decrease in mean flow per resistor due to increased mean path-length. Thus the observed loss of basal leaves, together with xylem embolism, probably contributed to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of hydraulic conductance in E. tetrodonta saplings. Loss of hydraulic conductance due to xylem embolism was generally low (< 15 %) in both species, and the seasonal increase in embolism could not fully account for the decline in hydraulic conductance of E. tetrodonta branches. There was little evidence that branch and shoot death was caused by these levels of embolism. Developing an embolism vulnerability curve for species with long vessels is problematic and this issue is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Plumage {{coloration}} {{has provided}} important model systems {{for research on}} signal expression. Whilst it had previously been assumed that moulting provided the only mechanism to change plumage coloration, {{recent studies have shown}} plumage colours to be seasonally dynamic, with implications both for the quantification of expression and for any signalling role. However, the mechanistic processes underlying such change remain uncertain. Here, we describe within-moult shifts in expression of a carotenoid-based colour trait - the yellow ventral plumage of the great tit Parus major - over a nine-month timespan. We report that plumage chromaticity ('colour') - but not achromaticity ('brightness') - exhibits a marked seasonal decline, independent of sex, age or body condition, and at a constant rate across twelve environmentally heterogeneous plots within our study site. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying this change we employed a spectral reconstruction approach, that generates predicted spectra for any timepoint within the sampling period. By comparing spectra for both early and late in the moult we show that the seasonal decline in chromaticity is driven by both a marked reduction in ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and, to a lesser extent, loss of active carotenoid pigments. Thus, our study shows that <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of chromaticity in the great tit is driven by altered reflectance primarily in the UV section of the spectrum, a finding made possible by the use of spectral compartmentalisation and multi-parallel modelling to produce reconstructed spectra. Whether change in plumage coloration influences signal function will depend on the dynamics of the signalling system but it could clearly inflate patterns such as assortative mating and should be considered in studies of colour expression. © 2012 The Authors...|$|E

Yet, previous research suggests that large Daphnia do not always dominate {{in the absence of}} predation.

As {{the water table}} control levels increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased.

40|$|An {{application}} of bifurcation theory to {{the stability of}} Arctic sea ice cover is described. After reviewing past such efforts, a simple mathematical representation is developed of processes identified as contributing essentially to abrupt decreases in 21 st century Arctic summer sea ice extent in climate model simulations of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM 3). The resulting nonlinear equations admit abrupt sea ice transitions resembling those in CCSM 3 and also plausibly represent further gross aspects of simulated Arctic sea ice evolution such as the accelerating decline in summer ice extent in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. Equilibrium solutions to these equations feature multiple equilibria in a physically relevant parameter regime. This enables abrupt changes to be triggered by infinitesimal changes in forcing {{in the vicinity of}} the bifurcation or, alternatively, by finite perturbations some distance from the bifurcation, although numerical experiments suggest that abrupt transitions in CCSM 3 may arise mainly from the increasing sensitivity of sea ice to fluctuations in ocean heat transport as ice thickness and extent diminish. A caveat is that behavior following a complete <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of ice cover is sensitive to aspects of the parameterization of ocean shortwave absorption. The objective is to illuminate the essential processes and not to embellish them or mix them up with others which are less important. The many simplifications also make it possible to see how the various processes interact, but also make it difficult to assess the quantitative validity of the argument.

In salmonid fish, {{the magnitude of the}} b-adrenergic response appears to vary seasonally. Thus, Cossins and Kilbey (1989) showed that in vitro the adrenergically stimulated H+ efflux in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{red blood cell}}s (RBCs) was gradually reduced during winter and increased abruptly early in the following spring. Nikinmaa and Jensen (1986) found that neither exercise nor adrenaline injection of rainbow trout in winter affected RBC volume or the pH gradient across the RBC membrane, in contrast to summer fish. These authors suggested that the number or affinity of the b-adrenergic receptors (b-ARs) might be seasonally reduced or that the activity of some other step in the cascade leading to Na+/H+ exchanger (b NHE) activation might be altered. Seasonality in magnitude and temperature sensitivity of the b-adrenergic response has also been shown in vitro in RBCs of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus; Lecklin and Nikinmaa, 1999). By contrast, Tetens et al. (1988) found no difference in the magnitude and affinity of the b-adrenergic response of rainbow trout RBCs in vitro in winter and summer fish. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of b NHE activity is likely to impair the normal respiratory response to stress and this might negatively affect stress tolerance.

Two types of coral bleaching had been thoroughly discussed in the scientific literature; the first is primarily associated with mass coral bleaching events; the second is a <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of algae and/or pigments. Here, we describe a phenomenon that has been witnessed for repeated summers in the mesophotic zone (40 - 63 m) in the northern Red Sea: seasonal bleaching and recovery of several hermatypic coral species. In this study, we followed the recurring bleaching process of the common coral Stylophora pistillata. Bleaching occurred from April to September with a 66 % decline in chlorophyll a concentration, while recovery began in October. Using aquarium and transplantation experiments, we explored environmental factors such as temperature, photon flux density and heterotrophic food availability. Our experiments and observations did not yield one single factor, alone, responsible for the seasonal bleaching. The dinoflagellate symbionts (of the genus Symbiodinium) in shallow (5 m) Stylophora pistillata {{were found to have}} a net photosynthetic rate of 56. 98 - 92. 19 µmol O 2 cm(- 2) day(- 1).

But during months when these mesophotic corals are partially-bleached, they yielded higher net production, between - 2. 83 - 0. 76 µmol O 2 cm(- 2) day(- 1).

40|$|Size-selective {{predation}} by fish {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a primary driver of seasonal declines in large-bodied Daphnia populations. However, large Daphnia commonly exhibit midsummer extinctions in ponds lacking plank-tivorous fish. A number of empirical and theoretical studies suggest that resource competition and its interaction with nutrient enrichment may determine variable dominance by large Daphnia. Low resource levels may favor competitive dominance by small-bodied taxa while large Daphnia may be favored under high resource conditions or following a nutrient/productivity pulse. Nutrient enrichment may also influence the strength of invertebrate predation on Daphnia by affecting how long vulnerable juveniles are exposed to predation. We investigated these hypotheses using an in situ mesocosm experiment in a permanent fishless pond that exhibited <b>seasonal</b> <b>losses</b> of Daphnia pulex. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment, Daphnia plus a diverse assemblage of small-bodied zooplankton were exposed to three levels of enrichment (low, medium, and high). To explore the interaction between nutrient enrichment and invertebrate predation, we crossed the presence/absence of Notonecta undulata with low and high nutrient manipulations. We found no evidence of competitive reversals or shifts in dominance among nutrient levels, Daphnia performed poorly regardless of enrichment. This may have been due to shifts in algal composition to dominance by large filamentous green algae. Notonecta had significant negative effects o...|$|R

The CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, two of the main crop growth models incorporated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were developed to simulate the effects of environmental conditions, different management strategies, and genetics on crop growth and development. These models currently do not have an option for calculating erosion and phosphorus (P) dynamics. In this study, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and sediment-bound P model were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean models. The evapotranspiration component of the CERES model was also evaluated to test the ability of the model to simulate the effects of shelterbelts on corn transpiration. Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3 H) and unsheltered (25 H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0. 53 mm d- 1 (3 H) and 0. 75 mm d- 1 (25 H) in 2001, and 0. 85 mm d- 1 (3 H) and 0. 59 mm d- 1 (25 H) in 2002. Average coefficient of determination (r 2) for 2001 and 2002 was 0. 90 and 0. 73, respectively. After erosion and sediment-bound P subroutines were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, the models were calibrated and tested using five years of data collected from two field sites in a watershed in Tama County, Iowa. Results showed that generally both models tended to over or underpredict daily sediment and sediment-bound P losses from fields, but they simulated seasonal values reasonably well. For CERES model, the error between simulated and measured <b>seasonal</b> sediment <b>losses</b> was less than 10 % in three out of the five years, while in four out of the five years, the difference between simulated and measured sediment loss was less than 15 % for the CROPGRO.

Within western Oregon’s Williamette Valley, we examined winter resident Dunlin Calidris alpina movements {{in relation to a}} decrease in availability of preferred shorebird foraging habitat from early to late winter of 1999 – 2000. By tracking movements of 15 (early winter) and 12 (late winter) radiomarked individuals, we calculated home ranges and characterized presence/absence of a preference for shorebird foraging habitat during each winter period. Between periods, we compared: (1) percentage of shorebird habitat in home ranges to its availability in the landscape (regional preference), (2) percentage of radio locations in shorebird habitat to its availability within home ranges (local preference) and (3) relative use of roost sites. Concurrent with a 75 % decrease in available shorebird habitat from early to late winter, average home range sizes increased by a factor of 3. 8. At a regional scale, home ranges in early winter included a significantly greater percentage of shorebird foraging habitat than was available in the wider landscape. However, by late winter, the percent of shorebird habitat in home ranges did not match availability in the landscape. At the local scale, for both winter periods Dunlin were located in shorebird foraging habitat more often than expected given availability of habitat within home ranges [Correction added after online publication 23 May 2008 : sentence amended]. An {{increase in the number of}} roosts used from early to late winter implies possible reliance on additional sites in late winter for foraging opportunities.

40|$|The {{impact and}} {{significance}} of uncertainties in model calculations of stratospheric ozone loss resulting from known uncertainty in chemical kinetics parameters is evaluated in trajectory chemistry simulations for the Antarctic and Arctic polar vortices. The uncertainty in modeled ozone loss is derived from Monte Carlo scenario simulations varying the kinetic (reaction and photolysis rate) parameters within their estimated uncertainty bounds. Simulations of a typical winter/spring Antarctic vortex scenario and Match scenarios in the Arctic produce large uncertainty in ozone loss rates and integrated <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss.</b> The simulations clearly indicate that the dominant source of model uncertainty in polar ozone loss is uncertainty in the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis reaction, which arises from uncertainty in laboratory-measured molecular cross sections at atmospherically important wavelengths. This estimated uncertainty in J Cl 2 O 2 from laboratory measurements seriously hinders our ability to model polar ozone loss within useful quantitative error limits. Atmospheric observations, however, suggest that the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis uncertainty may be less than that derived from the lab data. Comparisons to Match, South Pole ozonesonde, and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data all show that the nominal recommended rate simulations agree with data within uncertainties when the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis error is reduced {{by a factor of}} two, in line with previous in situ ClO x measurements. Comparisons to simulations using recent cross sections from Pope et al. (2007) are outside the constrained error bounds in each case. Other reactions producing significant sensitivity in polar ozone loss include BrO + ClO and its branching ratios. These uncertainties challenge our confidence in modeling polar ozone depletion and projecting future changes in response to changing halogen emissions and climate.

We hypothesized that exposing female hamsters to short (inhibitory) as opposed to long (control) photoperiods would induce an apoptosis-mediated disruption of ovarian function. Ovaries and plasma from hamsters exposed to either long (LD, 16 h light: 8 h darkness) or short (SD, 8 h light: 16 h darkness) days were collected during diestrus II after 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks and processed for histology or RIA respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by in situ TUNEL and active caspase- 3 protein immunolabeling. No significant differences were observed among LD hamsters for any parameter; therefore, these control data were pooled. SD exposure induced a decline in preantral follicles (P < 0. 05), early antral/antral follicles (P < 0. 01) and corpora lutea (P < 0. 01) by week 12 as compared with LD. Terminal atretic follicles appeared by SD week 9; by week 12, these had become the predominant ovarian structures. Estradiol concentrations decreased by weeks 9 and 12 SD when compared with both LD and week- 3 SD hamsters (P < 0. 05); however, no changes were observed for progesterone. TUNEL-positive follicles in SD ovaries increased at week 3 and subsequently declined by week 12 as compared with LD ovaries (P < 0. 01). Active capsase- 3 protein immunostaining peaked at SD week 3 as compared with all other groups (P < 0. 01). TUNEL and capsase- 3 immunolabeling were localized to granulosa cells of late-preantral and early-antral/antral follicles. These data indicate that SD exposure rapidly induces follicular apoptosis in Siberian hamsters, which ultimately disrupts both estradiol secretion and folliculogenesis, resulting in the <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of ovarian function.

40|$|Since 1988, {{juvenile}} oyster disease (JOD) {{has resulted}} in high <b>seasonal</b> <b>losses</b> of cultured Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in the Northeast. Although the cause of JOD remains unknown, most evidence is consistent with either a bacterial or a protistan etiology. For the purpose of discerning between these hypotheses, the antibacterial antibiotics norfloxacin and sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim (Romet-B) were {{tested for the ability}} to delay the onset of JOD mortality and/or reduce the JOD mortality of cultured juvenile C. virginica. Hatchery-produced C. virginica seed were exposed in triplicate groups of 3, 000 animals each to either norfloxacin, sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, or filter-sterilized seawater (FSSW) and deployed in floating trays on the Damariscotta River of Maine on 17 July 1997. Each week thereafter, a subset of animals from each group was reexposed to the assigned treatment. Repeated immersion in either a sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim or a norfloxacin solution resulted in a delay in the onset of JOD mortality in treated animals and reduced weekly mortality rates. Weekly treatments with either norfloxacin or sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in cumulative mortality (55 and 67 % respectively) compared to animals treated weekly with FSSW (81 %) or those that had received only a single treatment with either norfloxacin, sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, or FSSW (77, 84, and 82 %, respectively). Bacteriological analyses revealed a numerically dominant bacterium in those animals with obvious signs of JOD. Sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene from these bacteria indicates that they are a previously undescribed species of marine α-proteobacteria...|$|R
40|$|Pumping at {{the water}} export {{facilities}} in the southern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta kills fish at and near the associated fish-salvage facilities. Correlative analyses of salvage counts with population indices have failed to provide quantitative estimates {{of the magnitude of}} this mortality. I estimated the proportional losses of Sacramento River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) to place these losses in a population context. The estimate for salmon was based on recoveries of tagged smolts released in the upper Sacramento River basin, and recovered at the fish-salvage facilities in the south Delta and in a trawling program in the western Delta. The proportion of fish salvaged increased with export flow, with a mean value around 10 % at the highest export flows recorded. Mortality was around 10 % if pre-salvage losses were about 80 %, but this value is nearly unconstrained. Losses of adult delta smelt in winter and young delta smelt in spring were estimated from salvage data (adults) corrected for estimated pre-salvage survival, or from trawl data in the southern Delta (young). These losses were divided by population size and accumulated over the respective seasons. Losses of adult delta smelt were 1 – 50 % (median 15 %) although the highest value may have been biased upward. Daily losses of larvae and juveniles were 0 – 8 %, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>losses</b> accumulated were 0 – 25 % (median 13 %). The effect of these losses on population abundance was obscured by subsequent 50 -fold variability in survival from summer to fall...|$|R

The effect of controlled drainage (CD) on ammonia volatilization (AV) losses from paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI) was investigated by managing water table control levels using a lysimeter. Three drainage treatments were implemented, namely, controlled water table depth 1 (CWT 1), controlled water table depth 2 (CWT 2), and controlled water table depth 3 (CWT 3). As the water table control levels increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased. AV losses from paddy fields reduced due to the increases in water table control levels. <b>Seasonal</b> AV <b>losses</b> from CWT 1, CWT 2, and CWT 3 were 59. 8, 56. 7, and 53. 0 kgNha− 1, respectively. AV losses from CWT 3 were 13. 1 % and 8. 4 % lower than those from CWT 1 and CWT 2, respectively. A {{significant difference in the}} <b>seasonal</b> AV <b>losses</b> was confirmed between CWT 1 and CWT 3. Less weekly AV losses followed by TF and PF were also observed as the water table control levels increased. The application of CD by increasing water table control levels to a suitable level could effectively reduce irrigation water volumes and AV losses from CI paddy fields. The combination of CI and CD may be a feasible water management method of reducing AV losses from paddy fields. 1...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Diclofop-methyl [me yl 2 -(4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy) propanoate] hydrolysis, degradation, and {{leaching}} {{were studied}} in field and laboratory experiments. Greater than 75 % of the applied diclofop-methyl hydrolyzed to diclofop in 2 days at 4 °C, the prevailing soil temperature during western Oregon winters. Degradation beyond the diclofop molecule, also an active herbicide, was much slower {{with a half}} life of 42 days. Microbial activity was identified as the primary mechanism in both the hydrolysis and degradation processes. Diclofop residues were detected in the 1 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm depths, indicating that leaching had occurred. Runoff losses of diclofop [2 -(4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy) propionic acid] were also measured following January applications to small (6. 0 and 1. 4 ha) agricultural watersheds in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Diclofop runoff losses were higher in 1980 (7. 1 and 3. 9 % of the applied herbicide at the 6. 0 and 1. 4 ha watersheds, respectively) than in 1981 (0. 7 and < 0. 1 %, respectively). In 1980, between 80 and 90 % of the diclofop <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> was partitioned into the aqueous phase of runoff. The maximum diclofop concentrations in runoff were 370 and 790 mg/m³ at the 6. 0 and 1. 4 ha watersheds, respectively. Larger diclofop losses in 1980 were attributed to (1) the close proximity of large runoff events to the application date and (2) the high antecedent soil moisture status prior to the first runoff event {{which resulted in a}} high percentage runoff. The presence of a soil surface crust limited the depth to which overland flow extracted diclofop residues from the soil profile and resulted in very shallow calculated mixing depths (0. 13 - 0. 16 cm). A subsurface drainage system installed at the 1. 4 ha watershed effectively lowered antecedent soil moisture as compared to the 6. 0 ha watershed. Consequently, percentage runoff and diclofop runoff losses were reduced at the 1. 4 ha watershed. Diclofop losses in the subsurface drainage effluent accounted for 1. 2 and < 0. 1 % of the applied herbicide in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Subsurface drainage and changing the herbicide application date were recommended as potential management practices...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic sea {{ice cover}} {{declined}} {{over the last}} few decades and reached a record minimum in 2007, with a slight recovery thereafter. Inspired by this the authors investigate the response of atmospheric and oceanic properties to a 1 -yr period of reduced sea ice cover. Two ensembles of equilibrium and transient simulations are produced with the Community Climate System Model. A sea ice change is induced through an albedo change of 1 yr. The sea ice area and thickness recover in both ensembles after 3 and 5 yr, respectively. The sea ice anomaly leads to changes in ocean temperature and salinity to a depth of about 200 m in the Arctic Basin. Further, the salinity and temperature changes in the surface layer trigger a “Great Salinity Anomaly” in the North Atlantic that takes roughly 8 yr to travel across the North Atlantic back to high latitudes. In the atmosphere the changes induced by the sea ice anomaly do not last as long as in the ocean. The response in the transient and equilibrium simulations, while similar overall, differs in specific regional and temporal details. The surface air temperature increases over the Arctic Basin and the anomaly extends through the whole atmospheric column, changing the geopotential height fields and thus the storm tracks. The patterns of warming and thus the position of the geopotential height changes vary in the two ensembles. While the equilibrium simulation shifts the storm tracks to the south over the eastern North Atlantic and Europe, the transient simulation shifts the storm tracks south over the western North Atlantic and North America. The authors propose that the overall reduction in sea ice cover is important for producing ocean anomalies; however, for atmospheric anomalies the regional location of the sea ice anomalies is more important. While observed trends in Arctic sea ice are large and exceed those simulated by comprehensive climate models, there is little evidence based on this particular model that the <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of sea ice (e. g., as occurred in 2007) would constitute a threshold after which the Arctic would exhibit nonlinear, irreversible, or strongly accelerated sea ice loss. Caution should be exerted when extrapolating short-term trends to future sea ice behavior...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis was}} conducted using long-term continuous measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and particulate phase mercury (Hg P) at coastal (Thompson Farm, denoted as TF), marine (Appledore Island, denoted as AI), and elevated inland (Pac Monadnock, denoted as PM) sites from the AIRMAP Observatories in southern New Hampshire, USA. Decreasing trends in background Hg 0 were identified in the 7. 5 - and 5. 5 -yr records at TF and PM with decline rates of 3. 3 parts per quadrillion by volume (ppqv) yr − 1 and 6. 3 ppqv yr − 1, respectively. Common characteristics at these sites were the reproducible annual cycle of Hg 0 with its maximum in winter-spring and minimum in fall, comprised of a positive trend in the warm season (spring – early fall) and a negative one in the cool season (late fall – winter). Year-to-year variability was observed in the warm season decline in Hg 0 at TF varying from a minimum total (complete) <b>seasonal</b> <b>loss</b> of 43 ppqv in 2009 {{to a maximum of}} 92 ppqv in 2005, whereas variability remained small at AI and PM. The coastal site TF differed from the other two sites with its exceptionally low levels (as low as below 50 ppqv) in the nocturnal inversion layer possibly due to dissolution in dew water. Measurements of Hg 0 at PM exhibited the smallest diurnal to annual variability among the three environments, where peak levels rarely exceeded 250 ppqv and the minimum was typically 100 ppqv. It should be noted that summertime diurnal patterns at TF and AI were opposite in phase indicating strong sink(s) for Hg 0 during the day in the marine boundary layer, which was consistent with the hypothesis of Hg 0 oxidation by halogen radicals there. Mixing ratios of RGM in the coastal and marine boundary layers reached annual maxima in spring and minima in fall, whereas at PM levels were generally below the limit of detection (LOD) except in spring. RGM levels at AI were higher than at TF and PM indicating a stronger source strength in the marine environment. Mixing ratios of Hg P at AI and TF were close in magnitude to RGM levels and were mostly below 1 ppqv. Diurnal variation in Hg P was barely discernible at TF and AI in spring and summer. Higher levels of Hg P were observed during the day, while values that were smaller, but above the LOD, occurred at night...|$|E

40|$|In the Siberian hamster, <b>seasonal</b> weight <b>loss</b> occurs {{gradually}} {{over many}} weeks during autumn and winter. This {{is driven by}} a regulatory mechanism that is able to integrate duration of exposure to short days (SDs) {{with the size of}} body energy reserves. After food restriction in SDs, followed by ad libitum refeeding, body weight of the hamster does not return to its former level; rather, it increases to a level defined by the length of time spent in SDs. In this report, we show that components of the thyroid hormone system that are involved in <b>seasonal</b> weight <b>loss</b> change expression in response to 48 h of starvation. Eight weeks in an SD photoperiod induced weight loss in the Siberian hamster. In the hypothalamus of these hamsters, type II deiodinase expression was decreased and type III deiodinase expression was induced, but there was no change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y or thyrotropin-releasing hormone gene expression. For the first time, we show that the thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 is expressed in tanycytes and is increased in response to an SD photoperiod. Food restriction (48 h of starvation) reversed the direction of gene expression change for type II and III deiodinase and monocarboxylate transporter 8 induced by SD photoperiods. Furthermore, fasting increased neuropeptide Y expression and decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone expression. VGF, a gene upregulated in SDs in the dorsal region of the medial posterior area of the arcuate nucleus, was not changed by starvation. These data point to a mechanism whereby energy deprivation can interact with an SD photoperiod on hypothalamic tanycytes to regulate components of the thyroid hormone system involved in photoperiodic regulation of seasonal physiolog...|$|R

Geometric means (±standard deviation) of total pesticide loads for chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) and α- and β-endosulfan (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 -hexachloro- 1, 5, 5 a, 6, 9, 9 a-hexahydro- 6, 9 -methano- 2, 4, 3 -benzodioxathiepin 3 -oxide) for a runoff event were 19, 6, and 9 times greater from polyethylene (800 ± 4. 6, 17. 6 ± 3. 9, and 39. 1 ± 4. 9 μg m- 2, respectively) than from hairy vetch mulch plots (42 ± 6. 0, 2. 8 ± 5. 0, and 4. 3 ± 4. 6 μg m- 2, respectively) due to greater concentrations and larger runoff volumes.
