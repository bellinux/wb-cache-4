5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} toll on the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> damage done by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E

5|$|Growing {{government}} spending, large wage raises, {{and inefficient}} production created a chronic inflation that {{rose through the}} 1980s, when it briefly exceeded {{an annual rate of}} 1000%. Successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and price controls, cuts in public spending, and restriction of the money supply. Efforts to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into conﬂict with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> exodus of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem,</b> of <b>the</b> quill variety, is {{attached}} to the fork's steerer tube using an expander bolt which fits through <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> from <b>the</b> top with a wedge at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> fits inside <b>the</b> steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> for adjustment, undo the bolt on the top of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|R

5|$|The Flames uniform {{received}} mixed reviews. Detractors {{compared the}} uniform to the outfit Ronald McDonald wears. They proved popular with fans, however; the league revealed {{a few days}} before the game that 16,000 Flames jerseys had been sold, compared to about 6,000 Montreal jerseys. Cheaper, unlicensed copies were widely available online and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police worked to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> sale of counterfeit merchandise that was misrepresented as being authentic.|$|E

The player assumes {{the role of a}} soldier trying to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Like System Shock, gameplay consists of first-person combat and exploration. It also incorporates role-playing system elements, in which the player can develop skills and traits, such as hacking and psionic abilities.|$|E

5000|$|In musical notation, <b>stems</b> are <b>the,</b> [...] "thin, {{vertical}} {{lines that}} are {{directly connected to}} the note head." [...] Stems may point up or down. Different-facing <b>stems</b> indicate <b>the</b> voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff. Within one voice, <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> points up from a notehead, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> originates from <b>the</b> right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a chord contains a second, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> runs between <b>the</b> two notes with the higher being placed {{on the right of}} <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and <b>the</b> lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> while <b>the</b> middle note will be on the wrong side.|$|R
5|$|The pottery {{found at}} the site were in {{an early stage of}} hand crafting, of the coarse variety, in steel-grey, dull red, brown, and buff colours with mat prints at the bottom; they were in the shape of bowl, vase and <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> antiquities did not reveal any signs of burials sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain <b>stem.</b> <b>The</b> hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|To <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> loss of {{passengers}} and resulting deficits, the B {{in the early}} 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to the Auto Train), and onboard movies, to attract more passengers. The train was marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of <b>the</b> bubble, {{the shape}} of the bubble is nearly cylindrical; consequently, either R3 or R4 is large while the other radius of {{curvature}} is small. As <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> of <b>the</b> bubble grows in length, it becomes more unstable as one of the radius grows and the other shrinks. At a certain point, the vertical length of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> exceeds <b>the</b> circumference of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and due to the buoyancy forces the bubble separates and the process repeats.|$|R

5|$|A global {{strategy}} to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> crisis {{was released in}} 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to control}} {{materials}} {{coming into the}} country was put forward in early 1937, effectively subjecting the Spanish Republic to international isolation, but was mocked by German and Italian decisive and immediate support for the rebel faction. The subject of volunteers was also much discussed, with little result; although agreements were signed late on in the war, these were made outside the Committee. Efforts to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> flow of war materials to Spain were largely unsuccessful, with foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War proving instrumental to its outcome. Nazi Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union consistently broke the agreement they had signed, France occasionally so. Britain remained largely faithful to it.|$|E
5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E

5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
