40|$|International audienceThe {{land vehicle}} {{navigation}} using very few GPS updates is studied {{in this paper}} using a low-cost MEMS <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> integrated with a conventional GPS receiver. The <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> is composed of triad of accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers {{as well as a}} pressure sensor, and can easily be taken in or off the car. Since in most of cities, downtown areas block GPS signals, conventional receivers {{may not be able to}} compute 3 D or even 2 D fixes. Therefore, to augment the availability of the position solution in harsh environments, pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements are fused in a Kalman Filter (KF) with the Dead Reckoning (DR) solution provided by the <b>sensors</b> <b>assembly</b> following a tight integration scheme. In the developed vehicular navigation algorithm, the MEMS sensors are used to provide reliable attitude information of the vehicle. It also propagates the position of the vehicle in three dimensions. A conventional GPS receiver gives pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements for the tight integration. External ephemeredes are used to estimate the satellite Doppler contribution in the user-to-satellite Line Of Sight (LOS). Results show that as soon as two satellites are tracked, the overall accuracy of the integrated positioning system increases. Moreover, the availability of the position solutions is also augmented. Depending on the type of harsh environments, namely classical or deep urban canyons, heavy map-matching algorithms are not required with such low-cost sensors integration. However, the integration scheme is dependent on the satellite geometry with respect to the user's heading. When a bad satellite configuration is detected, the Integrated Navigation System (INS) relies exclusively on the IMU data. As a consequence, the INS may experience systematic drift for long periods (> 1 min) without any GPS updates...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA microelectromechanical direction-finding sensor {{has been developed}} based on the mechanically coupled ears of the Ormia ochracea fly. Previous designs determined the direction of sound relative to the normal of the sensor by using the sound pressure level at the sensor. However, these designs suffered from a left-right ambiguity. To overcome these shortcomings, a dual <b>sensor</b> <b>assembly</b> was created. Two sensors co-located at an offset angle allow direction finding across 120 Â°. This eliminated ambiguous angles and the requirement for a sound pressure level. For this study, the dual <b>sensor</b> <b>assembly</b> was fabricated using two custom circuit boards powered by a 9 V battery and arranged on a 3 D-printed mount. The resonant frequency of the sensors produced a 260 V/Pa output at 1. 690 kHz Â± 20 Hz. Experimental work was done in an anechoic chamber, and outputs were captured using lock-in amplifiers. The angle error ranged from less than 0. 3 Â° close to the normal axis (0 Â°) to 3. 4 Â° at the limits of coverage, Â± 60 Â°. The outcome {{of this research is}} {{that it is possible to}} operate this microelectromechanical direction-finding <b>sensor</b> <b>assembly</b> to find the bearing of a signal on resonance over an angular range of 120 Â° with a maximum uncertainty of 3. 4 Â°.
