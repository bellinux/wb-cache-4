40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the swordfish fishery in the Turkish Aegean Sea are presented. A total of 65 boats (6 - 14 m {{in length and}} 11. 5 - 135 hp in engine power) participated in this fishery from two main fishing ports, Sivrice and Fethiye, and the Datça-Bozburun Peninsula. This fishery is also carried out off Antalya Bay. The total annual swordfish catch was 425 t in 2005. The fishing period for swordfish normally takes place during eight months. However, the main activity is concentrated {{in the spring and}} summer seasons on moonless nights, because of the closed season (between October 1 and January 31) and adverse meteorological conditions. Although, there are various fishing gears and techniques for swordfish, the two main fishing gears used in the Aegean Sea are longline and driftnet. About ten non-target <b>species,</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> Atlantic black skipjack, albacore, Mediterranean spearfish, bullet tuna, dolphinfish, manta ray, sunfish, sharks and dolphins were determined from both longlining and drift-netting.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Inter-Research {{and can be}} found at: [URL] spawning habitats of many large marine pelagic predators are poorly known. This lack of knowledge hampers conservation efforts that are aimed at identifying critical habitats for the spawning of these species. We hypothesized that phylogenetically related species show different adaptations and respond differently to environmental and geographical cues for when and where to spawn. We tested this hypothesis on a 5 yr data set (2001 to 2005) from the Balearic Islands region (Mediterranean Sea), targeting the early larval stage of 3 abundant species of tuna: bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus, a large migratory oceanic species; albacore T. alalunga, a smaller species; and bullet tuna Auxis rochei, often found closer to coastal areas. The spatial distribution of spawning locations at the regional scale differed for the 3 tuna <b>species.</b> <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> relied heavily on environmental signals, and therefore their spawning habitats can vary depending on the environment. In contrast, the spawning habitat of albacore and bullet tuna was driven mostly by geography and was less variable over contrasting environmental conditions.

40|$|The waters {{surrounding}} the Balearic archipelago {{are considered to}} be prime spawning habitats of the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and other tuna species such as albacore (T. alalunga) in the Mediterranean. During the 2003 bluefin and albacore spawning season, a tuna larval survey (TUNIBAL 0703) was carried out to assess the distribution of bluefin larvae in relation to hydrographic mesoscale features. Tuna larvae were collected by means of surface plankton tows with a bongo gear with a quadrangular mouth measuring 1 m diagonally. The otolith microstructure of 157 and 71 field-captured larvae of Mediterranean bluefin and albacore, respectively, were analyzed to estimate the daily growth pattern. Furthermore, biochemical analysis to estimate DNA, RNA and protein content was done on another batch of 114 bluefin and 132 albacore larvae. The size range included pre-flexion to post-flexion larvae, from 2. 8 to 8. 6 mm in body length. bluefin and albacore larvae grew linearly in standard length (0. 35 and 0. 33 mm/day, respectively) and potentially with respect to dry weight. No significant differences between species were observed in the size-weight relationship, or in the allometric relationship of body size and weight to otolith radius. However, the relationship of DNA and RNA to body size and weight showed a significant difference between <b>species.</b> <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae showed a greater nucleic acid content than albacore larvae.

Based upon recent scientific perspectives, skipped spawning (delayed maturation and non-annual spawning) is possibly prevalent in moderately long-lived marine <b>species</b> like <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> In principle, skipped spawning represents a trade-off between current and future reproduction. By foregoing reproduction, an individual can incur survival and growth benefits that accrue in deferred reproduction.

A range of types of skipped spawning (constant, younger, older, event skipping; and delays in first maturation) was modeled for the western Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> population to test for their effects on the egg-production-per-recruit biological reference point (stipulated at 20 % and 40 %).

40|$|Market {{policies}} have profound implications for consumers {{as well as}} for the management of resources. One of the major concerns in fish trading is species mislabelling: the commercial name used does not correspond to the product, most often because the product is in fact a cheaper or a more easily available species. Substitution rates depend heavily on species, some often being sold mislabelled while others rarely or never mislabelled. Rates also vary largely depending on countries. In this study, we analyse the first market-wide dataset collected for France, the largest sea food market in Europe, for fish species substitution. We sequenced and analysed 371 samples bearing 55 commercial species names, collected in fishmonger shops, supermarkets and restaurants; the largest dataset assembled to date in an European country. Sampling included fish fillets, both fresh and frozen, and prepared meals. We found a total of 14 cases of mislabelling in five species: <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> cod, yellowfin tuna, sole and seabream, setting the overall substitution rate at 3. 7 % CI [2. 2 - 6. 4], one of the lowest observed for comparable surveys with large sampling. We detected no case of species mislabelling among the frozen fillets or in industrially prepared meals, and all the substitutions were observed in products sold in fishmongers shops or restaurants. The rate of mislabelling does not differ between <b>species,</b> except for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> Despite a very small sample size (n = 6), the rate observed for this species (83. 3 % CI [36 - 99]) stands in sharp contrast with the low substitution rate observed for the other substituted species.

The <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> were first recognized as two independent species (Northern and Southern bluefin) based on subtle differences in morphological characters. Northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are now recognized as morphologically, geographically and genetically separate species located in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Pacific bluefin (T. orientalis) is the only species which remains unmanaged; this lack of management persists despite intensive fisheries {{on both sides of}} the Pacific. The current life history model indicates that these fish spawn in the western Pacific (Sea of Japan, Philippine Sea and East China Sea). Either late in the first year or early in the second year, a portion of the population migrates to the western coast of the United States and Mexico, a journey of over 8700 km (Bayliff et al., 1991). The young fish that have migrated into the eastern Pacific are thought to remain there for several years, feeding on sardines and anchovies in regions of intense upwelling (Bayliff et al., 1991, Bayliff, 1993). While these tuna are fished only seasonally off California and Mexico, they may be a year-round resident (Bayliff, 1991). The migrants then travel back to the western Pacific to spawn. Why some bluefin remain in the western Pacific while others migrate across the ocean basin is unresolved.

Histological evaluations of cross sections showed that the testis consists of two structurally different regions, an outer proliferative region where germ cells develop synchronously in cysts, and a central region {{made up of a}} well-developed system of ducts that convey the spermatozoa produced in the proliferative region to the main sperm duct. Ultrastructural features of the different stages of the male germ cell line are very similar to those described in other teleost <b>species.</b> The <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> testis is of the unrestricted spermatogonial testicular type, where primary spermatogonia are present all along the germinative portion of the lobules.

The testis size was found to increase by a factor of four (on average) during migration to the Mediterranean spawning grounds, whereas the fat bodies (mesenteric lipid stores associated with the gonads) became reduced to half their weight, and the liver mass did not change significantly with sexual maturation. Linear regression analysis of the pooled data of migrant and spawning <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> revealed a significant negative correlation between the gonad index (IG) and the fat tissue index (IF), and a weaker positive correlation between the gonad index (IG) and the liver index (IL).

Its migrations have supported sustainable fisheries and impacted local cultures since antiquity, but its biogeographic range has contracted since the 1950 s. Most recently, the species disappeared from the Black Sea in the late 1980 s and has not yet recovered. Reasons for the Black Sea disappearance, and the species-wide range contraction, are unclear. However <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> formerly foraged and possibly spawned in the Black Sea.

Discussion of the management costs associated with this management system shows that fine-scale spatial management is a suitable approach for this bycatch issue.

Considering this new evidence, ICCAT has recommended in 2001 that the entire Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea will be divided into six management units based on the current knowledge of fishing grounds and the behaviour of Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> During the last 50 years, large tagging databases (e. g. conventional tags, implantable tags, pop-up tags) were compiled for different pelagic <b>species</b> including Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> In this project, we will explore the possibility of developing a statistical modeling framework that can make use of different types of tagging data information sequentially and simultaneously. The aim of this project is to try and develop improved statistical estimators of harvest rates and movement rates that incorporate mark and recapture data, fishing effort data and other available information. This will be done using a Bayesian estimation framework, so that prior information on model parameters, where available, may be taken into account and that uncertainty in model parameters and structures may be taken into account in a probabilistic framework.

A total of 286 larvae were analyzed for this study, of which 72 larvae corresponded to bluefin, 57 to albacore, 81 to bullet tuna and 76 to little tunny. Tuna larvae were separated into the pre-flexion and post-flexion developmental stages. Within the size 3 – 9 mm standard length (SL), the stable isotope of nitrogen (δ 15 N) showed significant differences between <b>species</b> where <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae ranked highest. Pre-flexion <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and little tunny larvae showed significantly higher δ 15 N signatures than the post-flexion larvae. This effect is attributed to a biochemical trace of maternal δ 15 N signatures. However, neither albacore nor bullet tuna larvae showed this pattern in δ 15 N signatures, possibly owing to a compensation effect between lower maternal δ 15 N values transmitted to pre-flexion larvae and the early increase of δ 15 N values in post-flexion stages. One way ANOVA showed significant differences between species in the stable isotope ratio of carbon (δ 13 C) values, which suggests specific differences of carbon sources. Furthermore, a similar significant ontogenic effect between δ 13 C signatures of pre-flexion and post-flexion larvae is also evidenced in all four species. At pre-flexion stages, all species except bullet tuna larvae showed significant negative relationships between δ 15 N and larval standard length. At post-flexion stages, a significant linear relationship with larval size was only observed in albacore and bullet tuna larvae indicating a possible trophic shift towards early piscivory. With respect to δ 13 C values with larval size, all four species showed significant linear decreases. It {{may be explained by}} the metabolism of growth of somatic mass subject to modification of the relative carbon isotopic sources. In conclusion, the species' signatures of δ 15 N and δ 13 C indicate differentiated early life trophic niches.

40|$|<b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus spp.) are a {{globally}} threatened {{fish that}} currently constitutes {{one of the}} most economically important food fisheries in the world. Culture efforts have intensified in recent years to maximise fishery profitability and mitigate market dependency on wild stock; yet little is currently known concerning health and immune functions and best culture practices continue to be investigated. In an attempt to aid future aquaculture interests and to provide general tools for identifying immune responses and disease status for this group of fishes, this thesis investigated a number of immune and disease-identifying aspects of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> through the use of molecular laboratory techniques centering on quantitative PCR. In the course of this research, six full length and thirteen partial mRNA transcripts were newly identified for two <b>bluefin</b> <b>species</b> [Southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus maccoyii (SBT) and Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus orientalis (PBT) ] which represent a suite of genetic markers involved in immune, stress, growth, and inflammatory functions. As temperature is known to influence inflammatory signalling in mammals, in vitro stimulations and subsequent gene expression analyses were conducted on cells of SBT to identify the effects temperature might play during an immune response in these uniquely heterothermic fish. Results from these experiments suggested that temperature exerts influence in the timing but not the degree of an innate inflammatory response in <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and also that different cell populations have differential responsiveness to heat shock in this heterothermic species. Additionally, heat shock co-activation of the IL- 8 chemokine previously identified in mammals is also likely present in bluefin and suggests that increased immune cell trafficking has long been incorporated into the stress responses of vertebrates. Infections by three species of blood fluke from the genus Cardicola – C. forsteri, C. orientalis, and C. opisthorchis – represent the greatest disease concern for the sea-cage culture of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> Using real-time qPCR and novel applications of SYBR green nucleic acid dye in combination with a TaqMan probe common reporter system, sensitive quantitative detection of parasite species-specific DNA was achieved and was effective for identifying parasite in samples of host blood, gill, and heart of both SBT and PBT species. This identified infections earlier and more sensitively than either histology or microscopy methods previously employed. These detection techniques were used in conjunction with gene expression analyses to demonstrate that organ-specific transcriptive immune responses occurred in PBT during natural infection which mirrored the relative quantity of pathogenic load. Although ineffective at combating infection during primary exposure, this research demonstrates a cellular immune response is mounted in PBT as a potential rejoinder to future Cardicola exposure and/or mitigation against tissue destruction caused by the parasite. Further, IgM transcription was highly correlated to the relative abundance of C. orientalis but not C. opisthorchis DNA in gill samples, suggesting that host IgM transcription may be targeted to species or life stage specific antigen. Lastly, Praziquantel (PZQ), a drug long used in veterinary and human medicine for the treatment of helminth parasites and currently applied to treat Cardicola infections in tuna, has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune response in mammals. Here, PZQ was shown to induce gene transcriptional changes in immune-competent primary tissue cultures of both SBT and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Although expression profiles varied between species and tissue type, PZQ was observed to significantly induce both T cell receptor and IL- 8 transcriptional expression in all cultures, as well as creating a general pattern of heightened antiviral signalling that included elevated transcription of both Type I (IFNα) and Type II (IFNγ) interferon along with elevated expression of MHC class I. These findings identify a direct immunomodulatory ability of PZQ in immune cells of fish and provide support for further investigation into the immunostimulant/adjuvant capabilities of this drug in fish culture. This work also aids in understanding the mode of action for this drug in the treatment of Cardicola infection in <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna...</b>|$|R

This pattern can be formalized as the range–abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that {{has important implications for}} the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2 % and 46 % loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11 – 29 % increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three <b>species</b> of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and several marlin species.

Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses revealed {{a high level of}} sequence conservation between sbtElovl 5 and fatty acyl elongase sequences from other fish species. Heterologous expression of the sbtElovl 5 ORF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that it encoded a fatty acyl elongase capable of elongating C(18 / 20) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, but not C(22) PUFA substrates. For the first time in an Elovl 5, the substrate competition occurring in nature was investigated. Higher activity towards n- 3 PUFA substrates than omega- 6 (n- 6) PUFA substrates was exhibited, regardless of substrate chain length. The sbtElovl 5 preferentially elongated 18 : 4 n- 3 and 18 : 3 n- 6 rather than 20 : 5 n- 3 and 20 : 4 n- 6. The sbtElovl 5 enzyme also elongated saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Melissa K.

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen years, the market for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> has evolved {{in an attempt to}} further enhance the {{economic}} value of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> landings. Historically, the US East Coast has been a major supplier of high quality <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> to Japan, the primary market for sashimi grade tuna. To date, many questions regarding the economic feasibility of offshore aquaculture, and in particular offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming in the United States, remain unanswered. This research assesses the economic feasibility of an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture industry located on the East Coast of the US by developing a dynamic stochastic adaptive bioeconomic model of such an offshore enterprise. The bioeconomic model incorporates the biological constraints of the species, the interaction of relevant economic parameters and constraints, and stochastic sources of risk, to solve for the profit maximizing behavior of a farmed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> producer. This research identifies the optimal harvest schedule for an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming facility that maximizes the net present value of the operation under a variety of economic, biological and regulatory conditions. Economic feasibility is analyzed using profitability indicators including net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). This research is relevant given the continued expansion of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture globally, the increasing demand for high-quality <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> and the uncertainty regarding the economic feasibility of an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture industry in the United States...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the Atlantic Ocean, spawning in the western Atlantic has been recorded predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in spring. Larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances from the northern GOM are formulated into an index used to tune the adult stock assessment, and the variability of this index is currently high. This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catch locations, and a suite of environmental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, {{would be more likely}} to contain <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae. Favorable habitat for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae was defined using a classification tree approach. Habitat within the Loop Current was generally less favorable, as were warmcore rings, and cooler waters on the continental shelf. The location and size of favorable habitat was highly variable among years, which was reflected in the locations of larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catches. The model successfully placed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae in favorable habitat with nearly 90 % accuracy, but many negative stations were also located within theoretically favorable habitat. The probability of collecting larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> in favorable habitat was nearly twice the probability of collecting <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae across all habitats (35. 5 versus 21. 0 %). This model is a useful addition to knowledge of larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> distributions; however, the incorporation of variables describing finer-scale features, such as thermal fronts, may significantly improve the model’s predictive power...|$|R

40|$|Background  The {{largest of}} the <b>tuna</b> <b>species,</b> Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus), inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and is {{considered}} to be an endangered species, largely a consequence of overfishing. T. thynnusaquaculture, referred to as fattening or farming, is a capture based activity dependent on yearly renewal from the wild. Thus, the development of aquaculture practices independent of wild resources can provide an important contribution towards ensuring security and sustainability of this species in the longer-term. The development of such practices is today greatly assisted by large scale transcriptomic studies.   Results  We have used pyrosequencing technology to sequence a mixed-tissue normalised cDNA library, derived from adultT. thynnus. A total of 976, 904 raw sequence reads were assembled into 33, 105 unique transcripts having a mean length of 893 bases and an N 50 of 870. Of these, 33. 4 % showed similarity to known proteins or gene transcripts and 86. 6 % of them were matched to the congeneric Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus orientalis) genome, compared to 70. 3 % for the more distantly related Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) genome. Transcript sequences were used to develop a novel 15 K Agilent oligonucleotide DNA microarray forT. thynnusand comparative tissue gene expression profiles were inferred for gill, heart, liver, ovaries and testes. Functional contrasts were strongest between gills and ovaries. Gills were particularly associated with immune system, signal transduction and cell communication, while ovaries displayed signatures of glycan biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, transcription, translation, replication and repair.   Conclusions  Sequence data generated from a novel mixed-tissueT. thynnuscDNA library provide an important transcriptomic resource that can be further employed for study of various aspects ofT. thynnusecology and genomics, with strong applications in aquaculture. Tissue-specific gene expression profiles inferred through the use of novel oligo-microarray can serve in the design of new and more focused transcriptomic studies for future research of tuna physiology and assessment of the welfare in a production environment...|$|R

However this fishing method was {{replaced}} by <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catches with long-line, initially as a by-catch in the swordfish fisheries prior to fine-tuning the gear for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> in 1995, when the Japanese bought <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> caught by Maltese fishermen. Total <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> long-line fisheries landings in the Maltese Islands have followed an overall decline from a peak of 353, 014 kg in 1995 to 227, 008 kg in 2006. Close to 400 <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> specimens caught south of the Maltese Islands, were sampled during six years to study variations in sizes, sex ratios, biogeographic characteristics and molecular genetics using four microsatellite loci. This study results indicate decreasing average <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catch body size and an increasing sex bias with females composing the greater percentage of specimens caught. A significant genetic heterogeneity, FST value of 0. 018 (P= 0. 015), was found among the <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> sampled in the spawning and fishing region south of the Maltese Islands.

40|$|El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an {{important}} driver of interannual variations in climate and ecosystem productivity in tropical regions. However, detailed information about this important phenomenon of the Indian Ocean is scarce. Consequently, {{the objective of this}} study is to improve understanding of the impact of warm event El Nino and cool event La Nina on annual tuna landings from the Indian Ocean from 1980 to 2010. In this study, maximum tuna landings were recorded during a weak El Nino year (1456054 t in 2006) and during a weak La Nina year (1243562 t in 2000), although the lowest tuna catch was followed during the strong El Nino year (1204119 t in 2009) and during a strong La Nina year (706546 t in 1988).
