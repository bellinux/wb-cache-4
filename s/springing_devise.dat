40|$|Dehydration of {{different}} varieties of rice {{has been studied}} employing for dehydration a current of hot air or vacuum desiccation over phosphorus pentoxide. Sorption and desorption of water vapour by rice under isothermal conditions has also been studied in a modified form of the quartz <b>spring</b> microbalance <b>devised</b> by McBain and Bakr. It is found that superior varieties of rice lose water more readily during dehydration and take up water {{at a faster rate}} and {{to a greater extent than}} varieties of poorer quality. Rice obtained from paddy that has aged is capable of easier hydration and dehydration than a sample of the same variety from freshly harvested paddy. The investigations indicate that the capillaries in superior varieties of rice are broader than those in inferior kinds. Storage of paddy seems to cause a widening of these capillaries. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} a pair {{of linear}} <b>springs</b> we <b>devise</b> a nonlinear vibrator. For a one dimensional scenario the nonlinear force is composed of a polynomial of odd powers of position-dependent variable {{greater than or equal}} three. For a chosen initial condition without compromising the generality of the problem we analyze the problem considering only the leading cubic term. We solve the equation of motion analytically leading to The Jacobi Elliptic Function. To avoid the complexity of the latter, we propose a practical, intuitive-based and easy to use alternative semi-analytic method producing the same result. We demonstrate that our method is intuitive and practical vs. the plug-in Jacobi function. According to the proposed procedure, higher order terms such as quintic and beyond easily may be included in the analysis. We also extend the application of our method considering a system of a three-linear spring. Mathematica [1] is being used throughout the investigation and proven to be an indispensable computational tool. </p...|$|R

Much of the production was exported to the Commonwealth countries. One innovation introduced by Abingdon was the first telescopic shock absorber. Motorcycles of the day often had no front suspension or some form of <b>springs,</b> but Abingdon <b>devised</b> the [...] "Abingdon Spring Fork", a coil sprung, telescopic shock absorber.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{methodology}} for the optimum design of composite helical springs with braided fibrous reinforcement {{is presented in}} this article. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is implemented to optimize two conflicting goals: minimize mass and maximize stiffness. Several design variables that have an influence on the mechanical properties of the spring must be considered: the braiding angle, number of plies and the standard design parameters of a helical spring. Design goals are set such as for standard metallic springs: equivalent mechanical performance, mass reduction, and comparable cost. Three different braided reinforcements in carbon, kevlar, and glass were analyzed with the same epoxy matrix. In helical springs, shear plays the most important role on spring performance. Taking into account the shear properties of braided composites {{and a series of}} technological constraints, a range of composite <b>springs</b> was <b>devised,</b> among which an optimal spring was selected for an automotive application, namely to replace the metallic spring of the suspension of a sport utility vehicle.

He {{clashes with}} his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow (Dennis O'Keefe), {{over the fact that}} his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from <b>springing</b> a carefully <b>devised</b> trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotational}} spring {{model for}} determining the natural frequencies of cracked beams needs two parameters, the severity represented by the spring stiffness and its position along the beam to represent the crack. The eventual application, namely {{the identification of the}} severity of the crack and its location, is a challenging task. Previous detection methodologies suppose linear variation between frequency changes and spring stiffness in early stages of damage, making it possible to eliminate the severity factor through statistical processes and perform the numerical search for the location. In this paper, we present a property of the characteristic equation of a cracked beam using the rotational <b>spring</b> model <b>devised</b> from the determinantal equation of the dynamic stiffness matrix, allowing us to separate the severity and the location parameters in perfectly known terms, one with the characteristic equation of the undamaged beam and the other with the characteristic equation of the beam with a hinge at the location of the damage. Numerical examples to verify the agreement with previous closed-form results were performed with high accuracy and the identification of crack parameters was done successfully without any assumption regarding to the severity for a beam with a crack...|$|R

From whence there may arise many admirable advantages, towards the increase of the Operative, and the Mechanick Knowledge, to which this Age seems so much inclined, because we may perhaps be inabled to discern all the secret workings of Nature, almost {{in the same manner as}} we do those that are the productions of Art, and are manag'd by Wheels, and Engines, and <b>Springs,</b> that were <b>devised</b> by humane Wit.|$|R

A method {{of this type}} would provide the replicability not now available in the newly developed field of psycho pharmacology. For example, the method employing the Cold <b>Spring</b> Harbor questionnaire <b>devised</b> by the writer and his co-workers has been criticized as being â€œ¿toosuggestibleâ€•, â€œ¿toostructuredâ€•, or â€œ¿insufficientlycognizant of unconscious processingâ€•.

The basis for this statement is the comparison made here of the results of an independent study of a series of congeners of LSD- 25 made by Isbell, Miner and Logan (3) in another laboratory, in a different milieu, and on a different population sample. It has been found that the comparative effective ness of a series of LSD congeners both at Cold Spring Harbor and at Isbell's laboratory in Lexington, Kentucky are the same when the Cold Spring Harbo...|$|R
40|$|Service-Oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) based applications {{have assumed}} widespread acceptance owing to their agility, maintainability and modularity. However, {{the safety and}} reliability of such loosely coupled systems entirely depend on the precision of service descriptions. Consequently any implicit assumption or unforeseen usage scenarios can lead to catastrophic fiascos. This is further exacerbated by the overlapping constructs and inconsistencies in Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), the de-facto industry standard for service composition. This paper extends the <b>Spring</b> framework to <b>devise</b> a verification framework for service composition wherein each BPEL activity is represented by a Java bean. The framework instantiates the beans corresponding to activities in a BPEL specification and injects the dependencies to yield a bean-factory. Thereafter Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) 2 APIs are used to transform the bean-factory into an XML based formal-model (e. g. Coloured Petri nets (CPN)) or an interchange format (e. g. Petri Net Markup Language (PNML)) for simulation and verification. In addition to automating the verification process, the proposed framework helps to combat the ad-hoc nature of existing solutions. Results indicate that the framework has an average transformation time of. 7 se...|$|R
