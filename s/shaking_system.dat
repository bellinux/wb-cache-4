In {{the past few years}} many efforts have been made to isolate pancreatic islets from large mammals in order to achieve valid and reproducible isolation methods. For several reasons swine may be considered an ideal source of islet tissue because of the similarity between human and porcine insulin and because of the easy availability of pig pancreata. Some papers have been published recently on this topic with good results. However, some problems, such as islet dissociation into single cells after collagenase digestion, are not completely solved.

40|$|Introduction Olive (Oleo europaea) {{includes}} about 20 {{species of}} small trees from Oleaceae family. This point {{should be considered}} that Iran has allocated only a small universal market to its olive products in spite of having high production potentials; so that about 23 provinces of this country can produce olive products. Therefore mechanizing of olive production and encouraging to develop olive trade are among the effective methods for development of this market. On the basis of IOOC report, the production of olive oil in 2008 - 2009 in Iran {{and all over the}} world has been 3 and 2866. 5 thousand tons, respectively. Currently, harvesting olive product is done by hand in Iran. The expensiveness of work force and providing the needed workers are considered as the biggest problem in olive harvesting. While harvesting the tall trees, the workers use beating method by wood sticks which causes the fruits to be damaged and their quality to be decreased. The harvesting method which {{the quality and quantity of}} the olive final products is under its effect and also high expenses of harvesting by hand are considered as the two important factors in developing the mechanical harvesting of olive. For this purpose, the mechanized harvesting of olive should be considered for producing olive conserve and olive oil and decreasing expenses of harvesting. Considering the conducted studies on one hand and shortage of informational resources in the country on the other hand, a research was designed and performed with the following purposes: Designing and fabricating of a portable pneumatic branch <b>shaking</b> <b>system.</b> Determining the best frequency and oscillation duration for harvesting olive by the constructed system. Materials and Methods The branch <b>shaking</b> <b>system</b> is made of two general parts: (a) The set of branch shaker driving unit. (b) The portable vibration arm. For constructing the set of vibrating arm, two experiments “elasticity and inflectionˮ of tree branches were conducted and the maximum force of 362. 40 N was registered and it was considered as the base of computations. Then a double-action pneumatic jack with the internal diameter of 32 mm and the rod diameter of 12 mm with the stroke length of 200 mm was selected. An electronic circuit was designed and developed for ordering the solenoid valve to control the flow. The system was transferred to one of the olive garden’s located in kilometer 5 of Sarvestan – Fasa road in Fars province in order to be evaluated. The effects of three oscillation frequencies of 12, 16 and 20 Hz and three oscillation durations of 5, 10 and 15 seconds at constant amplitude of 5 cm on detachment percentage of olive fruit was investigated through a factorial 3 × 3 experiment based on completely randomized design with four replications. Then the most suitable frequency and vibration duration was selected for harvesting olive by this system. For measuring the static detachment force of the fruits, a tensile force dynamometer system model FG- 5100 made by Lutron Company was used with the accuracy of 0. 1 N and a maximum capacity of 980 N. Results and Discussion The variance analysis of the investigated features on the basis of the factorial experiment based on completely randomized designs was conducted through using SPSS software. The results showed that both frequency of vibration and oscillation duration had significant effect on the shaker performance; with no significant interaction effects which implies the independence of the debated variables.

40|$|Heavy metal {{pollution}} in arable land {{has been a}} serious problem in Taiwan. Many reclamation methods like acid extraction or soil removing all cost lots of money. The most of the polluted heavy metals are deposited and associated with soil amorphus and crystal iron and manganese oxides which cause the low removal efficiency in acid extracting systems. Four experiments were conducted by supplying sugar carbon source, inorganic nutrients (ammonium sulphate and monopotasium sulphate), and yeast to two multi-heavy metals polluted soils to activate soils microorganism activites to lower soil pH and Eh for reducing soil iron and manganese oxides. The {{results showed that the}} addition of sugar dramatically decreased soil pH and Eh and cuased substantial amouts of soil inorganic components releases including fertility components, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn and heavy metals, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The results showed that during the incubation soil pH can be decreased to 4. 3, and the system redox potential lowered down to - 200 mV. The removal part of Ni, Zn, and Cu even reached 83. 6 %, 66. 6 %, and 46. 7 %, respectively. All results also evidenced by the reduced of heavy metals in forms with amorphus and crystal iron and manganese oxides and increased the more removal forms such as exchangeable and acid extractable forms. The removal efficeincy was increased with the addition of inorganic nutrients in addtion to the addition of sugar. The use of yeast reduced the removal efficiency of heavy metals by the higher soil pH and Eh, and lower chelating organic acids concentrations companying companying higher acetic acid concentration. The concentration of chelating organic acids can reach: citric acid, 0. 9 mM; oxalic acid, 0. 7 mM; malic acid, 2 mM; succinic acid 21 mM, Tartaric acid 3. 2 mM. The concentration of acetic acid in treatments adding with yeast reached 40 mM, the highest concentration for no yeast treatemnts reached 20 mM. Another evidence for supporting that the increasing the release of soil inorganic components release by addtion of sugar and inorganic nutrients are the decreases of soil organic matter content and cation exchangeable capacity. Results also illustrated that the removal efficieny of heavy metals is highest in static system, follwing the <b>shaking</b> <b>system,</b> the vacuum sucking system is lowest. 早期工業發展造成重金屬污染農田是不爭的事實。以往各項工程式的重金屬污染農田復育方式，酸洗、翻轉稀釋，均要花費大量金錢。但對於台灣中部受電鍍廢水污染農地的中酸性土壤，所含之重金屬以鐵錳氧化物結合型態存在，酸洗移除不易。試以提供碳源活化土壤中微生物相，並以厭氣孵育方式促進鐵、錳還原。 	本論文以四個試驗研究：一、探討碳源、無機養分及外來酵母添加對重金屬移除效果與土壤性質變化；二、比較震盪均勻混合與靜置處理上對重金屬型態變化之差異；三、以管柱試驗模擬現地處理重金屬型態與抽出量；四、土壤微生物所代謝之有機酸產量對土壤重金屬抽出量之影響。兩種試驗土壤取自彰化縣北部兩處受多種重金屬污染農田。 	結果顯示單獨添加蔗糖及再添加無機養分皆可降低土壤pH及氧化還原電位 (Eh) ，而促進重金屬及一些無機養分溶出，無機養分磷、鉀、鈣、鎂、鐵及錳溶出量高於一般肥力測定值。土壤pH在孵育其間下降至 4. 3 ，系統也處於還原狀態 200 mV~ - 200 mV，足以使鐵錳還原。重金屬的溶出以銅、鋅及鎳最顯著經由四星期孵育分別溶出可達 46. 7 %、 66. 6 %、 83. 6 %。加入蔗糖及無機養分 (氮、磷、鉀) 之處理結果優於只添加蔗糖處理。C/N 100 與C/N 50 之配方重金屬抽出量與有機酸產量略高。震盪與靜置比較試驗中發現，靜置處理對重金屬的溶出量較高，尤其磷、鐵及錳最明顯，鋅、銅及鎳次之。主要將與無定型(AmFe) 或結晶型(CyFe) 鐵錳結合之重金屬隨孵育試驗過程釋出，或形成交換態 (EC) 等弱鍵結態。管柱試驗因氧化與還原反覆交替，其重金屬溶出量遠比密閉處理低。添加酵母菌處理其土壤pH及Eh程度低於未添加處理，其重金屬及土壤養分成分釋出量亦較低。由有機酸測定顯示添加蔗糖及無機養分具有鉗合能力之有機酸含量個別高達：citric acid, 0. 9 mM; oxalic acid, 0. 7 mM; malic acid, 2 mM; succinic acid 21 mM, Tartaric acid 3. 2 mM。添加酵母菌處理其具鉗合力有機酸濃度較低而acetic acid濃度最高可達 40 mM，未添加酵母菌處理acetic acid也可高達 20 mM。經過四週孵育發現土壤有機質及土壤陽離子交換容量也明顯降低。中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the behavior of rigid foundations and structures resting on the surface or embedded in a cohesionless soil and subjected to transient active or passive excitations and forced vibrations using the centrifuge modeling technique. The {{investigation was}} aimed at studying both low and high amplitude vibrations of foundations under machine type loadings, earthquake or wave induced vibrations, and other sources of dynamic loads. Rigid "prototype" foundations of mass and size comparable to foundations of a low rise building were simulated in the centrifuge at a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g. Rigid model structures (aluminum towers) attached to foundations of different shapes, sizes, masses, and moments of inertia were tested. The effect of soil depth, boundary conditions, and depth of foundation embedment were investigated. Mainly rocking and horizontal modes of vibration were studied, The impulse rocking-horizontal excitation of the models was provided by actively perturbing the model structures using explosive energy or by passively exciting them by shaking the whole soil bucket using a hydraulic <b>shaking</b> <b>system.</b> The forced vibration was produced by a miniature air-driven counterrotating eccentric mass shaker mounted on the model structures. During the tests detailed measurements of the static and dynamic contact pressure distributions, displacement components of the model, and acceleration amplitudes at different elevations of the model structure were obtained. The acceleration ratios {{were used to determine}} the modes of vibration of the foundation systems. Natural frequencies and damping coefficients of the modes were calculated by f 1 tting the amplitude-frequency response of a single degree of freedom mass-spring dashpot oscillator to the experimental response curves derived from the test data. Experimental results provided information regarding the influence of different geometrical, inertial, and loading conditions on the vibrational characteristics of the soil-structure system. In particular the effect of foundation embedment was to increase the model resonant frequencies and to cause an appreciable change in contact pressure distribution underneath the footing. However, the resonant frequencies predicted by the lumped parameter analysis for a simple two-degree-of-freedom (rocking and translation) model were about 15 to 55 per cent higher than those measured experimentally. These results were approximately consistent with the comparisons made in similar theoretical and experimental studies such as those performed by Morris in the Cambridge centrifuge and those performed on full-scale footings by Stokoe and Richart. Damping ratios of the rocking-sliding vibration did not change considerably when footing size or depth of embedment changed. The existence of rigid boundaries around the soil mass in the bucket, and an inefficient contact between soil and the foundation side walls and lower surface could account for these observations. Uplift and nonlinear large amplitude vibrations were consistently observed during the steady-state vibration tests. Uplift led to a softer vibrating system which behaved non-linearly. As a result the frequency of vibration decreased with the amount of lift-off. In transient vibration uplift reduced the intensity of higher frequency vibration. Soil around the foundation edge yielded and plastic deformations and subsequent softening of the contact soil increased the material damping while it decreased the resonant frequency of the system. It was concluded that elastic half-space theory does not satisfy the needs for analysis of foundation behavior under high amplitude vibrations and more sophisticated methods of analysis are required...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of a {{structural}} <b>shake</b> table <b>system</b> is the accurate reproduction of acceleration records for testing. However, many systems deliver variable and less than optimal performance, particularly when reproducing large near-field seismic events that require extreme table performance. Improved identification and control methods are developed for large hydraulic servo-actuated <b>shake</b> table <b>systems</b> that can exhibit unacceptable tracking response for large, near-field seismic testing. The research {{is presented in the}} context of a 5 -tonne shake table facility at the University of Canterbury that is of typical design. The system is identified using a frequency response approach that accounts for the actual magnitudes and frequencies of motion encountered in seismic testing. The models and methods developed are experimentally verified and the impact of different feedback variables such as acceleration, velocity and displacement are examined. The methods show that shake table control in testing large near-field seismic events is often a trade off between accurate tracking and nonlinear velocity saturation of the hydraulic valves that can result in severe acceleration spikes. Control methods are developed to improve performance and include both acceleration and displacement feedback to reduce the acceleration spikes, and record modification, where the reference signal is modified to conform to the shake table’s operational parameters. Results show record modification gives exact tracking for near-field ground motions, and optimal system response for reference signals with velocity components greater then the system capabilities.

60|$|Mr. Brewster {{was not in}} one of his sunniest moods that morning. The {{proprietor}} of a large hotel has many things to disturb him, and to-day things had been going wrong. He had come up to his suite with the idea of restoring his <b>shaken</b> nerve <b>system</b> with a quiet cigar, and the sight of his son-in-law had, as so frequently happened, made him feel worse than ever. But, when Archie had descended from the chair and moved aside to allow him an uninterrupted view of the picture, Mr. Brewster realised that a worse thing had befallen him than a mere visit from one who always made him feel that the world was a bleak place.|$|R
30|$|Monitoring {{of culture}} {{conditions}} in the headspace of shake-flasks using the OTR-Device (Anderlei and Büchs 2001) and RAMOS [Respiration Activity Monitoring System] (Anderlei et al. 2004) has been reported previously. These devices measure the oxygen transfer rate and respiration activity, respectively. However, these systems do not directly monitor CO 2 and O 2 in the headspace of Erlenmeyer flasks with breathable culture plugs during microbial cell culture. The BCpreFerm system for shake-flasks (BlueSens, Herten, NW FRG) is an online monitoring device for <b>shaken</b> culture <b>systems,</b> which can be equipped with standard culture plugs. However, this device can monitor only in the gas phase of shake-flasks, and the sampling operation involves temporary interruption of shaking.|$|R
