50|$|Insofar as {{the lateral}} force {{is the one}} acting {{side-to-side}} along the tire axle, lateral force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the lateral force will change. As the tire rotates it may exert a lateral force {{on the order of}} 25 pounds, causing <b>steering</b> <b>pull</b> in one direction. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 22 pounds and 26 pounds would be characterized as a 4-pound lateral force variation, or LFV. LFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described above. Lateral force is signed, such that when mounted on the vehicle, the lateral force may be positive, making the vehicle pull to the left, or negative, pulling to the right.|$|E
50|$|The safety car {{was called}} out almost {{immediately}} to clear Ricciardo's stricken Red Bull car {{and clean up}} oil from the track surface. The safety car went in {{at the end of}} lap 5, and shortly after the restart Vettel started to notice his <b>steering</b> <b>pulling</b> left on the straights. He was instructed to avoid the kerbs and his lap times started to increase, allowing teammate Kimi Räikkönen and the two Mercedes to catch up.|$|R

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{steering}} engine {{which is}} an electro-hydraulic motor-driven winch that takes directions from the <b>steering</b> wheel and <b>pulls</b> a <b>steering</b> cable connected through pulleys to the tug's rudder from port to starboard.|$|R
5000|$|A skilled driver {{can control}} the {{movement}} of the car even while skidding by <b>steering,</b> throttling and <b>pulling</b> the hand brake (given that the hand brake operates the rear wheels as in most cases, with some Citroen and Saab models being notable exceptions).|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{cylinders}} {{are fundamental}} components of hydraulic machinery. The {{function of a}} hydraulic cylinder is to convert the hydrostatic power of a fluid into mechanical power. They are the actuators or muscles of heavy equipment providing motion and force including <b>steering,</b> suspension, pushing, <b>pulling,</b> lifting, lowering, tilting, extending, clamping, stabilizing, and so on.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Storm Ignacio formed {{first as}} a {{depression}} {{in an area of}} disturbed weather on August 17. Twelvehours later, it organized into a tropical storm. Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop. <b>Steering</b> currents <b>pulled</b> Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio never intensified beyond 40mph (65km/h) and then was downgraded into a depression on August 18. It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours later. It was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 October 1944, four U.S. Army {{divisions}} aboard 650 U.S. Navy vessels {{landed at}} Palo, Leyte, fulfilling MacArthur's promise {{to return to}} the Philippines. On 13 December, the Japanese began evacuating civilians and non-essentials from Manila aboard Oryoku Maru and four other merchant ships. As the ship was heading for Japan, fighter aircraft from the aircraft carrier [...] attacked the ships and left hundred of Japanese dead or wounded. Oryoku Maru, heavily damaged with destroyed <b>steering</b> gear, <b>pulled</b> into Subic Bay. Throughout the night, the Japanese disembarked while the American and Allied prisoners, that were carried below decks, were left aboard.|$|R
2500|$|The boat left Wusong on October 1, passing Hankou (the last [...] "western" [...] {{city on the}} route) on October 11. At Yichang Settle disembarked, {{leaving the}} boat and its crew to prepare for forcing the rapids, and himself took a {{reconnaissance}} trip to Chongqing on a British steamer. He returned just as the water level fell below optimum, and immediately ordered departure. Balancing engine thrust, <b>steering,</b> and <b>pulling</b> the boat by cables, and struggling to avoid downstream-bound junks, Settle managed to get Palos through the rocky rapids. On November 12, 1934, Palos reached Chongqing where it was eventually decommissioned in 1937; the hulk was still afloat in 1939.|$|R
50|$|Torque {{steering}} is {{the influence}} of engine torque on the steering, especially in front-wheel drive vehicles with transversely mounted engines. For example, during heavy acceleration the <b>steering</b> may <b>pull</b> to one side, which may be disturbing to the driver. The effect is manifested either as a tugging sensation in the steering wheel, or a veering of the vehicle from the intended path. Torque steer {{is directly related to}} differences in the forces in the contact patches of the left and right drive wheels. The effect becomes more evident when high torques are applied to the drive wheels either because of a high overall reduction ratio between the engine and wheels, high engine torque, or some combination of the two. Torque steering is distinct from steering kickback.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the <b>steering</b> wheel, door <b>pulls,</b> and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Human beings perform complex tasks while even keeping balance. Though this {{is evident}} for a human, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to adapt human motion to humanoid robots, due to the posture redundancy. In this paper we propose a conceptually simple framework of human posture control, scoping in a general way with grasp, task achievement and being on the same time robust to external disturbances. We do this by establishing physically meaningful constraints on the force level. In order to respect all constraints, we solve for a quadratic minimization problem (quadratic programming), yielding the required joint torque controls. Contrarily to most other approaches, we deal also with unilateral contacts (due to friction) as well as bilateral grasps which allow for example for arbitrarily <b>steering</b> or <b>pulling</b> on a handhold. Additionally, and in contrast to classical methods based on ZMP, we account also for contacts not all being in the same plane, as hand-wall contact.

2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid to prevent nosing over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a <b>steering</b> wheel <b>pulling</b> on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece.

5000|$|It {{is viewed}} by many that when used with Gran Turismo 4 it {{provides}} an experience very comparable to actual racing. This is mostly due to the force feedback feature which causes the <b>steering</b> wheel to <b>pull</b> back on the individual turning it, if the user attempts to turn the wheel in a way a real car [...] "wouldn't want to go;" [...] a counter-resistance — [...] "pushing back" [...] against drivers' initial attempts to turn it, based on the speed, inertia, energy, and geometry of the car, and what surface you are driving on. It will provide sharp, smooth and clean resistance effects on dry pavement, less resistance on wet pavement, and almost none on snow and ice. On a dirt or gravel track, it will vibrate erratically to give the sensation of actually driving on these surfaces. A minor feature, like the DualShock 2 controller, is vibrating when clipping {{the side of the}} road or some other object. The wheel generates a sudden jerk when hitting any object. If the driver goes over a bump, the wheel will jolt like in a real car. The close collaboration between the wheel and game development teams ensured that maximum use was made of the hardware's capabilities.|$|R
6000|$|He {{caused his}} 'sister' {{to be called}} repeatedly, {{and when she came}} down, {{explained}} with a humorous smile his legal relationship to the bicycle in the yard. [...] "Might be disagreeable, y' know." [...] His anxiety was obvious enough. [...] "Very well," [...] she said (quite friendly); [...] "hurry breakfast, and we'll ride out. I want to talk things over with you." [...] The girl seemed more beautiful than ever after the night's sleep; her hair in comely dark waves from her forehead, her ungauntleted finger-tips pink and cool. And how decided she was! Breakfast was a nervous ceremony, conversation fraternal but thin; the waiter overawed him, and he was cowed by a multiplicity of forks. But she called him [...] "Chris." [...] They discussed their route over his sixpenny county map for the sake of talking, but avoided a decision {{in the presence of the}} attendant. The five-pound note was changed for the bill, and through Hoopdriver's determination to be quite the gentleman, the waiter and chambermaid got half a crown each and the ostler a florin. [...] "'Olidays," [...] said the ostler to himself, without gratitude. The public mounting of the bicycles in the street was a moment of trepidation. A policeman actually stopped and watched them from the opposite kerb. Suppose him to come across and ask: [...] "Is that your bicycle, sir?" [...] Fight? Or drop it and run? It was a time of bewildering apprehension, too, going through the streets of the town, so that a milk cart barely escaped destruction under Mr. Hoopdriver's chancy wheel. That recalled him to a sense of erratic <b>steering,</b> and he <b>pulled</b> himself together. In the lanes he breathed freer, and a less formal conversation presently began.|$|R
