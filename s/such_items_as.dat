5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. <b>Such</b> <b>items</b> <b>as</b> tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E

The feud between The Undertaker and Schyster escalated when Schyster performed a series of vignettes in which he repossessed <b>such</b> <b>items</b> <b>as</b> tombstones and burial plots from people he claimed had not paid their taxes before dying. During the feud, Schyster was escorted to the ring for his matches by a group of hooded druids.|$|E
5|$|Padayappa was {{released}} on 10 April 1999 {{on the eve of}} Tamil New Year's day. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide without the involvement of distributors. It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints, and 700,000 audio cassettes. The film's rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking <b>such</b> <b>items</b> <b>as</b> beedis, cigarettes, cheroots and tobacco, making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry. The pre-release business of the film's overseas rights amounted to 30 million. According to an estimate by trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai, the value of the theatrical and satellite rights for Padayappa was approximately 20 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, in the {{years prior to the}} war basic defence industries had been established in Australia for the production of uniforms, webbing, boots, small arms and explosives and ammunition. Despite this, the majority of the equipment initially issued came from British Army stocks until Australian production was able to be increased to meet the demand that resulted from rapid military expansion {{at the start of the}} war. These included <b>such</b> <b>items</b> <b>as</b> heliographs, water bottles, bits, stirrups, spurs and shovels, although saddlery and harnesses were provided by a local government manufacturer. Although Australia had a relatively limited industrial base during the war, it was ultimately able to supply the majority of the Army's more simple requirements; however, the remainder of the more complex equipment had to be purchased from suppliers in Britain.|$|E
