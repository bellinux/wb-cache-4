5000|$|Due to {{personal}} and financial disagreements that {{arose in the}} wake of his completion of The Atlantis Trilogy, Sechi sold his shares in Bard Games to Cordovano and left. Over the next three months he began work on another trilogy of supplements that would form the basis of a new RPG; Cordovano decided that he did not want to run Bard Games and solid it back to Sechi, who now had a publishing house to produce his new game which he called Talislanta (1987) [...] The success of Talislanta allowed Sechi to collect his Atlantis <b>setting</b> <b>material</b> into a new sourcebook, Atlantis: The Lost World (1988) and shortly afterward could publish a second edition of the Talislanta game in the Talislanta Handbook & Campaign Guide (1989). When a buyer from Waldenbooks placed a huge order on Atlantis: The Lost World, Sechi was reluctant to fill it but eventually did; about a year later many of the books were returned, forcing Bard Games to refund about $20,000. Sechi repaid its debts to the book trade, paid off his partner, and then shut Bard Games down. Sechi retained control of Bard Games' properties, and licensed the rights to Wizards of the Coast, Death's Edge Games, Daedalus Entertainment, and Pharos Press.|$|E
