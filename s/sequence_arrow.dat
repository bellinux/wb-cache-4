40|$|Musical {{imagery is}} a {{relatively}} unexplored area, partly because of deficiencies in existing experimental paradigms, which are often difficult, unreliable, or do not provide objective measures of performance. Here we describe a novel protocol, the Pitch Imagery Arrow Task (PIAT), which induces and trains pitch imagery in both musicians and non-musicians. Given a tonal context and an initial pitch <b>sequence,</b> <b>arrows</b> are displayed to elicit a scale-step sequence of imagined pitches, and participants indicate whether the final imagined tone matches an audible probe. It is a staircase design that accommodates individual differences in musical experience and imagery ability. This new protocol was used to investigate the roles that musical expertise, self-reported auditory vividness and mental control play in imagery performance. Performance on the task was significantly better for participants who employed a musical imagery strategy compared to participants who used an alternative cognitive strategy and positively correlated with scores on the Control subscale from the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale (BAIS). Multiple regression analysis revealed that Imagery performance accuracy was best predicted {{by a combination of}} strategy use and scores on the Vividness subscale of BAIS. These results confirm that competent performance on the PIAT requires active musical imagery and is very difficult to achieve using alternative cognitive strategies. Auditory vividness and mental control were more important than musical experience in the ability to perform manipulation of pitch imagery. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSkill in archery {{directly}} {{depends on}} {{the interaction between the}} subject, the bow and the arrow when shooting. Researches in biomechanics of archery have frequently described the different coordination and muscular activation during the shoot of the subject. Few of them describe the influence of the bow (mechanical characteristics, stabilizers, etc.) on the subject’s skill and physical capacities. The aim of the study is to compare the influence of two bows on the subject’s skill. An international level archer shot a <b>sequence</b> of twelve <b>arrows</b> (A 1) X 10, 380 (Easton) and a <b>sequence</b> of twelve <b>arrows</b> (A 2) X 10 Pro Tour, 380 (Easton). Each <b>sequence</b> of <b>arrows</b> were shot with two bows (B 1 : 27 inch Inno carbon bow handle associated with 70 inch and 38 lb bow limb; B 2 : 25 inch Inno bow carbon handle associated with 70 inch and 40 lb bow limb). All archers’ shots were performed on a 70  m distant target. For each arrow, heights at shot (H 1) and on the target (H 2) were measured. The velocity (km. h− 1) of the arrow was recorded using Stalker ATS radar when it left the bow. The angle (α) between the arrow and the horizontal axis was estimated using the previous measurement and the Newton’s law. Multi-varied Anova test was used to define the influence of bows and arrows on the shot parameter (V) and archer’s skill (α, H 2). Results show that the use of the B 2 A 2 condition would be the less interesting for this archer’s skill in order to perform the centre of the target. Indeed, H 2 with B 2 A 2 condition is usually 10 cm above the centre of the target. The use of the B 2 A 1 condition could permit the archer to perform the centre of the target as accurately as the B 1 conditions. When using B 2 A 1 condition, a shot is realised with smaller velocity (219 ± 0. 3 versus 226 ± 0  km. h− 1) and bigger angle α (5. 45 ± 0. 3 versus 5. 16 ± 0. 03 degree). For this archer, B 2 A 1 condition could help him to reach the centre of the target with less energy to bend the bow and shoot with less velocity, and bigger range of angle when shooting (0. 6 versus 0. 08 degree) ...|$|R

A diagram technique have been developed for it that consists in: 1) the numeration of the matrix elements by points of the 2 D diagram with coordinates (l, k), 2) the drawing arrows between points of this diagram corresponding to the action of the annihilation operators on the wave functions; 3) total taking into account of all possible path vectors formed by the continuous <b>sequences</b> of <b>arrows</b> from point (v, v) towards points (0, k). The only requirement is that the action of the operator on the wave functions should give the wave functions of the Schrödinger equation with the potential curve having the same parameter values. All necessary data for algebraic calculations of the vibrational dependence of matrix elements for the harmonic oscillator and the Morse potential have been given. Obtained expressions can be used to determine the absolute values and vibrational dependences of various spectroscopic characteristics of both ground and electronically excited states of diatomic molecules.

40|$|Rat {{intestinal}} mucin Muc 3 (rMuc 3), {{like its}} human homologue (MUC 3) {{and several other}} membrane mucins, contains a C-terminally located SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin) module, with an intrinsic proteolytic site <b>sequence</b> G downward <b>arrow</b> SIVV (where G downward arrow S is the glycine serine cleavage site). As shown previously [Wang, Khatri and Forstner (2002) Biochem. J. 366, 623 - 631], expression of the C-terminal domain of rMuc 3 in COS- 1 cells yields a V 5 epitope-tagged N-terminal glycopeptide of 30 kDa and a Myc- and His epitope-tagged C-terminal glycopeptide of 49 kDa. The present study shows that the 49 kDa membrane-anchored fragment undergoes a further cleavage reaction which decreases its size to 30 kDa. Western blotting, pulse-chase metabolic incubations, immunoprecipitation and deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F were used to detect and identify the proteolytic products. Both {{the first and second}} cleavages are presumed to facilitate solubilization of Muc 3 at the apical surface of enterocytes and/or enhance the potential for Muc 3 to participate in ligand-receptor and signal transduction events for enterocyte function in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Although human MUC 3 and rodent Muc 3 {{are both}} membrane-associated {{intestinal}} mucins, {{the present study}} has explored the possibility that rodent Muc 3 might exist in soluble as well as membrane forms. No evidence was obtained {{for the existence of}} soluble splice variants; however, experiments with heterologous cells transfected with cDNA encoding the 381 -residue C-terminal domain of rodent Muc 3 showed that a definitive proteolytic cleavage occurs during processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The products consisted of a V 5 -tagged 30 kDa extracellular glycopeptide and a Myc-tagged 49 kDa membrane-associated glycopeptide. Throughout their cellular transport to the plasma membrane, the two fragments remained associated by non-covalent SDS-sensitive interactions. Site-specific mutagenesis pinpointed the need for glycine and serine residues in the cleavage sequence Leu-Ser-Lys-Gly-Ser-Ile-Val-Val, which is localized between the two epidermal-growth-factor-like motifs of the mucin. A similar cleavage <b>sequence</b> (Phe-Arg-Pro-Gly downward <b>arrow</b> Ser-Val-Val-Val, where downward arrow signifies the cleavage site) has been reported in human MUC 1 and analogous sites are present in human MUC 3, MUC 12 and MUC 17.

40|$|Fluorogenic {{peptides}} encompassing {{the processing}} sites of envelope glycoproteins of the infectious influenza A Hong Kong virus (HKV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) were tested for cleavage by soluble recombinants of the proprotein convertases furin, PC 5 and PC 7. Kinetic studies with these intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides revealed selective cleavages at the physiological dibasic sites. The HKV peptide is cleaved by both furin and PC 5 with similar efficacy; in comparison, PC 7 cleaves this substrate poorly. In contrast with the basic tetrapeptide insertion within the haemagglutinin sequence of HKV, two other dipeptide insertions revealed a poorer cleavage with a similar rank order of potency. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal RERR insertion to the wild-type avian RKKR downward <b>arrow</b> <b>sequence</b> is functionally significant, and suggest that the approx. 5 -fold increase in cleavage efficacy contributes to the high infectivity of the H 5 N 1 virus subtype. With regard to RSV peptide processing, PC 7 is twice as effective as PC 5 and furin. The EBOV peptide was processed with similar efficiency by the three enzymes. Our observations {{that all of these}} cleavages can be effectively inhibited by a plant andrographolide derivative at 250 microM or less might aid in the design of potent convertase inhibitors as alternative antiviral therapies...|$|R
5000|$|These {{ideas were}} {{taken up by}} various {{followers}} of Parmenides, most notably Melissus and Zeno, who provided additional arguments, specifically for the impossibility of motion. Melissus claimed that reality was [...] "full" [...] (nonexistence being impossible), and that therefore nothing could move. Zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential. Among the simplest was his observation that to move from A to B, one must first reach the halfway point between A and B; but then {{in order to do}} this, one must get halfway from A to this halfway point; and so on. Thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps, which Zeno held to be impossible. A similar argument involved a footrace between Achilles and a tortoise. The tortoise is given a headstart. Achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood, but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little, so Achilles must now reach this new point, and so on. A different argument involved the flight of an arrow. Zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time, the arrow is not moving in that moment. He then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise {{as the result of a}} <b>sequence</b> of motionless <b>arrows.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceMacrophage elastase, or MMP- 12, {{is mainly}} {{produced}} by alveolar macrophages and {{is believed to}} play a major role in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The catalytic domain of MMP- 12 is unique among MMPs in that it is very highly active on numerous substrates including elastin. However, measuring MMP- 12 activity in biological fluids has been hampered by the lack of highly selective substrates. We therefore synthesized four series of fluorogenic peptide substrates based on the sequences of MMP- 12 cleavage sites in its known substrates. Human MMP- 12 efficiently cleaved peptide substrates containing a Pro at P 3 in the <b>sequence</b> ProX-X down <b>arrow</b> Leu but lacked selectivity towards these substrates compared to other MMPs, including MMP- 2, MMP- 7, MMP- 9 and MMP- 13. On the contrary, the substrate Abz-RNALAVERTAS-EDDnp derived from the CXCR 5 chemokine was the most selective substrate for MMP- 12 ever reported. All substrates were cleaved more efficiently by full-length MMP- 12 than by its catalytic domain alone, indicating that the C-terminal hemopexin domain influences substrate binding and/or catalysis. Docking experiments revealed unexpected interactions between the peptide substrate Abz-RNALAVERTAS-EDDn and MMP- 12 residues. Most of our substrates were poorly cleaved by murine MMP- 12 suggesting that human and murine MMP- 12 have different substrate specificities despite their structural similarity...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, great {{progress}} has been made in characterizing the accumulation of neural information during simple unitary perceptual decisions. However, much less is known about how sequentially presented evidence is integrated over time for successful decision making. The aim of this study was to study the mechanisms of sequential decision making in humans. In a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we presented healthy volunteers with sequences of centrally presented <b>arrows.</b> <b>Sequence</b> length varied between one and five arrows, and the accumulated directions of the arrows informed the subject about which hand to use for a button press at the end of the sequence (e. g., LRLRR should result in a right-hand press). Mathematical modeling suggested that nonlinear accumulation was the rational strategy for performing this task in the presence of no or little noise, whereas quasilinear accumulation was optimal in the presence of substantial noise. MEG recordings showed a correlate of evidence integration over parietal and central cortex that was inversely related to the amount of accumulated evidence (i. e., when more evidence was accumulated, neural activity for new stimuli was attenuated). This modulation of activity likely reflects a top–down influence on sensory processing, effectively constraining the influence of sensory information on the decision variable over time. The results indicate that, when making decisions on the basis of sequential information, the human nervous system integrates evidence in a nonlinear manner, using the amount of previously accumulated information to constrain the accumulation of additional evidence. ...|$|R
