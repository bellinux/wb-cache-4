30|$|In summary, the {{contribution}} of this work is that it investigates collaborative detection schemes between pairs of closely <b>spaced</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes and shows that the choice of which scheme to use should depend on {{the distance between the}} nodes. Furthermore, for the different detection schemes considered in this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of their performance both in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities as well as coverage. A shorter version of this work introducing the different collaborative detection schemes has appeared in [14]. Our results indicate that the proposed hybrid detection scheme (the ECD) combines the strengths of the ED and the CD and achieves the best coverage for closely <b>spaced</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes.|$|R

50|$|The Pirinclik (near Diyarbakir, Turkey) {{intelligence}} collection radar site ultimately consisted of one detection radar (FPS-17) and one mechanical tracking radar (FPS-79). The Pirinclik radars were {{operated by the}} 19th Surveillance Squadron. The FPS-17 radar reached IOC on 1 June 1955 and the FPS-79 in 1964. Both radars operated at a UHF (432 MHz) frequency. Although limited by their mechanical technology, Pirinclik's two radars gave the advantage of tracking two objects simultaneously in real time. Its location close to the southern Former Soviet Union made it the only ground sensor capable of tracking actual deorbits of Russian space objects.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In {{the next}} decades, JAXA plan {{to launch a}} series of GCOM {{satellite}}s.

The successful calibration and validation of <b>space</b> <b>sensors</b> (such as SGLI) is crucially important and is depending on many factors, such as rigid ground-truth campaigns, the validation of the product algorithms. Also the transfer of ADEOS- 2 GLI algorithms to the SGLI project needs a special validation effort.

40|$|Abstract—A <b>space</b> <b>sensor</b> often {{consists}} {{of a number of}} dies integrated side-by-side on a single substrate of package due to its high-resolution requirement. The sensing areas of these dies often cannot align both vertically and horizontally. This problem could cause serious image distortion if not handled properly. Trying to fix this problem at the base station on the earth is less effective since the expanded image data would have been too overwhelming. To overcome this problem, a low-cost built-in self-repair scheme is proposed in this paper. The misalignment amount at each die-to-die boundary is first decided continually, and then used to repair the distorted image on-the-fly right before they are stored into the image buffer. Experiments on a large number of test images indicate that a repair rate of almost 100 % is achievable at only 2. 43 % area overhead.

In both models, error exponents take on simple forms involving {{the parameters of the}} Markov process and expectations over Fd of certain functions of d 1.
