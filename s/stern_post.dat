5|$|The Texas Antiquities Committee {{sponsored}} a travelling {{exhibition of the}} finds from the 1554 wreck from 1977 to 1981, which visited 20 museums across Texas. The exhibition showed an anchor, cannons and the remaining parts of the keel and <b>stern</b> <b>post.</b> Display cases held explanatory text, illustrations and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E
50|$|Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, {{the hull}} was of {{composite}} construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking.|$|R
60|$|Having {{laid the}} keel firmly {{on a bed}} of wooden blocks, in such a {{position}} that the ship when finished may slide into the water stern foremost, the shipbuilder proceeds next to erect the stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The six-oar, four-oar and two-oar yals {{have one}} mast {{used to support}} two quadlilateral {{standing}} split-lug sails. Wooden yals are constructed of oak keels, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> ash thwarts and gratings, and pine or laminated glued spruce strakes.|$|R
25|$|By 1905, the Roanoke {{was serving}} ports in California and Oregon. On November 27, 1905, the ship lost its rudder and <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> while {{crossing}} the harbor bar at Eureka, California in heavy seas during an ebb tide.|$|E
25|$|Having {{considering}} the DC-8 Super Sixties and the Lockheed L-1011, Air New Zealand ordered eight DC-10-30s, {{the first of}} which arrived on 27 January 1973. The DC-10s introduced a new paint scheme, with a koru featuring on the tail in the style of a Maori waka (canoe) <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> instead of the previously displayed Southern Cross; this scheme spread to the DC-8s during 1973. The longer range of the DC-10 opened up routes to Asia and eliminated the stop at Manila on the Auckland to Hong Kong route in 1975. As well as expanding trans-Pacific services. The first service to Perth was started in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Dufferin was 108.0 ft (length from {{fore part}} of stem, under the bowsprit, to the aft {{side of the}} head of the <b>stern</b> <b>post),</b> 25.0 ft (main breadth to outside of plating), 8.6 ft (depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling at midships), and 28.0 ft (length of engine room). Dufferin had a gross tonnage of 210.57 and a {{registered}} tonnage of 98.93. She was equipped with a Scottish compound surface condensing engine 0.20 Cylinder. 15” & 32” – 24” 42 N.H.P. (nominal horsepower). Additionally, Dufferin had two masts with auxiliary schooner rigging to supplement the steam engine. Furthermore, she had wooden framework with a carvel build, and a elliptical stern.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, {{the hull}} was of {{composite}} construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. The entire class were re-classified in November 1884 as sloops before they entered service.|$|R
50|$|The weakest {{part of an}} {{enlarged}} hulk would be its stem and stern. Since it has no proper keel or substantial stem or <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> {{those parts of the}} boat would have to be reinforced by the introduction of substantial aprons and breasthooks, perhaps augmented by sacrificial stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> between which the unsupported hull planking could be sandwiched. Early hulks, like all of the other northern boat types, were initially shell-built using lapstrake or clinker planking which was subsequently reinforced by the insertion of grown crooks of timber as frames. Using these techniques, perhaps better understood as a result of technological transfers from architectural woodworking, shipwrights were able to extend the hulk in size until it rivaled and surpassed the cog.|$|R
50|$|Other {{large and}} {{difficult}} jobs taken on by Thurlow Works included castings for ship anchors, <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> for battleships and large industrial housings. In 1893, the company {{became the first}} in the United States to manufacture a complete cast steel frame for a locomotive, built for the Baldwin Locomotive Works.|$|R
25|$|The ship {{experienced}} some problems during her long journey. On 26 July 1889, {{she entered the}} Suez Canal and ran ashore in Great Bitter Lake, destroyed the <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> and lost the rudder. After repairs, Ertuğrul set sail again on 23 September. While sailing in western Indian Ocean, the ship took on water from the bow. The crew was unable to conduct the necessary repairs until they reached Singapore. Ertuğrul was repaired in Singapore and departed on 22 March 1890. After a ten-day stop in Saigon, she arrived in Yokohama on 7 June 1890. The journey from Constantinople lasted around eleven months. Captain Ali Osman Bey was promoted {{to the rank of}} (Commodore/Rear Admiral) during the journey.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward of the <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|E
500|$|U-255 sailed from Neidenfjord on 13 September 1942, {{patrolling the}} Barents Sea, with no result, {{before heading out}} into the Greenland Sea. There, on 20 September, she {{attacked}} the 4,937 ton American merchant ship Silver Sword, returning from Arkhangelsk to New York with 5,000 tons of hides and chrome ore and a deck cargo of wood pulp. Hit by two torpedoes, which blew off the <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> propeller and rudder, and caused the after magazine to explode, the 48 crew and 16 passengers (survivors from PQ 17) abandoned ship in two lifeboats and one raft. The ship was then shelled by the W class destroyer [...] and sank. The crew were later picked up by British ships, with one man dying of wounds later.|$|E
50|$|The two deck steamer {{was laid}} down in July 1917 by the National Shipbuilding Company of Orange, Texas as Hull No. 245. Shortages of {{materials}} meant that she was wooden-hulled, with a steel keelson, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> of oak, and timbers largely of yellow pine. This was due to shortages of metals. SS Argenta was launched in May 1919.|$|R
50|$|The {{sides of}} the Delaware River Durhams were {{vertical}} with a slight curvature to meet a similar curvature of the bottom which was otherwise flat. The sides were straight and parallel until they began to curve to the stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> about twelve or fourteen feet from the ends, where the decks began, {{the rest of the}} boat being open.|$|R
50|$|The hulk (OE:hulc) {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century, when it is distinguished from a keel (OE:ceol), a ship in keeled longship tradition such as the knarr. Although clinker-built, the distinguishing feature of hulks were {{that they had no}} stem or <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> or deep keel, being flat bottomed like a cog. Early images of hulks show them strongly curved upwards at stem and stern.|$|R
500|$|By July, it was {{becoming}} obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance, which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley {{to be prepared to}} quickly abandon ship if the need arose. Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: [...] "You seriously mean to tell me that the ship is doomed?" [...] Shackleton responded [...] "The ship can't live in this, Skipper." [...] Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later. [...] Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, [...] to the northeast. After just three days, {{it was clear that the}} condition of the ice was too rough for sledging. Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4km) from where the Endurance was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established. [...] The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.|$|E
500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} our ship had been so fearfully mauled that she looked like little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|E
2500|$|... albitana: 1) Fence {{to protect}} plants in gardening. 2) Prolongation of the keel or <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> of a ship. From Arabic al-bitana.|$|E
5000|$|Sparrow was {{launched}} on 26 September 1889 at Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Greenock. [...] Her triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine {{was built by}} the Greenock Foundry, and developed 1,200 indicated horsepower, sufficient to propel her at 13 kn through her single screw. Her hull was of composite construction, that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. She was rigged as a barquentine.|$|R
5000|$|The Redbreast {{class were}} {{designed}} by Sir William Henry White, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction in 1888. [...] The hull was of composite construction, that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. These were the last class of composite-hulled gunboats built for the Royal Navy - the next class of gunboat, the Bramble-class gunboat of 1898, was of steel construction.|$|R
50|$|The Bramble {{class was}} {{designed}} by William White. The ships were of composite construction, meaning that the iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> were of iron, while the hull was planked with timber. This {{had the advantage of}} allowing the vessels to be coppered, thus keeping marine growth under control, a problem that caused iron-hulled ships to be frequently docked. They were 165 ft in length and displaced 715 tons.|$|R
2500|$|Length between perpendiculars (LBP or LPP) is {{the length}} of the summer load {{waterline}} from the <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> {{to the point where it}} crosses the stem. (see also p/p) ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{problem is}} that {{especially}} wooden ships {{have more than one}} [...] "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the [...] "length of the topmost deck" [...] – the [...] "length on deck" [...] (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> on deck level' or the [...] "length between perpendiculars" [...] (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including jibboom and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The largest length for comparing ships, the total [...] "overall" [...] length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> of a Drummond!" [...] exclaimed the armourer; [...] "conscience, man, it {{will put}} you in feud with the whole clan--not the least wrathful in the country, as I take it." ...|$|E
50|$|The Ariel-class gunboat was a {{class of}} nine 4-gun {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy between 1871 and 1873. Although most were sold by 1890, one of them survived into the 1920s as a salvage vessel in private ownership. They were the first class of Royal Navy gunboat built of composite construction, that is, with iron keel, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> and iron framing, but planked with wood.|$|R
50|$|The boats {{equipped}} with a sudu were referred to as bedar luang sudu (English: spare spoon) or bedar sudu itek (English: duck's bill)The conspicuous sheer (ship) of the bedar varied as well. The smaller ones with a long projection having more sheer and the bigger ones with a short sudu and short sheer. Bedars above 70 feet rarely carried a long sudu but featured almost straight stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> {{very much like the}} bedar Dapat.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, {{the hull}} was of {{composite}} construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. This class of composite sloops was unique in having an internal steel deck over the machinery and magazines for protection. Propulsion {{was provided by}} a horizontal compound-expansion steam engine of [...] driving a single screw. All the ships of the class were built with a barque rig.|$|R
60|$|They {{worked for}} a time, and then Bill {{returned}} on deck to fetch two more hands. They brought hand spikes and bars, as the bales were wedged so tightly together that it was difficult, in the extreme, to move them. It took two hours' hard work before they reached the leak. As the captain had supposed, {{the head of one}} of the planks had been started, at the <b>stern</b> <b>post,</b> by a blow from the wreck of the mizzen; and the water was rushing in with great force.|$|E
60|$|Reuben at once set to work, {{cutting a}} deep groove in the <b>stern</b> <b>post.</b> He butted some stout {{pieces of wood}} into this, and wedged the other ends firmly against the first rib. Then he set to work to jam down sail cloth and oakum between this barrier and the plank that had started, driving it down with a marlinespike and mallet. It was a long job, but it was {{securely}} done; and at last Reuben had the satisfaction of seeing that a mere driblet of water was making its way down, behind the stuffing, into the ship.|$|E
60|$|But we are {{not done}} with that engine yet. The engine is powerful. We are two small men and a small woman. It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand. Let the engine do it. And then comes {{the problem of how}} to convey power for'ard from the engine to the winch. And by the time all this is settled, we {{redistribute}} the allotments of space to the engine-room, galley, bath-room, state-rooms, and cabin, and begin all over again. And when we have shifted the engine, I send off a telegram of gibberish to its makers at New York, something like this: Toggle-joint abandoned change thrust-bearing accordingly distance from forward side of flywheel to face of <b>stern</b> <b>post</b> sixteen feet six inches.|$|E
50|$|The Forester-class gunboat was a {{class of}} 4-gun {{composite}} gunboats built for the Royal Navy between 1874 and 1877. Although half had been sold by 1890, the rest survived into the 20th century as coal hulks, base vessels and other secondary uses. Foxhound survived as a hulk on the Blackwall Reach of the Thames until 1975, when she was broken up. They were built of composite construction, that is, with iron keel, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> and iron framing, but planked with wood.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, {{the hull}} was of {{composite}} construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts</b> with wooden planking. This class of composite sloops was unique in having an internal steel deck over the machinery and magazines for protection. The Satellite class were reclassified as corvettes in 1884, {{and no more}} composite or wooden corvettes were built - in fact, Pylades was the last corvette built for the Royal Navy until the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Currachs {{in general}} {{adhere to a}} plan {{designed}} to produce a sturdy, light and versatile vessel. The framework consists of latticework formed of rib-frames ("hoops") and stringers (longitudinal slats), surmounted by a gunwale. There are stem and <b>stern</b> <b>posts,</b> but no keel. Thwarts are fitted, with knees supplied as required. Cleats or thole pins are fitted for the oars, {{and there may be}} a mast and sail, though with a minimum of rigging. The outside of the hull is covered by tarred canvas or calico, a substitute for animal hide.|$|R
