5|$|The Other Woman is a 2014 American comedy film {{directed}} by Nick Cassavetes and written by Melissa <b>Stack.</b> <b>The</b> film stars Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Nicki Minaj and Taylor Kinney appear in supporting roles. The film follows three womenCarly (Diaz), Kate (Mann), and Amber (Upton)who are all romantically {{involved with the}} same man, Mark (Coster-Waldau). After finding out about each other, the trio take revenge on Mark.|$|E
5|$|The hall has thick flint walls, gabled cross wings, with a Gothic stone {{arch and}} 20th century boarded door and two-storey porch. The west {{wing of the}} house has a stone-framed upper window and large {{attached}} tapered <b>stack.</b> <b>The</b> east wing has sashes dated to the early 19th century. The old fireplace remains in the north, facing room with it roll moulding and steeply pitched head. A chapel in the grounds {{was part of the}} house complex.|$|E

50|$|Pushing an item on to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> adjusts <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer by <b>the</b> size of {{the item}} (either decrementing or incrementing, {{depending}} on {{the direction in which}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows in memory), pointing it to the next cell, and copies the new top item to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> area. Depending again on the exact implementation, {{at the end of a}} push operation, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer may point to the next unused location in <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> or it may point to the topmost item in <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> points to <b>the</b> current topmost item, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer will be updated before a new item is pushed onto the stack; if it points to the next available location in <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> it will be updated after the new item is pushed onto <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The St. Bede Academy {{library is}} a {{multilevel}} facility {{consisting of two}} large reading rooms on two levels joined by four levels of <b>stacks.</b> <b>The</b> theology library consists of the upper reading room and the top level of <b>the</b> <b>stacks.</b> <b>The</b> academy library consists of the lower reading room and three levels of <b>stacks.</b> <b>The</b> academy collection totals 20,000 volumes and the monastery collection contains 19,000 volumes.|$|R
5|$|There {{are seven}} routes up the <b>stack,</b> <b>the</b> most {{commonly}} used {{of which is the}} original landward facing E1 (Extremely Severe). A log book in a Tupperware container is buried in a cairn on the summit, as an ascensionists' record. As many as fifty ascents of the stack are made each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{suffered a}} downturn {{between the two}} world wars, as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped, but after the Second World War peat {{was used by the}} horticultural industry in increasing volumes, and harvesting expanded again. From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction of machines that could cut and <b>stack</b> <b>the</b> peat turves. In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E
50|$|A {{minimum of}} three people are {{required}} for power block seining; the skipper, skiff operator, and corkline stacker. In many operations a fourth person <b>stacks</b> <b>the</b> leadline, and often a fifth person <b>stacks</b> <b>the</b> web.|$|R
50|$|Stack {{pointers}} may {{point to}} the origin of a stack or to a limited range of addresses either above or below the origin (depending on {{the direction in which}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows); however, <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer cannot cross the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> In other words, if the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> is at address 1000 and <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001, 1002, etc.). If a pop operation on <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> causes <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer to move past the origin of <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> a stack underflow occurs. If a push operation causes <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> a stack overflow occurs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stack</b> frame at <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> is for <b>the</b> {{currently}} executing routine. <b>The</b> <b>stack</b> frame usually includes {{at least}} the following items (in push order): ...|$|R
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could <b>stack</b> <b>the</b> government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|The third door is a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney <b>stack.).</b> <b>The</b> priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{uninhabited}} islands include Mousa, {{known for}} the Broch of Mousa, the finest preserved example in Scotland of an Iron Age broch; Noss {{to the east of}} Bressay, which has been a national nature reserve since 1955; St Ninian's Isle, connected to Mainland by the largest active tombolo in the UK; and Out <b>Stack,</b> <b>the</b> northernmost point of the British Isles. Shetland's location means that it provides a number of such records: Muness is the most northerly castle in the United Kingdom and Skaw the most northerly settlement.|$|E
50|$|When a {{subroutine}} {{is ready}} to return, it executes an epilogue that undoes {{the steps of the}} prologue. This will typically restore saved register values (such as the frame pointer value) from <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> frame, pop <b>the</b> entire <b>stack</b> frame off <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> by changing <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> pointer value, and finally branch to the instruction at the return address. Under many calling conventions the items popped off <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> by <b>the</b> epilogue include the original argument values, in which case there usually are no further stack manipulations that need to be done by the caller. With some calling conventions, however, it is the caller's responsibility to remove the arguments from <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> after <b>the</b> return.|$|R
5000|$|The IF {{construct}} {{evaluates the}} condition then tests {{the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> for <b>the</b> result. As a result RPL can optionally support FORTH-style IF blocks, allowing the condition to be determined before the block. By leaving the condition empty, the IF statement will not make any changes to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> during <b>the</b> condition execution and will use the existing result {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> for <b>the</b> test: ...|$|R
5000|$|IFT and IFTE pop two {{or three}} {{commands}} off <b>the</b> <b>stack,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> topmost value is evaluated as a boolean and, if true, the second topmost value is pushed back on <b>the</b> <b>stack.</b> IFTE allows a third [...] "else" [...] value that will be pushed back on <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> if <b>the</b> boolean is false.|$|R
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further <b>stack</b> <b>the</b> leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and <b>Stack.</b> <b>The</b> ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one <b>stack.</b> <b>The</b> rear lattice mast was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E

50|$|To form <b>the</b> <b>stacks,</b> <b>the</b> sea {{gradually}} eroded {{along the}} joints and bedding planes where the softer chalk meets harder bedrock {{of the rock}} formations to create a cave. This eventually eroded right through to create an arch. The arch subsequently collapsed to leave <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> called <b>The</b> Pinnacles.|$|R
50|$|Interrupts {{are handled}} by {{creating}} a new <b>stack</b> frame on <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> for <b>the</b> relevant process, handling the interrupt using this new environment, and then popping <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> {{to return to the}} interrupted process.|$|R
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank <b>stack.</b> <b>The</b> stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} innings, Bradman thought that rain might come so he {{utilised}} Toshack to bowl defensive leg theory. He did so {{to slow the}} scoring so that England {{would not have a}} lead by the time the rain came to create a sticky wicket, otherwise Australia would have been forced to chase a target on a difficult pitch with irregular bounce and pace. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced proceedings to continue as they posed no injury threat to the batsmen. Early on the fourth morning, Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly while bowling to Hutton and Denis Compton, but Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available, taking Toshack off. Later, Toshack was used defensively while Miller attacked from the other end. Bradman's response to a boundary being hit from Toshack was to further <b>stack</b> <b>the</b> leg side with fielders in defensive positions, and scoring was slow as Toshack bowled accurately. Toshack took the wicket of Joe Hardstaff junior for 43, who holed out to Hassett on the leg side, having supported Denis Compton in a partnership of 93. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Toshack ended with 1/60 from 33 overs as Australia were one bowler short after an injury to Lindwall had prevented him from bowling since the first afternoon. England were bowled out for 441 and Australia reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
