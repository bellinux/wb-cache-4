50|$|While the {{practice}} of keeping <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> in Ethiopia has been traced {{back as far as}} the sixteenth century, the need for systematic <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> {{that could be used for}} economic management was recognized as a priority in 1957. In 1960 compiling <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> became a regular government activity as a result of the Addis Ababa conference of the African Statisticians from UNECA member countries in 1960.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} incorporate <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> into a rule-based parser to resolve syntactic ambiguities. We extract the <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> from the Penn Treebank, and apply {{the information to the}} rule-based parser. For the extraction of the <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> the tag conversion is needed because of the disagreement of the tags and the bracketing style. We will show the effect of the tag conversion with experiments. The final result shows about 7 % error rate reduction in the dependency evaluation. We will also show how much each type of <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> affects the parsing performance...|$|R

40|$|Background. Decision aids {{often provide}} <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> and patient testimonials to guide {{treatment}} choices. This {{raises the possibility}} that the testimonials will overwhelm the <b>statistical</b> <b>information.</b> Methods. Prospective jurors in Philadelphia County were presented with hypothetical <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> about the percentage of angina patients who benefit from angioplasty and bypass surgery (50 % and 75 %, respectively). They were also given written testimonials from hypothetical patients who had benefited or not benefited from each of the two treatments. The numbers of patients benefiting and not benefiting were varied to be either proportionate to the <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> or disproportionate. In study 1, all participants received 1 testimonial from a patient who had benefited from angioplasty and 1 from a patient who had not. Participants receiving the proportionate questionnaire version were also given 3 testimonials from patients who benefited from bypass surgery and 1 from a patient who did not, coinciding with the hypothetical <b>statistical</b> <b>information.</b> In contrast, participants receiving the disproportionate questionnaire version received only 1 testimonial from a patient who benefited from surgery and 1 from a patient who did not. In study 2, all participants received 2 examples of patients who benefited from angioplasty and 2 who di...|$|R
