Because of the relatively strict Swiss banking secrecy laws, {{the stability of the}} Swiss franc and the long-standing expertise of Swiss banks in currency trading, financial tourists in the past have relied with alarming consistency on Switzerland 2 ̆ 7 s financial system to 2 ̆ 2 launder, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., introduce into the normal flow of legitimate capital, funds or assets stemming from illegal activities. Proof of Switzerland 2 ̆ 7 s status as a capital for financial tourism lies in the oft-observed coincidence that the trails of world-wide drug syndicates, dictators, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>manipulators</b> and tax evaders invariably - if only initially - lead through Switzerland. Until recently, participation in the laundering of assets known to have stemmed from a crime was not, other than under certain rare circumstances, subject to criminal sanctions in Switzerland. In the absence of applicable legislation, and in response to pressure from Swiss bank regulators to address suspected misuses of Swiss banking services, certain voluntary measures were taken by Swiss banks in 1977 {{in the form of a}} private agreement between the Swiss Bankers 2 ̆ 7 Association (SBA) and member banks of the SBA...|$|R

In the short run, a 10 percent decline in the annual real <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> return {{is associated with a}} reduction in real private consumption by around 0. 1 - 0. 3 percent on average. There is evidence that the link between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> fluctuations and private consumption has become stronger during the 1990 s as <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> in emerging economies have broadened and deepened.

The co-movements can affect the balancing strategies of country market portfolios as they indicate opportunities and risks. The strategic choice of alternative market presence, such as market entry via export marketing or a full ownership and marketing may need to match with the type of financial resources. The co-movements of and the linkages between the U. S. <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and Asian <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> have been studied extensively.

Such an understanding will provide a better grasp of the functioning of the global <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and allow investors and policy-makers to ask additional questions such as: Would an increase in bilateral trade between two countries, for example due to a new trade agreement, change the interdependence of their <b>stock</b> <b>markets?</b> If the growth rate of a particular emerging market falls due to the current global economic downturn, will its <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> drag along all the other <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> or can it be known beforehand which <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> are more likely to follow? This study empirically estimates cross-section and time-series models to determine the fundamental factors that influence the correlation and evolvement of the correlation between emerging <b>stock</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

The SUR results suggest that available bank credit and <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> turnover are inversely related to each other, confirming their substitutability in terms of external financing needed by corporations. Other significant common factors for <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> turnover and available bank credit include <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> growth, legal origin, and whether the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> is developed or emerging, an indicator of path dependence.

40|$|Abstract�Studies in {{economics}} domain tried {{to reveal the}} correlation between <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Since the globalization era, interdependence between <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> becomes more obvious. The Dynamic Interaction Network (DIN) algorithm, which {{was inspired by a}} Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) extraction method in the bioinformatics field, is applied to reveal important and complex dynamic relationship between <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> We use the data of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices from eight countries around the world in this study. Our results conclude that DIN is able to reveal and model patterns of dynamic interaction from the observed variables (i. e. <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices). Furthermore, it is also found that the extracted network models can be utilized to predict movement of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices with a considerably good accuracy.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, cointegration {{relationships}} among 26 global <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices over the periods of sub-prime and European debt crisis and their influence rank are investigated by constructing and analyzing directed and weighted cointegration networks.  The obtained results are shown as follows: the crises have changed cointegration {{relationships among}} <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices, their cointegration relationship increased after the Lehman Brothers collapse, while {{the degree of}} cointegration gradually decreased from the sub-prime to European debt crisis. The influence of US, Japan and China market indices are entirely distinguished over different periods. Before European debt crisis US <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> is a ‘global factor’ which leads the developed and emerging markets, while the influence of US <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> decreased evidently during the European debt crisis. Before sub-prime crisis, {{there is no significant}} evidence to show that other <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> co-move with China <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> while it becomes more integrated with other markets during the sub-prime and European debt crisis. Among developed and emerging <b>stock</b> <b>markets,</b> the developed <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> lead the world <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> before European debt crisis, while due to the shock of sub-prime and European debt crisis, their influences decreased and emerging <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> replaced them to lead global <b>stock</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of country and industry effects in international stock returns, with the innovation that we decompose country effects into region and within-region country effects. We divide the global <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> into the Americas, Asia, and Europe and find that most of the variation explained by country effects is actually due to region effects. Over time, these region effects have fallen. Within regions, however, only in Europe has segmentation declined, while it has increased elsewhere. Europe is also the only region where industry effects are now robustly more important than country effects.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} {{emerging}} economies, the Egyptian <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> has recently experienced a remarkable run-up {{but also a}} major downturn. This paper analyzes the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> from two angles. First, it compares {{the performance of the}} major stock price index with its underlying fundamentals. Second, it explores the relationship between the Egyptian and other <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> The paper finds that (i) there is some evidence against a stable relationship between the Egyptian index and its fundamental value; and (ii) short-term correlations and long-term cointegrating relations provide conflicting signals on the value of Egyptian stocks as a means of diversification. <b>Stock</b> markets;Stock prices;stock <b>market,</b> cointegration, correlations, <b>stock</b> price, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices, correlation, statistics, stock price index, stock exchanges, overvaluation, autocorrelation, standard deviation, <b>stock</b> index, equity <b>markets,</b> statistic, <b>stock</b> exchange, discount rate, equation, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> capitalization, present value, descriptive statistics, <b>stock</b> valuation, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index, <b>stock</b> indices, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> prices, statistical model, time series, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> development, <b>stock</b> price indices, hedge, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> developments, statistical techniques, local <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>stock</b> companies, financial statistics, financial <b>markets,</b> stationary process, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> bubble, covariance, derivative products, financial sector, derivative, stock exchange index, foreign equity, sampling, international financial statistics, real discount rate, discount rates, discounting, asset bubbles, international finance, equity market, empirical model, polynomial, parsimonious model, hypothesis testing, real variables, financial structure...|$|R
