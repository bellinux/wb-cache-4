40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{take-off}} performance of {{a model of the}} hull of a typical flying boat, Navy PH- 1, of fitting <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> of four different widths, each at three different angles, was determined by model tests in the NACA Tank. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> of widths up to 3 percent of the beam improve the general performance at speeds near the hump and reduce the spray thrown. A downward angle of 30 degrees to 45 degrees in the neighborhood of the step seems most favorable for the reduction of the <b>spray.</b> The <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> have a large effect in reducing the trimming moments at speeds near the hump speed, but have little {{effect on the}}m at high speeds...|$|R
40|$|This note {{presents}} the results of a series of tests made in the N. A. C. A. tank on a one-sixth full-size model of the hull and side floats of the Navy P 3 M- 1 flying boat for the purpose of finding a method of reducing the amount of spray thrown into the propellers of this craft when taking off and landing. The model was tested without <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and with five different spray-strip arrangements. The best arrangement was an improvement over the bare hull with no <b>spray</b> <b>strips,</b> but the improvement was not sufficient to be satisfactory with the propellers in the designed position...|$|R
40|$|Four {{models with}} {{longitudinal}} {{steps on the}} forebody were developed by modification of {{a model of a}} conventional hull and were tested in the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) tank. Models with longitudinal steps were found to have smaller resistance at high speed and greater resistance at low speed than the parent model that had the same afterbody but a conventional V-section forebody. The models with a single longitudinal step had better performance at hump speed and as low high-speed resistance except at very light loads. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> at angles from 0 degrees to 45 degrees to the horizontal were fitted at the longitudinal steps and at the chine on one of the two step models having two longitudinal steps. The resistance and the height of the spray were less with each of the <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> than without; the most favorable angle was found to lie between 15 degrees and 30 degrees...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{aerodynamic}} drag {{were made in}} the 20 -foot wind tunnel on a representative group of 11 flying-boat hull models. Four of the models were modified to investigate the effect of variations in over-all height, contours of deck, depth of step, angle of afterbody keel, and the addition of <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and windshields.

50|$|At {{the same}} time the type's predecessor, the Kawanishi H6K, was going into service in 1938 the Navy ordered the {{development}} of a larger, longer-ranged patrol aircraft under the designation Navy Experimental 13-Shi Large-size Flying Boat. The result was a large, shoulder-winged design that is widely regarded as the best flying boat of the war. Despite this, initial development was troublesome, with the prototype displaying terrible handling on the water. Deepening of the hull, redesigning of the planing bottom and the addition of <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> under the nose rectified this Two further prototypes— actually pre-production aircraft— joined the development program in December 1941.|$|R
40|$|A {{high-speed}} boat {{may encounter}} severe wave-making at {{the bow and}} become wetter at high speed. Some measures {{can be taken to}} overcome these disadvantages. In order to compare the effect of bow <b>spray</b> <b>strips</b> and Ω-type freeboards on a high-speed boat, hull wetness, resistance, hull motion, stability and the restoring moment of the heel at high speed of models with these two kinds of auxiliaries were calculated and measured. CFD methods and model tests were adopted. Both of these two auxiliaries can reduce hull wetness, and the model with a Ω-type freeboard has a better initial stability and larger restoring moment of the heel at high speed. A free running model test also indicates that the Ω-type freeboard has a fine performance...|$|R

40|$|Three {{models of}} V-bottom floats for twin-float {{seaplanes}} (N. A. C. A. models 57 -A, 57 -B, and 57 -C) having angles of dead rise of 20 degrees, 25 degrees, and thirty degrees, respectively, {{were tested in}} the N. A. C. A. tank and in the N. A. C. A. 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel. Within the range investigated, the effect of angle of dead rise on water resistance {{was found to be}} negligible at speeds up to and including the hump speed, and water resistance was found to increase with angle of dead rise at planing speeds. The height of the spray at the hump speed decreased with increase in angle of dead rise and the aerodynamic drag increased with dead rise. Lengthening the forebody of model 57 -B decreased the water resistance and the spray at speeds below the hump speed. <b>Spray</b> <b>strips</b> provided an effective means for the control of spray with the straight V sections used in the series but considerably increased the aerodynamic drag.

40|$|A {{cooperative}} research project was conducted between the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) {{to adapt the}} INEL spray forming process to produce near-net-shape lead alloy strip. The emphasis of the work was to <b>spray</b> form lead <b>strip</b> samples at INEL, {{using a variety of}} spray conditions, for characterization at JCI. An existing glove box apparatus was modified at INEL to spray form lead. The main spray forming components were housed inside the glove box. They included a spray nozzle, tundish (crucible), substrate assembly, gas heater and furnaces to heat the nozzle and tundish. To <b>spray</b> form metal <b>strip,</b> liquid metal was pressure-fed at a controlled rate through a series of circular orifices that span the width of the nozzle. There the metal contacted high velocity, high temperature inert gas (nitrogen) which atomized the molten material into fine droplets, entrained the droplets in a directed flow, and deposited them onto glass plates that were swept through the spray plume to form strip samples. In-flight convection cooling of the droplets followed by conduction and convection cooling at the substrate resulted in rapid solidification of the deposit. During operation, the inside of the glove box was purged with an inert gas to limit the effects of in-flight oxidation of the particles and spray-formed strips, as well as to protect personnel from exposure to airborne lead particulate. Remote controls were used to start/stop the spray and control the speed and position of the substrate. In addition, substrate samples were loaded into the substrate translator manually using the gloved side ports of the box. In this way, the glove box remained closed during a series of spray trials, and was opened only when loading the crucible with a lead charge or when removing lead strip samples for shipment to JCI...|$|R

40|$|In 2001, the EPA began {{restricting the}} use of {{organophosphate}} pesticides in bug <b>sprays</b> and <b>strips</b> to protect the health of humans and other mammals. Their main replacement has been another class of highly toxic pesticides known as pyrethroids. The pyrethroid molecule is basically a chemically stabilized version of the natural pyrethrin molecule found in mums (yes, the flowers). In its modified form, it is more persistent in the environment, more hydrophobic (it will stick to sediment) and more toxic. Vertebrates, including humans, have enzymes that can break down low doses of pyrethroids {{but they tend to}} have endocrine- disrupting effects. Both the pesticides and the compounds produced during their metabolism can potently mimic sex hormones. Fishes are particularly sensitive to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), due to their size and continuous exposure via contaminated water. Fish exposed to EDCs may display a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities, including poor sperm quality, skewed sex ratios and possibly population declines. The advent of new technologies has made it possible to document endocrine-disrupting effects at the parts-per-trillion range in sensitive aquatic species. Some studies have shown that low concentrations of EDCs can sometimes be more potent than higher ones. Besides the obvious implications for aquatic ecosystems, EDCs also pose significant human health concerns. According to scientists, the endocrine system is highly conserved evolutionarily among vertebrates. Pesticides, plasticizers and other EDCs that cause problems for fish will likely be harmful to people at high doses or over longer exposure periods...|$|R

40|$|Spray forming is a {{competitive}} low-cost alternative to ingot metallurgy for manufacturing ferrous and non-ferrous alloy shapes. It produces materials with a reduced number of processing steps, while maintaining materials properties, {{with the possibility}} of near-net-shape manufacturing. However, there are several hurdles to large-scale commercial adoption of spray forming: 1) ensuring strip is consistently flat, 2) eliminating porosity, particularly at the deposit/substrate interface, and 3) improving material yield. Through this program, a new strip/sheet casting process, termed spray rolling, has been developed, which is an innovative manufacturing technique to produce aluminum net-shape products. Spray rolling combines the benefits of twin-roll casting and conventional spray forming, showing a promising potential to overcome the above hurdles associated with spray forming. Spray rolling requires less energy and generates less scrap than conventional processes and, consequently, enables the development of materials with lower environmental impacts in both processing and final products. Spray Rolling was developed as a collaborative project between the University of California-Davis, the Colorado School of Mines, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and an industry team. The following objectives of this project were achieved: (1) Demonstration of the feasibility of the spray rolling process at the bench-scale level and evaluation of the materials properties of <b>spray</b> rolled aluminum <b>strip</b> alloys; and (2) Demonstration of 2 X scalability of the process and documentation of technical hurdles to further scale up and initiate technology transfer to industry for eventual commercialization of the process...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for simple {{fractional}} simultaneous determination of 6 fractions of urinary 17 -KS (androstanedione, androsterone, Δ 4 -androstenedione, etiocholanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and 11 -oxy- 17 -Ketosteroids) was established and excretion values in normal adult females and several cases with ovarian dysfunction were measured by this method and several fraction ratios were evaluated as necessary informations on their androgenisity. The new method {{consisted of the}} following procedures: 170 ml of 24 hours urine was adjusted to pH 4. 7 with acetic acid and then 6. 8 ml of 0. 2 M acetate buffer, 40, 800 Fishman units of β-glucuronidase (240 units/ml) and 5, 100 units of crystalline penicillin were added, then the urine was incubated in a water bath at 37 ℃ for 24 hours. Then 20, 400 Fishman units of β-glucuronidase were added and it was successively incubated for another 24 hours. The hydrolysed urine was extracted with ethyl acetate three times, 170, 85 and 85 ml of ethyl acetate were used. Then, alkali washing with 12. 75 ml of cold 2 N-NaOH twice and water washing with 17 ml of distilled water twice were treated to the organic phase, and alkali and water used for washing were reextracted with ethyl acetate. After drying with sodium sulfate anhydrous, the extract was evaporated to residue in vacuo at 60 ℃. The urine layer after the extraction of β-glucuronidase hydrolysate was saturated with 34 g of NaCl, and 17 ml of 50 % sulfuric acid, 3. 4 ml of 20 % formalin and 170 ml of ether were added, {{and then it was}} kept standing at room temperature for 4 days being shaken twice a day. After 4 days extraction, another 170 ml of ether was used for the reextraction. Each 170 ml of ether which extracted solvolysate was washed with 17 ml of 1 N-NaOH twice and then washed with 21 ml of distilled water twice. Alkali and water were reextracted in the same way with the extraction of β-glucuronidase hydrolysate. The layer of ether was dried with sodium sulfate anhydrous and was evaporated to residue at 45 ℃. Two step hydrolysate was chromatographed as follows; 1 : Florisil column chromatography. A glass column 28 cm long, of lcm internal diameter was packed with 4 g of florisil using chloroform. Steroid residue was absorbed on the column with 3 ml× 4 of chloroform. The development was carried out with 10 ml of chloroform and 80 ml of 0. 8 % v/v methanol-chloroform. The chloroform fraction was discarded as prewash. The fraction of 0. 8 % methanol-chloroform was evaporated to residue in vacuo at 60 ℃. The steroid residues obtained thus contained C(19) steroids, and were chromatographed on the following impregnant thin layer chromatography. 2 : Impregnant thin layer chromatography. * Preparation of thin layer 20 g of Kieselgel GF(254) was mixed vigorously with 40 ml of 30 % ethyleneglycol/methanol for 3 minutes, and the mixture was spread on a glass plate, 20 × 20 cm, 0. 45 mm thick. And the plate was allowed to stand at room temperature for few minutes and then it was warmed at 37 ℃ for 10 minutes. * Spotting and covering Immediately after warming the plate, each steroid residue obtained by column chromatography was spotted on the thin layer and the mixture of 5 authorized pure steroids (11 -deoxy- 17 -KS) was paralelly spotted by 50 % methanol-chloroform. After spotting, spotting areas were covered with 50 % ethyleneglycol-methanol to keep those areas impregnated. Otherwise, tailing and remained steroid on the spotting area were remarkable. The plate was warmed again at 37 ℃ for 10 minutes to evaporate methanol. * Development and detection of spots A chromatographic chamber was saturated with organic solvent (10 % dichlormethane, 90 % n-hexane). The spotted plate was developed in this chamber by the ascending method. When the front of the organic solvent reached 15 cm distant from the spotting line, the plate was taken out from the chamber and dried in the air and sulfuric acid was <b>sprayed</b> on the <b>strip</b> of the development of the authorized steroids and then the plate was heated at 110 ℃ for 20 minutes. Comparing with these spots of standard steroids each residue was separated into the following 6 fractions; androstanedione, androsterone, Δ 4 -androstenedione, etiocholanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and 11 -oxy- 17 -KS (from the original spotting area). * Extraction from the impregnant thin layer Each spot was scraped into the centrifuge tube with top and shaked vigorously with 10 ml of 50 % methanol-chloroform for 5 min. Then the tube was centrifuged for 10 min. at 3, 000 r. p. m. After the organic phase was transfered into the test tube, another 10 ml of 50 % methanol-chloroform was added to the centrifuge tube and shaked and centrifuged again in the same way. The eluates were collected in the test tube and evaporated at 100 ℃ in the water bath. Thus 6 fractions of urinary 17 -KS were separated easily and recovered satisfactorily. Zimmerman reaction was treated on each sample, simultaneously on 100 μg of authorized DHA. After colorimetry at 460 - 520 - 580 mμ, each fraction was estimated comparing with DHA following correction by Allen's formula. Urinary samples of 5 fractions of 11 -deoxy- 17 -KS were identified comparing with authorized pure steroids by other thin layer chromatographies, gas liquid chromatography, absorption spectra of Zimmerman reaction, Oertel-Eik-Nes reaction, absorption spectra in methanol and in the concentrated sulfuric acid. Excretion values of 6 fractions of urinary 17 -KS were determined by this method through a menstrual cycle of 3 adult normal females and through the treatment for induction of ovulation by gonadotropin on 5 patients with ovarian dysfunction. Following determination, fraction ratios were calculated as the rate of each estimated value divided by sum total of urinary 17 -KS. It was confirmed that the androsterone ratio and DHA ratio were evaluated as the indicators of androgenicity. By those experiments, the new simple method for fractional determination of urinary 17 -KS was established and would be available at every laboratory to get informations of androgenicity such as androsterone ratio and DHA ratio...|$|R
