500|$|Off of the {{strength}} of his 2008 season, the Dominican Republic national baseball team offered Ramírez the opportunity to pitch for his country in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. However, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi indicated that Ramírez was in competition for a middle-relief job, and Ramírez focused on his chances of making the Yankees' roster, declining the invitation and remaining in camp with the Yankees. In February, Ramírez suffered <b>shoulder</b> <b>bursitis,</b> which was initially considered mild. Ramírez underwent an MRI on his right shoulder during spring training. He made the Yankees' Opening Day roster, but disappointed with poor results. Ramírez pitched to a 5.19 ERA in 15 games, allowing 15 walks in [...] innings. On May 19, 2009, Ramírez was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room on the roster for pitcher Brian Bruney, who was activated off of the disabled list.|$|E

25|$|Signs {{of these}} {{conditions}} include the slow onset of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the <b>shoulder.</b> Tendinitis and <b>bursitis</b> also cause pain when the arm is lifted {{away from the body}} or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.|$|R

40|$|Water polo is {{a highly}} dynamic and {{physically}} demanding sport that has heretofore not inspired nearly as much research as other overhead sports such as baseball or swimming. As in almost all overhead sports, water polo puts its players at high risks for shoulder injuries since the motions required to perform the sport at an optimum level push the limits of normal shoulder function. Human shoulders are inherently unstable as a tradeoff to their flexibility. Because of this instability, many structures are required to work concurrently to keep the shoulder in place. These structures include muscles, ligaments and cartilages. It {{is important to recognize}} that the shoulder is not a singular joint in itself but rather a highly mobile complex that can perform many nuanced motions. Shoulder instability can cause a variety of injuries such as impingement, which occurs often among overhead athletes. This malady refers to a pathologic limitation of normal subacromial space that causes structures to be in abnormal contact with each other, which causes abrasive and pinching forces. These forces can result in a range of <b>shoulder</b> maladies including <b>bursitis,</b> tendinitis, and tearing of muscles and ligaments. Impingement is very apparent in both swimmers and water polo players due to the repetitive stresses present in each sport. In swimmers, impingement has been relatively well researched; the freestyle stroke utilized in water polo, however, is fundamentally different in that water polo players keep their heads and chests erect out of the water with a stroke known as head-up freestyle. Hitherto unknown are the biomechanics of this stroke and the extent to which impingement in water polo players is caused and/or worsened by this form of freestyle. The proposed research is a two-part study to investigate the biomechanics of water polo head-up freestyle as a first step to understanding its role in impingement in water polo players. First, experienced water polo players with healthy shoulders approved by the IRB committee of Scripps College will be recruited in this study, and their head-up freestyle kinematic sequences and muscle activities will be recorded by synchronized high-speed cinematography and fine-wire electromyography. These data will be compared to those of head-down freestyle in the literature to understand the biomechanical differences between head-up in and head-down. Part II of the study will recruit experienced water polo players with existing shoulder impingement in addition to those with healthy shoulders in Part I, and their head-up freestyle will be recorded in the same manner. These data will be compared to those in Part I to understand how the head-up stroke differs between impinged and healthy shoulders. This research will provide a basis for the understanding of impingement in head-up freestyle to ultimately increase the safety of the players. Further studies should be conducted to compare the patterns of biomechanical differences between healthy and impinged shoulders in head-up vs. head-down, analyze impingement in each phase of the head-up swim stroke, and investigate how the rate of impingement is altered by fatigue and poor technique...|$|R

50|$|There can {{be several}} {{concurrent}} causes. Trauma, auto-immune disorders, infection and iatrogenic (medicine-related) factors can all cause bursitis. Bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive movement and excessive pressure. Shoulders, elbows and knees {{are the most}} commonly affected. Inflammation of the bursae may also be caused by other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus and gout. Immune deficiencies, including HIV and diabetes, can also cause bursitis. Infrequently, scoliosis can cause bursitis of the shoulders; however, <b>shoulder</b> <b>bursitis</b> is more commonly caused by overuse of the shoulder joint and related muscles.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2005, Baseball America listed him as the No. 1 pitching prospect in baseball and No. 2 overall behind Joe Mauer. Hernández continued his success in 2005 with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers in the Pacific Coast League, posting a 9-4 record with a league-leading 2.25 ERA and 100 strikeouts in just 88 innings.

40|$|Bursa is fluid-filled sac {{filled with}} a small amount of liquid called synovial. Bursa is located in many places in the body mostly between bones and the tendons and muscles near joints. The bursa reduces {{friction}} and eases the movement between the bones, tendons and other tissues. The biggest bursas are located between tendons and bone, usually over the large joints such as shoulder, elbow, hips and knees. Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa and itcan be caused by various factors such as: trauma (repetitive movements), infection, deposition of microcrystals. Acupuncture as part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is very often used in the treatment of bursitis. In the research are included 30 patients, 18 male and 12 female, on age from 18 to 71, treated with acupuncture for <b>shoulder</b> <b>bursitis.</b> Acupuncture treatments were made in a clinic for TCM and acupuncture, on room temperature, with normal and fire needles, on certain trigger points - Ashi.

40|$|Nephrogenic {{systemic}} fibrosis (NSF) is an idiopathic, progressive, systemic fibrosis {{that occurs}} in patients with renal diseases. Recently, gadolinium-containing contrast (Gd-contrast) has become a suspected causal factor for NFS. This report discusses two female patients with end-stage renal disease, aged 70 and 51 years, respectively, who developed histologically proven NSF after exposure to Gd-contrast. Clinically, both patients were characterized by fibrosis and induration of skin and muscle mainly in the limbs with joint contracture. In the first case, NSF developed gradually after undergoing evaluation by Gd-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent surgery for her urothelial carcinoma. In the second patient, NSF developed after undergoing evaluation by Gd-contrast MRI for her right <b>shoulder</b> <b>bursitis</b> with calcification, and the conditions of NSF continued to worsen after the surgical treatment of this right shoulder lesion. Although the role of Gd-contrast in NSF is still not well known, the correlation in our cases strongly suggests {{that it should be}} used with cautioned in patients with end-stage renal disease. Both of our patients underwent surgery before or during the development of NSF, indicating that the surgical procedure may be a contributing factor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>bursitis</b> and {{supraspinatus}} tendinitis {{are common}} conditions {{that result from}} the inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon. These cause pressure to be placed more heavily on the anterior bursa sac, along with the surrounding bones and nerves. A common treatment is conductive cooling on the affected region, generally {{in the form of}} a cold pack. However, if the cold pack is left on for too short of a time period, the cooling may not reach the tendon. The tendinitis would not be adequately treated in this case, as the inflammation could not be reduced if the tendon is not cooled to a temperature close to that of the rest of the body. If it is left on for too long, the patient may be subject to significant pain and the surrounding healthy tissue may be permanently damaged. Therefore, our goal is to identify the ideal treatment time for treating supraspinatus tendon inflammation. We created a three-dimensional model of the shoulder using COMSOL, with components integrated from Autodesk™ Computer aided design software and Google Sketch-Up. The implementation of our model into COMSOL allowed us to simulate the effects of this type of cold therapy on a human shoulder. A number of major parameter simplifications were required for adequate implementation into our model. Such simplifications included the grouping of the skin and muscle components, approximation of the humerus to a cylinder and a sphere, and grouping of the bursa sac and supraspinatus tendon into one domain because the two structures were too close together to be included in the model individually. We researched relevant literature to obtain property values for the bone and tissue components of our model. We used our best judgment to approximate the property values for parts of the geometry that were simplified, such as the tendon, muscle, and skin. In order to counteract any inaccuracy that could have resulted from imprecise averaged values, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine how tendon temperature varied with changes in the various material properties. This analysis supported our approximations. To further validate our model, we compared our results with previous research. The results of their study provided us with a guideline as to how much the muscle region should cool in a certain time period. Within that time period, our muscle tissue cooled by the expected amount, which validated our model. We decided that a 3 -dimensional analysis of the supraspinatus tendon was necessary because the shoulder is asymmetric, so a 2 -dimensional model would not be capable of capturing the necessary complexity. We determined that the standard suggested practice of treating an injury for a maximum of 20 minutes was not applicable for injuries that are as deep as the supraspinatus tendon. In this amount of time, the tendon’s temperature decreased by 3. 05 Kelvin, when it needed to decrease by 7 K to be measured as successful cooling. We identified the ideal cold treatment time to be 96 minutes, using COMSOL to determine the point at which the supraspinatus tendon cooled within 1 K of body temperature. Further analysis indicated that the suprascapular nerve would not reach the threshold for cold pain of 288 K. However, other areas closer to the surface would reach temperatures well below this threshold. The cooling of the nerves running through this region could lead to significant pain. Literature shows that cooling for more than an hour could lead to permanent tissue damage, so 96 minutes of continuous cold treatment is not recommended. While our assumptions limit the clinical significance of this study, our results indicated that the use of cold therapy for only 20 minutes is ineffective because it does not reduce the temperature of the tendon enough to reduce inflammation. Cold treatment would likely be improved by the addition of anti-inflammatory drugs, in an attempt to combat the inflammation in two ways. We would recommend that further studies utilize unique heat transfer properties for the structures present in the shoulder instead of grouping them as one. This would bring the study closer to a clinically significant stage. In addition, further analysis of the likelihood of the pain response could be included by the addition of nerves to the model. Our model could also be used to test other cold or heat therapy technologies and their probable pervasiveness in the human shoulder, specifically the glenoid and sub-acromial regions...|$|E
