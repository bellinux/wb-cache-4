5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf. The {{judgment}} was given by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993, and reinstated the decision of Kennedy J in the High Court of Justice; unlike the Court of Appeal decision, it directly {{addressed the issue of}} Rylands v Fletcher. Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, nor that there was <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> attached to that right.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.|$|E

25|$|<b>Strict</b> <b>liability.</b> States that impose <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> {{make the}} owner of a dog liable for {{injuries}} caused by a dog, without further consideration of the facts. <b>Strict</b> <b>liability</b> laws may require that the person seeking damages for a dog bite prove that they were acting peacefully and lawfully {{at the time of the}} bite.

25|$|A {{statutory}} tort is {{like any}} other, {{in that it}} imposes duties on private or public parties, however they are created by the legislature, not the courts.

25|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was further}} developed by English courts, {{and made an}} immediate impact on the law. Prior to Rylands, English courts had not based their decisions in similar cases on <b>strict</b> <b>liability,</b> and had focused on the intention behind the actions rather than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves. In contrast, Rylands imposed <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> on those found detrimental in such a fashion without having to prove a duty of care or negligence, which brought the law into line with that relating to public reservoirs and marked a significant doctrinal shift. Academics have criticised it, however, both for the economic damage such a doctrine could cause and for its limited applicability.|$|E

40|$|The United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan {{developed}} their product liability laws {{based on a}} common desire to protect consumers.

By examining the development of <b>strict</b> product <b>liability</b> in each of these countries, focusing on statutory and common law language, as well as the position of, structure of, and access to the judiciary, this Note concludes, due to the similarities between the United Kingdom and Japan-similarities generally not existing with respect to the United States-that Japan is more likely to develop its product liability regime in accordance with the United Kingdom, rather than the United States...|$|R
25|$|The rule of <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> famously {{laid down}} by Blackburn J., in Rylands v.

The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> viz., the non-natural use of land, use of a dangerous thing, and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises to escape liability under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule. Moreover, the exceptions provided within the rule (and restated by the Supreme Court of India in MC Mehta v. Union of India) afford ample opportunity to the commercial enterprises to escape liability.|$|E

25|$|In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> for {{the escape}} of fire; additionally, <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> was imposed {{for the release}} of cattle. Negligently {{handling}} fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this criticism, in the 1890s, state courts around the country adopted Rylands v.

25|$|In DPP v Harper (1997) it {{was held}} that {{insanity}} is not generally a defense to <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol.

40|$|The Restatement (Third) of Torts is {{expected}} to continue the consumer-oriented trend that began with the recognition of <b>strict</b> products <b>liability</b> under section 402 A. Earlier law had required an injured plaintiff either to focus on the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s failure to conform to the standard of care as required by the law of negligence or to comply with the Uniform Commercial Code’s complicated law of warranty. Later, the law of <b>strict</b> products <b>liability</b> allowed an injured consumer to prevail simply by establishing that the product in question was defective. Once enacted, section 402 A resulted in a greatly increased number of lawsuits in the area of consumer protection. Manufacturers are now even held responsible not only for defective products causing injury, as contemplated by the Restatement, but also goods that would not ordinarily be perceived as “products. ” Some maintain that products liability should now extend to injuries inflicted during the dismantling, destruction, and general recycling of products. In thirty years, the legal system has perhaps gone from <b>strict</b> products <b>liability</b> to unlimited liability, creating an “insurance crisis” outcry and appeals for tort reform. The {{purpose of this article is}} to consider an idea that has previously received little attention: the premise that a manufacturer should not be held responsible for injuries once the useful life of its product has come to an end. We should explore the prospect that, like all things tangible, products eventually grow old and die, and that once this process has taken place, a manufacturer should not be held responsible for resulting injuries...|$|R
