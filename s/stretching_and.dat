5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> releasing zinc oxide nanowires. This mini-generator creates an oscillating voltage up to 45 millivolts, converting close to {{seven percent of}} the applied mechanical energy into electricity. Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the {{drainage}} area of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a graben region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.|$|E

25|$|Pain in contractions {{has been}} {{described}} as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps. Women are often encouraged to refrain from screaming, but moaning and grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain. Crowning may be experienced as an intense <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> burning. Even women who show little reaction to labour pains, in comparison to other women, show a substantially severe reaction to crowning.|$|E
25|$|This bond has {{alternating}} <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> heading courses, {{with the}} headers centred over {{the midpoint of}} the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.|$|E

25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} {{plaiting}} the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are plaited as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The remainder of the sling is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists <b>stretching,</b> <b>and</b> therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, a {{topological space}} is a {{geometric}} object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> bending {{of the object}} into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists can't {{tell the difference between}} a coffee cup and a donut, since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.|$|E
25|$|Slab {{rollback}} is {{not always}} a continuous process suggesting an episodic nature. The episodic nature of the rollback is explained by a change in the density of the subducting plate, such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere (a continent, arc, ridge, or plateau), a change in the subduction dynamics, or a change in the plate kinematics. The age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab rollback. Nearby continental collisions have an effect on slab rollback. Continental collisions induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material, which causes <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> arc-trench rollback. In the area of the Southeast Pacific, there have been several rollback events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc basins.|$|E

25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the {{air cycle machine}} used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> relaxing. Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medicines}} such as aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen {{among others}} {{can be taken to}} help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after 6 to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{recommended}} light {{exercises and}} stretching {{but not in}} the four hours before bed to help with sleep. <b>Stretching</b> <b>and</b> movement therapies are also recommended for pain. Previously, a 2014 National Institutes of Health report concluded that while GET could produce benefits, it may not yield improvement in quality of life and that because of this limitation, GET should not be considered as a primary treatment, but instead be used only as one component of a broader approach. The report also noted that a focus on exercise programs had discouraged patient participation in other types of physical activity, due to concerns of precipitating increased symptoms. A July 2016 addendum to this report recommended that the Oxford criteria not be used when studying ME/CFS. If studies based on the Oxford criteria were excluded, there would be insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of GET on any outcome.|$|E

25|$|The dismemberment and {{subsidence}} of continental crust into horsts, rotated fault {{blocks and}} half-grabens {{that underlie the}} Spratly Islands and surrounding sea bottom occurred in 2 distinct periods. They occurred {{as the result of}} the tectonic stretching of continental crust along underlying deeply rooted detachment faults. During the Late Cretaceous and Early Oligocene, the earliest period of tectonic stretching of continental crust and formation of horsts, half-grabens, and rotated fault-blocks occurred in association the rifting and later sea-floor spreading that created the South China Sea. During the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene additional <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> block faulting of continental crust occurred within the Spratly Islands and adjacent Dangerous Ground. During and after this period of tectonic activity, corals and other marine life colonised the crests of the horsts and other ridges that lay in shallow water. The remains of these organisms accumulated over time as biogenic carbonates that comprise the current day reefs, shoals and cays of the Spratly Islands. Starting with their formation in Late Cretaceous, fine-grained organic-rich marine sediments accumulated within the numerous submarine half-grabens that underlie sea bottom within the Dangerous Ground region.|$|E
25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. Molecules {{containing}} argon can be van der Waals molecules held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> bending movements, microwave spectroscopy and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. Mass spectroscopy is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of in silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment. This article is mostly based on experimental or observational results.|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E
