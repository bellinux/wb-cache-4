40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} novel stabilized finite element methods in the convective-diffusive context that exhibit correct-energy behavior. Classical stabilized formulations can create unwanted artificial energy. Our contribution corrects this undesired property by employing the concepts of dynamic as well as orthogonal <b>small-scales</b> within the variational multiscale framework (VMS). The desire for correct energy indicates that the large- and <b>small-scales</b> should be H_ 0 ^ 1 -orthogonal. Using this orthogonality the VMS method can be converted into the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) or the Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) method. Incorporating both large- and <b>small-scales</b> in the energy definition asks for dynamic behavior of the <b>small-scales.</b> Therefore, the large- and <b>small-scales</b> are treated as separate equations. Two consistent variational formulations which depict correct-energy behavior are proposed: (i) the Galerkin/least-squares method with dynamic <b>small-scales</b> (GLSD) and (ii) the dynamic orthogonal formulation (DO). The methods are presented in combination with an energy-decaying generalized-α time-integrator. Numerical verification shows that dissipation due to the <b>small-scales</b> in classical stabilized methods can become negative, both on a local and global scale. The results show that without loss of accuracy the correct-energy behavior can be recovered by the proposed methods. The computations employ NURBS-based isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation is to compare the <b>small-scaled</b> model test by the flume with the full-scaled model test {{carried out by the}} towing tank and to find out the differences between the test results and the test facilities to give proper suggestions for the design and operation on <b>small-scaled</b> testing facilities. The methodology used in this dissertation is carried out on the <b>small-scaled</b> model test in the flume. Three main steps are carried out, the first is comparing the test results of the flume and the towing tank for both the stationary test and the free vibration test, the second is looking for the theoretical explanations {{of the differences between the}} test results, the third is finding out the advantages and disadvantages of the <b>small-scaled</b> model testing facility compared with the full-scaled model test results which have been carried out by the towing tank in the previous research. After the model test, the wake oscillator model is also used simulate the real model test and find out the influence of different parameters on the test results. The main conclusions of this dissertation is that for <b>small-scaled</b> model test carried out in the flume, the free vibration tests match the full-scaled model well, which can be used to evaluate the vibration suppression efficiency of the strake model. In the stationary test, the <b>small-scaled</b> model provides higher drag coefficient due to the difference of Reynolds number. In the numerical model, the parameters which may influence the oscillating amplitudes are the tuning parameters and the different series of tuning parameters are given according to the spring stiffness. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} a correct-energy stabilized finite element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The framework of the methodology and the correct-energy concept have been developed in the convective-diffusive context in the preceding paper [M. F. P. ten Eikelder, I. Akkerman, Correct energy evolution of stabilized formulations: The relation between VMS, SUPG and GLS via dynamic orthogonal <b>small-scales</b> and isogeometric analysis. The convective-diffusive context, CMAME, Accepted 2018]. This work extends ideas of this paper to build a stabilized method within the variational multiscale (VMS) setting which displays correct-energy behavior. Similar to the convection-diffusion case, a key ingredient is the proper dynamic and orthogonal behavior of the <b>small-scales.</b> This is demanded for correct energy behavior and links the VMS framework to the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) and the Galerkin/least-squares method (GLS). The presented method is a Galerkin/least-squares formulation with dynamic divergence-free <b>small-scales</b> (GLSDD). It is locally mass-conservative for both the large- and <b>small-scales</b> separately. In addition, it locally conserves linear and angular momentum. The computations require and employ NURBS-based isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization. The resulting formulation numerically shows improved energy behavior for turbulent flows comparing with the original VMS method...|$|R
