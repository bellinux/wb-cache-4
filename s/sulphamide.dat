5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that IG Farben might have made its {{breakthrough}} discovery with sulfanilamide in 1932 but, recognizing {{that it would not be}} patentable as an antibacterial, had spent the next three years developing Prontosil as a new, and therefore more easily patentable, compound. However Dr. Bovet, who has received a Nobel Prize for medicine, and one of the authors of the French discovery, wrote in 1988: [...] "Today, we have the proof that the chemists of Elberfeld were unaware of the properties of sulfanilamide at the time of our discovery and that it was by our communication that they were informed. To be convinced about it, it is enough to attentively examine the monthly reports of work of Mietzsch and Klarer during years 1935-1936 and especially the Log Book of Gerhard Domagk: the formula of <b>sulphamide</b> is consigned there - without comment - not before January 1936." ...|$|E
40|$|Dichlofluanid (N-dichlorofluoromethylthio-N′-dimethyl-N- phenylsulphamide) {{is used as}} booster biocide in {{antifouling}} paints. The {{occurrence of}} dichlofluanid and its metabolite DMSA (N′-dimethyl-N-phenyl- <b>sulphamide)</b> was monitored in seawater and marine sediment from three Greek marinas. Seawater and sediment samples were collected at three representative positions and one suspected hotspot in each marina and shipped to the laboratory for chemical analysis. As part of the project, an analytical method had been developed and validated. Furthermore, some additional experiments were carried out to investigate the potential contribution of paint particle bound dichlofluanid on the total concentration in the sediment. As expected, given its known high hydrolytic degradation rate, no detectable concentrations of dichlofluanid were measured {{in any of the}} seawater samples. DMSA was detected in seawater samples at very low concentrations varying from < 3 ng l - 1 (LOD) to 36 ng l- 1. During method validation, it had already been demonstrated that dichlofluanid is unstable in sediment and can therefore only be determined as its metabolite DMSA. In a separate experiment, in which marine sediment was spiked with artificial paint particles containing dichlofluanid and then analysed according to the validated method, it was demonstrated that if there is any dichlofluanid originating from paint particles, this would be determined as DMSA. No DMSA was detected in any of the sediment samples. It could therefore be concluded that there were no significant concentrations of dichlofluanid in the sediment samples. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{level of}} heavy metals in aquatic system due to incomplete treatment of industrial wastewater by existing conventional methods is of environmental concern. Therefore, {{there has been}} an increasing interest on the possibility of using biological treatments such as biosorption in the abatement of heavy metal–contaminated wastewater. In this study, a two-stage process for Cu(II) and Ni(II) removal has been developed. The first stage involves biosorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions by rubber wood shavings (RWS) followed by a polishing stage where the remaining metal ions exist in the wastewater will be adsorbed by dead bacterial biomass immobilized in alginate matrix (Strontium Alginate Immobilized Bacteria, SAIB) prior to discharge. Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clavibacter agropyri and Cellulosimicrobium cellulans were tested for growth in cheap carbon sources i. e. liquid pineapple waste (LPW) and brown sugar and tolerance towards Cu(II) and Ni(II). SAIB and NaOH–treated RWS were subjected to Cu(II) and Ni(II) removal studies where parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dosage and initial metal concentrations were optimized. Both LPW and brown sugar can serve as an alternative and cost-effective growth medium for largescale cultivation of bacteria. Supplementation of brown sugar with tryptone gave the highest biomass yield. Bacterial growth in LPW were greatly affected after addition of metal especially Cu(II) indicating the toxic effect. A. haemolyticus was chosen for biosorption study as it is the most tolerant strain where it can resist up to 25 mg L- 1 of Cu(II) and 500 mg L- 1 of Ni(II). From the biosorption study using RWS and SAIB, contact time of 5 hours and initial metal concentration of 100 mg L- 1 were optimized. Nevertheless, the adsorbent dosage for RWS and dried SAIB bead varies with values of 3 % (w/v) and 0. 025 g respectively. The Cu(II) and Ni(II) adsorption using RWS and SAIB in single and mixed metal solution occurs as monolayer coverage as confirmed by Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal analysis. However, the Ni(II) adsorption by RWS in mixed metal solution cannot be modeled by both isotherms. FTIR and FESEM–EDAX analysis suggest the removal of Cu(II) and Ni(II) by A. haemolyticus was due to electrostatic interaction or complexation of the metal ions with the functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, amide and <b>sulphamide</b> present on the cell wall. The integration of biosorption processes using RWS and SAIB resulted in 77. 8 % Cu(II) and 64. 1 % Ni(II) removal from the electronic wastewater...|$|E

However, the women recorded results of BMI significantly (P 0. 05) {{during the month of}} Ramadan. In addition, during the two periods experimental, the women showed relatively high rates in LDL- and cholesterol compared to the men (P< 0. 01). As for proteinous compounds...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{reviews the}} {{literature}} concerning transition metal n 3 -oxodimethylenemethane-(metallacyclobutan- 3 -one), metallathietane- 3 -oxide, metallathietane- 3, 3 -dioxide and ureylene complexes. The review also briefly discusses {{the use of}} the oxodimethylenemethane metal fragment in organic synthesis. The preparation and characterisation of platinathiazetidine- 3 -imine complexes [Pt{lcub}NPhC(=NPh) S{rcub}L 2] are described in Chapter 2. X-ray crystallographic studies on two of these derivatives (L = PPh 3 or PMePh 2) revealed the near-planarity of the four-membered ring. Both triphenylphosphine ligands in [Pt{lcub}NPhC(=NPh) S{rcub} (PPh 3) 2] are easily displaced by more basic phosphines or a chelating phosphine, and one is displaced by t-butyl isocyanide to give a monosubstituted derivative. The complex reacts with carbon monoxide to give a ring expansion product. Attempted ring expansions with small cumulenes were unsuccessful. Treatment of [Rh(C 1) (CO) (dppm) ] 2 with the dianion of N,N'-diphenylthiourea led to formation of the "A"-frame complex [Rh 2 (micro-S) (CO) 2 (dppm) 2]. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis and characterisation of platinathiadiazetidine- 3, 3 -dioxide complexes of the type [Pt{lcub}NRS(O) 2 NR{rcub}L 2] (R = H or Ph). X-ray crystallographic studies on two of the derivatives (R = H, L = PMePh 2; R = Ph, L 2 = COD) showed the four-membered rings to be entirely flat, the molecules possessing a two-fold rotation axis about the platinum-sulphur vector. Efforts to insert small cumulene molecules into the N-H bonds of [Pt{lcub}NHS(O) 2 NH{rcub}(PMePh 2) 2] are described. Treatment of this complex with phenylacetylene gave trans-[Pt(C=CPh) 2 (PMePh 2) 2], whereas with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate the complex [Pt{lcub}C(CO 2 Me) =C(CO 2 Me) NHS(O) 2 NH{rcub} (PMePh 2) 2] was obtained, formally derived from insertion of the acetylene into a platinum-nitrogen bond. An X-ray crystallographic study revealed that the six-membered ring in this complex adopted a "pseudo-boat" conformation. Reaction of [PtC 12 (COD) ] with <b>sulphamide</b> and excess silver(I) oxide in refluxing dichloromethane, followed by treatment of the filtrate from this reaction with an excess of t-butyl isocyanide afforded a complex which was formulated as [Pt{lcub}C(=NBut) NHS(O) 2 NHC(=NBut) {rcub}(CNBut) 2]. One phosphine ligand in [Pt{lcub}NPhS(O) 2 NPh) (PPh 3) 2] can be replaced by t-butyl isocyanide to give a monosubstituted complex. The final Chapter briefly describes attempts to synthesise further Pt(II) complexes from cis-[PtC 12 L 2] and ligands possessing "activated" protons. The interaction of cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 3) 2] with some p-tosylhydrazones in the presence of silver(I) oxide is investigated, and liquid ammonia as a synthetic reagent was also used in some of these reactions instead of silver(I) oxide. The complexes cis-[Pt{lcub}NHS(O) 2 C 6 H 4 -P-R{rcub} 2 L 2] (R = H or Me) are obtained on reaction of cis-[PtC 12 L 2] with the appropriate sulphon-amide and an excess of silver(I) oxide in dichloromethane. The reaction of cis-[PtC 12 (PPh 3) 2] with urea and silver(I) oxide in dichloromethane, or with urea in liquid ammonia, was investigated...|$|E
