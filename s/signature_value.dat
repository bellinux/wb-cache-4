Software implementation has been done using MATLAB and SIMULINK, whereas, for the hardware implementation of the system, we have chosen the NI ELVIS platform.

40|$|Abstract — Most {{e-government}} applications {{have to find}} {{a solution}} for simple, reliable, secure and authentic signing of official documents. Citizens need a simple way to verify the authenticity and integrity of an official document. Currently XML documents allow representing such documents. However, the XML format does not guarantee a definite visual presentation of the document (presentation problem). In this paper we describe a solution approach- so-called Authentic PDF- using PDF technology that fulfills the following key requirements: 1) A visual presentation that resembles the traditional style of an official document; 2) A visual representation of the <b>signature</b> <b>value</b> that does not change the document authenticity; 3) The option for the holder of an official document to restore the electronic version of the authentic official document from the visual representation of the document (e. g. printout); 4) The filtering of dynamic content. We implemented and evaluated different approaches in a feasibility study using a typical e-government document set. Results of the study are: PDF is suitable to meet specific legal requirements on a signature solution in combination with a smartcard; the method has proven to be reliable and support a sufficient level of security.

40|$|Phase-change {{random access}} memory (PRAM) is a {{promising}} storage-class memory technology {{that has the potential}} to replace flash memory and DRAM in many applications. Because individual cells in a PRAM can be written independently, only data cells whose current values differ from the corresponding bits in a write request need to be updated. Furthermore, when a block write request is received, the PRAM may contain many free blocks that are available for overwriting, and these free blocks will generally have different contents. For this reason, the number of bit programming operations required to write new data to the PRAM (and consequently power consumption and write bandwidth) depends on the location that is chosen to be overwritten. This paper describes a block placement algorithm for reducing PRAM bit writes based on the idea of indexing free blocks using a content-based signature; computing the <b>signature</b> <b>value</b> of a new block of data to be written allows a free block with similar contents to be located quickly. While the benefit that can be realized by the use of any block placement algorithm is heavily dependent on the workload, our evaluation results show that block placement using content-based signatures is able {{to reduce the number of}} PRAM bit programming operations by as much as an order of magnitude. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{analyzing}} 16 S rRNA catalog data {{has been developed}} in which groupings at various taxonomic levels can be characterized in terms of specific "signature" oligonucleotides. This approach provides an alternative means for evaluating higher order branching possibilities {{and can be used}} to assess the phylogenetic position of isolates that are poorly placed by the usual clustering procedures. This signature approach has been applied to forty archaebacterial catalogs and every oligonucleotide with significant <b>signature</b> <b>value</b> has been identified. Sets of specific oligonucleotides were identified for every major group on a dendrogram produced by cluster analysis procedures. Signatures that would establish between group relationships were also sought and found. In the case of the Methanobacteriaceae the clustering methods suggest a specific relationship to the Methanococcaceae. This inclusion is in fact supported by six strong signature oligonucleotides. However there are also significant numbers of signature oligonucleotides supporting a specific relationship of the Methanobacteriaceae to either the Halobacteriaceae or the Methanomicrobiaceae. Thus the placement of the Methanobacteriaceae is less certain than the usual dendrograms imply. The signature approach also was used to assess the phylogenetic position of Thermoplasma acidophilum which is found to be more closely related to the methanogen/halophile Division than to the sulfur dependent Division of the archaebacteria. This does not imply however that Thermoplasma acidophilum is properly regarded as being in the methanogen/halophile Division...|$|E

An enterprise data leak is a scary statement. Security practitioners have always had to deal with data leakage issues that spring up from various ways like email, IM and other Internet channels. One or more agents can leak the data. Moreover, data can also be leaked from within an organization via e-mails. So, there is need to filter these e-mails. The mail can be filtered by blocking e-mails which contains images, videos or sensitive data of an enterprise. The e-mail is one of the sources of data leakage. Principle used in e-mail security is we classify e-mail, sensitive data into the white and black lists with document’s digital <b>signature</b> <b>value.</b> The data can also be changed by the trusted agents. The system will detect such a changes of the sensitive data and if founds same as black list it will block the mail or stop for review. Then the distributor will decide to allow or disallow the incoming mails from the agent’s. The system will prevent the enterprise data from data leakage. E-mail security system will make the data more secure. Index Terms – Black List, SHA, TF, White List...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} pairwise Boolean {{matching algorithm}} {{to solve the}} problem of matching single-output specified Boolean functions under input negation and/or input permutation and/or output negation (NPN) is proposed in this paper. We present the Structural Signature (SS) vector, which is composed of a 1 st <b>signature</b> <b>value,</b> two symmetry marks, and a group mark. As a necessary condition for NPN Boolean matching, the structural signature is more effective than is the traditional signature. Two Boolean functions, f and g, may be equivalent when they have the same SS vector. The symmetry mark can distinguish symmetric variables and asymmetric variables and search multiple variable mappings in a single variable-mapping search operation, which reduces the search space significantly. Updating the SS vector using Shannon decomposition provides benefits in distinguishing unidentified variables, and the group mark and the phase collision check discover incorrect variable mappings quickly, which also speeds up the NPN Boolean matching process. Using the algorithm proposed in this paper, we tested both equivalent and non-equivalent matching peeds on the MCNC benchmark circuit sets and the random circuit sets. In the experiment, our algorithm is two times faster than competitors when testing equivalent circuits and averages at least one hundred times faster when testing non-equivalent circuits. The experimental results show that our approach is highly effective in solving the NPN Boolean matching problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new cryptographic problem called time capsule signature. Time capsule signature is a `future signature ' that becomes valid from a specific future time t, when a trusted third party (called Time Server) publishes some trapdoor information associated with the time t. In addition, time capsule signature should satisfy the following properties: (1) If the signer wants, she can make her time capsule signature effective before the pre-defined time t. (2) The recipient of `future signature ' can verify right away that the signature will become valid no later than at time t. (3) Time Server need not contact any user at any time, and in fact {{does not need to}} know anything about the PKI employed by the users. (4) Signatures completed by the signer before time t are indistinguishable from the ones completed using the Time Server at time t. We provide the rigorous definition of time capsule signature and the generic construction based on another new primitive of independent interest, which we call identity-based trapdoor hard-to-invert relation (IDTHIR). We also show an efficient construction of ID-THIRs (and, hence, time capsule signatures) in the random oracle model, and a less efficient construction in the standard model. If the time t is replaced by a specific event, the concept of time capsule signature can be generalized to event capsule signature. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Time Capsule Signature In an ordinary signature scheme, the validity of a <b>signature</b> <b>value</b> is determinedat the point of signature generation and never changes (unless the signer's public key is revoked).

40|$|Information about rainfall–runoff {{processes}} {{is essential}} for hydrological analyses, modelling and water-management applications. A hydrological, or diagnostic, signature quantifies such information from observed data as an index <b>value.</b> <b>Signatures</b> are widely used, e. g. for catchment classification, model calibration and change detection. Uncertainties in the observed data – including measurement inaccuracy and representativeness as well as errors relating to data management – propagate to the <b>signature</b> <b>values</b> and reduce their information content. Subjective choices in the calculation method are a further source of uncertainty. We review the uncertainties relevant to different signatures based on rainfall and flow data. We propose a generally applicable method to calculate these uncertainties based on Monte Carlo sampling and demonstrate it in two catchments for common signatures including rainfall–runoff thresholds, recession analysis and basic descriptive signatures of flow distribution and dynamics. Our intention is to contribute to awareness and knowledge of signature uncertainty, including typical sources, magnitude and methods for its assessment. We found that the uncertainties were often large (i. e. typical intervals of ± 10 – 40 % relative uncertainty) and highly variable between signatures. There was greater uncertainty in signatures that use high-frequency responses, small data subsets, or subsets prone to measurement errors. There was lower uncertainty in signatures that use spatial or temporal averages. Some signatures were sensitive to particular uncertainty types such as rating-curve form. We found that signatures can be designed to be robust to some uncertainty sources.
