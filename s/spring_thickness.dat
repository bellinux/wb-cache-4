The result is a considerable reduction in the lever arm length and a corresponding increase in the spring load. This is in turn compensated for by a reduction in the <b>spring</b> <b>thickness.</b>|$|E

Results indicated that the broken width values around the gateways were larger than 1. 5 m, {{and those in the}} roof and high side wall were larger than those in the low side wall, as a whole. The width values had close relationships with the thickness of the coal seam and immediate roof, angle of the coal seam, and depth of the gateways. Furthermore, combined with the plastic zone of numerical models in 3 -Dimensional Distinct Element Code (3 DEC) and the broken width, we obtained the excavation broken zone (EBZ) cross-section diagram for each gateway and determined that the EBZ appeared to have a basically elliptical shape—with the long axis along the seam inclination direction and the short axis along the vertical direction of the rock layer—and that this elliptical shape was only slightly affected by the gateway cross-section shape. It was observed that the failure extent was greater in the seam inclination direction than in the vertical direction of the rock layer. Obviously, the gateways presented asymmetric failure characteristics and implied that an asymmetric support system should be provided when using bolts, cables, and shotcrete combined with steel mesh and steel belts. Such a support system could improve material parameters and form a combined arch structure in surrounding rocks, with arch crown and arch <b>springing</b> <b>thicknesses</b> that are larger in the roof and high side wall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- While {{considering}} the optimization in {{the geometry of}} the leaf spring, {{it can be said}} that the design of leaf <b>spring</b> is quiet <b>thickness</b> sensitive due to its relative dimensions & the loading direction. Hence stress analysis of a mono leaf spring is done by F. E. M. before and after changing the variation of its thickness along the length. The variation of thickness considered initially is linear. After careful study it was judged that if the thickness is varied parabolically along the length of the leaf spring, better results can be obtained. Hence the values of stress at different points along the length (average values at various cross sections) for both geometries are compared graphically. In short the stress variation along the length for both geometries is plotted on graph and comparison is visualized by overlapping of graphs. An Improvement in the distribution of stress along the length improves the utilization of material & thus mass of the leaf spring can be reduced. Parabolic variation of thickness along the length also permits decrease in width to thickness ratio, resulting in reduction of material required, without reduction in deflection obtained (in fact deflection increases). This is also revealed from the Finite element analysis and the comparison of deflection obtained in case of both the geometries at maximum as well as minimum load...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTerfenol-D {{composites}} attract {{much attention}} recently {{due to their}} large magnetostriction, small eddy energy loss and large operation frequency bandwidth. Binder layer in the composite usually mechanically weakens the composite and reduces the effective properties. A typical kind of magnetostictive composite is composed of Rare Earth metallic compound powder, matrix material and resin binder. The binder, which is usually flexible and forms mechanically weak interface in the composite, inevitably influences the overall magnetostriction of composites. In this paper, a theoretical model was developed to treat a simple deformation case {{of this kind of}} mechanically weak interface, in which the flexible layer has low stiffness to withstand deformation but no de-bonding or cracking. An infinite magnetostrictive plane with a circular inclusion was considered, where the matrix and inclusion are all general magnetostrictive materials which can be modeled by the standard square constitutive relation of magnetostriction. The binder layer of a certain thickness was modeled as a set of <b>springs</b> with no <b>thickness</b> but with an equivalent stiffness. The mathematical formulation was brought into the complex variable framework. The magnetoelastic field was solved and the effective magnetostriction was explicitly obtained. Comparisons with experimental results were also presented. In terms of this analysis, the interfacial stiffness has significant influences on the overall magnetostriction of composite. Increasing the interfacial stiffness can lead to large magnetostriction of composites.

The 2 D {{model of the}} substructure is a rigid central mass supported by J axisymmetrically placed linear springs. The response of the shell-spring-mass system {{is quite different from}} a fluid filled shell or that of a solid cylinder due to the discrete number of contact points which couple the displacement of the shell at different locations. Exterior acoustic scattering due to normal plane wave incidence is solved in closed form for arbitrary J. The scattering matrix associated with the normal mode solution displays a simple structure, composed of distinct sub-matrices which decouple the incident and scattered fields into J families. The presence of a springs-mass substructure causes resonances which are shown {{to be related to the}} subsonic shell flexural waves, and an approximate analytic expression is derived for the quasi-flexural resonance frequencies. Numerical simulations indicate that the new solution for J> 3 springs results in a complicated scattering response for plane wave incidence. As the number of springs becomes large enough, the total scattering cross-section is asymptotically zero at low frequencies and slightly increased compared to the empty shell at moderate frequencies due to the added stiffness and mass. It is also observed that the sensitivity to the angle of incidence diminishes as the number of springs is increased. This system can be tuned by selecting the shell <b>thickness,</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness and added mass to yield desired quasi-static effective properties making it a candidate element for graded index sonic crystals.

Rectangular areas of films were loaded in uniform compression and shear and the film properties were obtained through the load versus displacement response.

The experimental results were compared to theoretical predictions by modeling the nanostructured film elements as perfectly helical springs. The measurements were found to be typically within 20 % of the theoretically-predicted values, and spring equations consistently predicted the change in stiffness between films of different materials.

Thes differences {{are the result of}} secondary processes such as conductive cooling, mixing with colder shallower waters, and input of external CO 2, which affect each spring to a different extent in the terminal part of the thermal circuit. In this paper, the secondary processes that control the geochemical evolution of this system have been addressed using a geochemical dataset spanning over 20 years and combining different approaches: classical geochemical calculations and geochemical modelling. Mixing between a cold and a thermal end-member, cooling and CO 2 exchange are the processes affecting the spring waters with different intensity over time. These differences in the intensity of the secondary processes could be controlled by the effect of climate and indirectly by the geomorphological and hydrogeological setting of the different springs. Infiltration recharging the shallow aquifer is dominant during the rainy seasons and the extent of the mixing process is greater, at least in some springs. Moreover, significant rainfall can produce a decrease in the ground temperature favouring the conductive cooling. Finally, the geomorphological settings of the <b>springs</b> determine the <b>thickness</b> and the hydraulic properties of the saturated layer below them and, therefore, they affect the extent of the mixing process between the deep thermal waters and the shallower cold waters.

The MEMS variable capacitors are unique in its two-cavity design and use of electroplated nickel as the main structural material. The device consists of 2 x 2 mm² movable capacitive proof mass plates with a thickness of 30 [mu]m suspended between two fixed electrodes forming two vertical capacitors. When the capacitance increases for one cavity, it decreases for the other. This allows using both up and down directions to generate energy.

Five gold stoppers with height of 2 - 4 [mu]m were electroplated on the fixed plates to prevent snap-down of the movable plates by overwhelming electrostatic force.

In particular, the fabrication of three-dimensional (3 D) micro or nanostruc- tures with high aspect ratios is of growing interest in these fields. PBW is the only technique that has the capability to satisfy these requirements while providing full control of the geometrical parameters, such as the sur- face roughness and side wall angle. This technique is a direct microfabri- cation method that employs a focused, energetic (MeV) proton beam to structure the input pattern in resist materials. In the present work, a network of buried channels is fabricated {{as part of a}} project to develop a functional microfluidic device for neuronal studies and self-powered microfluidics (capillary micropump). Proton beam with energies of 0. 75 to 2. 5 MeV is used to fabricate the channels in 3 D with a minimum feature size of approximately 1 μm and depths of 40 to 60 μm. The roughness of the sidewalls of the written channels is approximately 3 nm root mean square roughness (Rrms). Radio frequency (RF) MEMS switches, which consist of an overhanging structure, are also written using PBW, and new MEMS switch designs are proposed. These designs are constructed so as to provide full control of the main cantilever beam parameters, such as the <b>thickness,</b> <b>spring</b> constant, and actuation. The three main stages of the lithography process, i. e., pre-exposure, expo- sure, and post-exposure, are investigated and optimised for application to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), pure SU- 8 polymer, and SU- 8 /silver- nanoparticle nanocomposites (SU- 8 /AgNp). During the exposure process, the proton beam energies, doses, and scanning method are also optimised, in order to attain a good-quality structure (i. e., a robust structure with smooth and straight walls). The mechanical and electrical properties of the nanocomposites, which are irradiated with a range of proton beam doses, are measured. Note that the structures written in this work are numerically validated prior to the writing process using COMSOL Multiphysics �R software. The fluid flow in the written buried channels is investigated using numerical methods...|$|R
