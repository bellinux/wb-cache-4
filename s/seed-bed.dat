40|$|Genetic {{variability}} among subspecies, ecotypes and populations is {{an important}} component of biodiversity, particularly when habitats are characterized by steep environmental gradients across short distances as in the landscape of the European Alps. In Poa alpina population differentiation is high due to polyploidy, facultative apomixis and the occurrence of <b>seed-</b> and bulbil-producing plants. We analyzed microsatellite diversity of <b>seed-</b> and bulbil-producing populations from two nearby alpine grassland sites in the Swiss Alps and transplanted them reciprocally to test the hypothesis that established plants are locally adapted. The <b>seed-</b> and bulbil-producing populations differed molecularly strongly from each other despite their proximity. The seed-producing plants from the rich, calcareous grassland site performed well at both the home and the away site. Conversely, the bulbil-producing plants from the species-poor grassland had a comparatively low productivity at both sites, but performed better at the high-quality away site compared to its home site. Thus, local adaptation of established plants could not be confirmed by reciprocal transplantation. Results suggest that the distribution of <b>seed-</b> and bulbil-producing P. alpina is a result of habitat quality, differences in plant performance, and the requirements for successful offspring recruitment. The prevailing occurrence of bulbil-producing plants at low productivity sites is probably due to different regeneration niches for seeds vs. bulbils, i. e. an advantage of bulbils at cold sites with poor soil and short growing seasons at this elevation...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between fungi and {{tropical}} trees help shape {{some of the}} most biodiverse communities on earth. These interactions occur in the presence of additional microbes that can modify fungal phenotypes, such as endohyphal bacteria (EHB). Here we examine the occurrence, diversity, and taxonomic composition of EHB in fungi that colonize seeds and leaves of plants in tropical forests. We use PCR and fluorescence microscopy to detect EHB in fungi, and a phylogenetic approach to explore evolutionary relationships among <b>seed-</b> and leaf-inhabiting fungi and their bacterial partners. Analyses focusing on two prevalent orders of fungi (Hypocreales and Xylariales) revealed that <b>seed-</b> and leaf-inhabiting fungi have a shared evolutionary history, yet differ in the prevalence, richness, and composition of their endohyphal symbionts. Phylogenetic analyses detected that the endohyphal habit is widespread, here encompassing members of seven phyla of bacteria (including three classes of Proteobacteria). Occurring in <b>seed-</b> vs. leaf-associated fungi has not resulted in detectable structure in the evolution of EHB, and no congruence was observed in the phylogenetic relationships of these apparently facultative, horizontally transmitted symbionts and their fungal hosts. Our results are consistent with multiple origins of fungus-bacterium associations and argue for evaluating focal pairs to determine how particular EHB affect the establishment or maintenance of fungal symbioses in seeds and leaves...|$|R
40|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) is an economically-important seed-borne {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} bacterial canker and bacterial wilt of tomato. In this study, a procedure {{was developed to}} generate tomato seed (internally-) infected with Cmm. These seeds {{can be used to}} evaluate methods for detection of Cmm in seed extracts, to study the effect of seed treatments and to study transmission from seed to seedlings. Seeds were subsequently wounded by scarification, softened by incubation on wetted blotting paper and inoculated with a Cmm suspension by vacuum-infiltration. To enhance growth of the Cmm in the seeds, they were incubated on wetted blotting paper or on a Cmm-selective medium. Directly after inoculation, densities were 104 cfu <b>seed-</b> 1 before or 103 cfu <b>seed-</b> 1 if seeds were disinfected. Incubation of seeds resulted in a strong increase of Cmm populations to densities up to 1010 cfu <b>seed-</b> 1 after three days. A GFP-tagged Cmm strain was used to visualise Cmm in plant material.

40|$|Seed size as {{determined}} by seed weight, is an important trait for trade and component of yield and adaptation in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Inheritance of seed size in chickpea was studied in a cross between ICC 11255, a normal seed size parent (average 120 mg <b>seed-</b> 1) and ICC 5002, a small seed size parent (average 50 mg <b>seed-</b> 1). Seed weight observations on individual plants of parents, F 1, F 2, and backcross generations, along with reciprocal cross generations revealed that the normal seed size was dominant over small seed size. No maternal effect was detected for seed size. The numbers of individuals with normal, small and medium (average 150 mg <b>seed-</b> 1) seed sizes in F 2 population were 1237, 323 and 111 fitting well to the expected ratio of 12 : 3 : 1 (χ 2 = 0. 923, P= 0. 630). The segregation data of backcross generations also indicated that seed size in chickpea was controlled by two genes with dominance epistasis. We designate the genotype of ICC 11255 as Sd 1 Sd 1 sd 2 sd 2, and ICC 5002 as sd 1 sd 1 Sd 2 Sd 2 wherein Sd 1 is epistatic to Sd 2 and sd 2 alleles...|$|R

60|$|Slight {{changes of}} {{treatment}} often suffice to induce variability. The simple fact {{of almost all}} our cultivated plants and domesticated animals having varied in all places and at all times, leads to this conclusion. Seeds taken from common English forest-trees, grown under their native climate, not highly manured or otherwise artificially treated, yield seedlings which vary much, as {{may be seen in}} every extensive <b>seed-bed.</b> I have shown in a former chapter what a number of well-marked and singular varieties the thorn (Crataegus oxycantha) has produced: yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation. In Staffordshire I carefully examined a large number of two British plants, namely Geranium phaeum and pyrenaicum, which have never been highly cultivated. These plants had spread spontaneously by seed from a common garden into an open plantation; and the seedlings varied in almost every single character, both in their flower and foliage, to a degree which I have never seen exceeded; yet they could not have been exposed to any great change in their conditions.|$|E
40|$|In pot {{and field}} {{experiments}} conducted in 1990 and 1991 on an acid sandy, phosphorus (P) deficient soil in Niger, West Africa, {{the effect of}} seed coating on seedling emergence, early growth and grain yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) was studied. Seeds of pearl millet were coated with different rates (0; 0. 5; 1. 0; 2. 0; 5. 0; 10. 0 mg P <b>seed–</b> 1) and types of P fertilizers (single superphosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate; monocalcium phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium triphosphate). Seedling emergence was generally reduced at coating rates higher than 0. 5 mg P <b>seed–</b> 1 and prevented with single superphosphate and sodium triphosphate at rates higher than 5 mg P <b>seed–</b> 1. No correlation {{was found between the}} pH and osmomolity of the coatings and final emergence of millet seedlings. The most favourable effect on plant growth and P content was achieved with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (AHP) as seed coating. This was attributed to the enhancement effect of ammonium on P uptake. Compared to the untreated control dry matter production at 20 days after planting (DAP) was increased by 280 %, P content per plant by 330 %, total biomass at maturity by 30 % and grain yield by 45 %. Although seed coating with AHP may be harmful to seedlings emergence, it represents a suitable method to enhance early growth and increase yield of pearl millet...|$|R

6000|$|Hence, {{after having}} {{carefully}} compared numerous varieties, I {{gave up the}} attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist. Most of the varieties present such inconstant characters, that when grown in poor soil, or when flowering out of their proper season, they produced differently coloured and much smaller flowers. Cultivators speak {{of this or that}} kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by this they do not mean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its character by seed, but that the individual plant does not change much under culture. The principle of inheritance, however, does hold good to a certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the Heartsease, for to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good sorts. Nevertheless, in almost every large <b>seed-bed</b> a few, almost wild seedlings reappear through reversion. On comparing the choicest varieties with the nearest allied wild forms, besides the difference in the size, outline, and colour of the flowers, the leaves sometimes differ in shape, as does the calyx occasionally in the length and breadth of the sepals. The differences {{in the form of the}} nectary more especially deserve notice; because characters derived from this organ have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of Viola. In a large number of flowers compared in 1842 I found that in the greater number the nectary was straight; in others the extremity was a little turned upwards, or downwards, or inwards, so as to be completely hooked; in others, instead of being hooked, it was first turned rectangularly downwards, and then backwards and upwards; in others, the extremity was considerably enlarged; and lastly, in some the basal part was depressed, becoming, as usual, laterally compressed towards the extremity. In a large number of flowers, on the other hand, examined by me in 1856 from a nursery-garden in a different part of England, the nectary hardly varied at all. Now M. Gay says that in certain districts, especially in Auvergne, the nectary of the wild V. grandiflora varies in the manner just described. Must we conclude from this that the cultivated varieties first mentioned were all descended from V. grandiflora, and that the second lot, though having the same general appearance, were descended from V. tricolor, of which the nectary, according to M. Gay, is subject to little variation? Or is it not more probable that both these wild forms would be found under other conditions to vary in the same manner and degree, thus showing that they ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct? ...|$|E
