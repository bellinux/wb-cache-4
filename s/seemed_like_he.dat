He called T'Pol [...] "Seven of Vulcan", and said the main issue with the series was the [...] "subpar" [...] writing. In this episode, he felt that Tucker was written so poorly that Trineer <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was overacting to compensate for it.|$|E

500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's... Todd was cool and he was a producer." [...] Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: [...] "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could handle the pace." [...] Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that [...] "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York".|$|E

Collins said that [...] "a number of times" [...] the jurors asked themselves, [...] "what is [...] doing here? Where is Rove and all these other guys.

2500|$|Beginning in 1888, Tradem also {{authored}} short {{memoirs of}} his many meetings with Macedonski, in particular of their conversations. He recalled being familiar with many of Macedonski's original theories on various subjects, including astronomy and the works of Camille Flammarion. Demetrescu noted that Macedonski's theories claimed to explain {{the workings of the}} Universe in [...] "a different way" [...] and based [...] "on his imagination", but argued that [...] "for a moment , it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could convince anyone". He also recorded that the theistic Macedonski answered [...] "positive science" [...] with [...] "the grin of skepticism". Nevertheless, according to Tradem, Alexandru Macedonski flirted with Naturalism during the early part of his career, and admired the works of Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola. His memoirs also provided detail on Macedonski's interest in visual arts, indicating that the older poet had always wished to become a painter, and that his determination had instead shaped the artistic career of his son Alexis.|$|E

In comparison, Pruett felt that Triple H came across as [...] "the conquering hero" [...] and [...] "avenging party" [...] in the storyline against Reigns. Regarding Dean Ambrose, Pruett felt he [...] "was presented {{as more of a}} star on this show than he has been in a long time", commenting that [...] "unlike Roman Reigns, who walked away, Ambrose fought hard and still kept fighting to the end". He {{described the}} opening match between Ambrose and Owens as [...] "insane". Pruett wrote that the re-debuting AJ Styles [...] "instantly <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> fit on the roster", but noted that he was [...] "not presented in the upper echelon of WWE". For other matches, Pruett called Kalisto's win [...] "a major surprise"; while lamenting that [...] "the lines of the WWE women's division were blurred once again" [...] as to who fans should support between Sasha Banks and Charlotte after their post-match antics.|$|E

[...] MSNBC {{issued a statement saying}} that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014.
