25|$|The use of {{seawater}} has {{the potential}} to make uranium chemistry more complex; in pure water the hydrogen peroxide formed by the radiolysis of water can react with uranium dioxide to form a solid peroxide mineral known as studtite. According to Navrotsky et al. this mineral has been found in the fuel <b>storage</b> <b>pond</b> at the plutonium production site at Hanford. Navrotsky et al. report that when alkali metal ions are present, uranium can form nanoparticles (U60 clusters) which may be more mobile than the solid studtite.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the potentiality of robotics technologies for <b>storage</b> <b>ponds</b> of nuclear material through a demonstration prototype {{developed at the}} EC-Joint Research Centre (JRC) {{in the framework of}} JRC’s R&D activities. The presented robotics prototype, named SiLab Robotics Arm (SIROARM), is intended for the automated inspection of spent nuclear fuel canisters submerged in <b>storage</b> <b>ponds</b> using a reading system for sealing bolts developed at the JRC Seals and Identification Laboratory. This system is designed to be installed on a crane bridge and to replace the operator in the seals-checking process which is a difficult, tiresome and risky task. Practicality of the implementation of this system in real-life environments is discussed including integration, maintenance, safety and operation aspects. Further enabling developments are also outlined. As a conclusion, the paper demonstrates that the implementation of robotics systems is feasible and that it brings advantages on operation and personnel safety but also in terms of storage security through permanent material control and limited access, which are a few relevant aspects for both plant operators and safeguards authorities.
