However, Stewart argues that [...] "they did much more, they added provisions that the convention never discussed, they changed critical agreements that the delegates had already approved. Spurred by Rutledge, they reconvened the powers of the national government, redefined the powers of the states, and adopted fresh concessions on that most explosive issue, slavery.

In addition, when it awarded a fiscal year 2007 Contract modification for nonseverable services, NIAID initially funded only $40.3 {{million of the}} $220.5 million contract obligation with fiscal year 2007 appropriations. Because the Contract was a nonseverable service contract, which represents a <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> and provides for a single outcome, NIAID was required to record the full amount of the Contract using fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2007 appropriated funds. By not doing so, NIAID potentially violated the Antideficiency Act. NIAID complied with the purpose requirements of appropriations statutes. …In written comments on our draft report, NIH agreed that an Antideficiency Act violation had occurred but did not concur with our findings and recommendations regarding the characterization of the Contract as a nonseverable service contract.

NIAID obligated a total of $20.0 million {{in violation of the}} bona fide needs rule: $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 appropriated funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 appropriated funds. NIAID planned to obligate future-year appropriated funds as well. Because the Contract was a nonseverable service contract (a <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> that provides for a single outcome chargeable to the fiscal year in which the contract is awarded), NIAID was required to record the full amount of the Contract using fiscal year 2006 appropriated funds. By not doing so, NIAID potentially violated the Antideficiency Act. (When services are severable they are continuing and recurring and chargeable to the fiscal year in which the services are provided.) NIAID complied with the purpose requirements of appropriations statutes.We recommended that NIAID (1) deobligate $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 funds, (2) record the remaining $30.0 million of the $49.8 million Contract obligation against fiscal year 2006 funds, and (3) report an Antideficiency Act violation if fiscal year 2006 funds are not available.NIH concurred with the findings that the Contract is nonseverable and that it should have been funded at the time the Contract was awarded. NIH said that the Department of Health and Human Services would report the violation as required. NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 4 years of the Contract.|$|E
40|$|The {{negotiation}} structure at the World Trade Organization (WTO) primarily {{relies on}} the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking,</b> an all or nothing approach that typically precludes separate agreements {{among some of the}} parties or on some of the agenda items. This article argues for a re-examination {{of the value of the}} <b>single</b> <b>undertaking,</b> particularly with reference to developing country Members. With respect to the substantive negotiations, 'linkage' (the inter-dependent regulation of trade and other fields that are deemed to have an impact on trade) has been a powerful principle for the expansion of WTO regulation and the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> has, so far, served as the vector to implement linkage. As a counterpoint, this article argues that linkage can [...] and should be [...] decoupled from negotiation design, particularly from the unquestioned and systematic recourse to the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking.</b> The article offers avenues for redesigning negotiations beyond the old dichotomy of the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> versus 'à-la-carte' approaches. It proposes alternative negotiation structures that take into account the practical realities of many WTO Members with limited institutional capacity as well as the desirability for some Members to liberalize trade at a faster pace.

40|$|Nothing is agreed until {{everything}} is agreed. Negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) proceed simultaneously, not sequentially, and all Members must accept all the results. I {{show that the}} so-called <b>Single</b> <b>Undertaking</b> is both a negotiation technique and a constitutive metaphor. It does not cause an outcome to negotiations, whether in a round or the daily life of the WTO, but it shapes {{the possibility of an}} outcome. The methodological innovation of the article is the use of counterfactual analysis to assess whether the <b>Single</b> <b>Undertaking</b> can be relaxed using concepts suggested by the various critiques. I consider rounds of negotiations, the consensus principle, diffuse reciprocity, critical mass decision making, the WTO acquis and special and differential treatment for developing countries. One aspect of integrative bargaining strategies, issue linkage, is also considered.

40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement was {{accepted}} as a <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> and the Doha Round is also treated as a <b>single</b> <b>undertaking.</b> That {{does not imply that}} any eventual results of the current negotiations can be seamlessly integrated into the existing WTO agreements {{all at the same time}} and for all Members at the same time. The procedures used to implement the results of the Uruguay Round will not necessarily be available within the constraints of the WTO's institutional structure. Conversely, the procedures that are available within the WTO framework were not designed for the purpose of implementing the results of a comprehensive round of trade negotiations and preserving an overall balance of concessions embodied in multiple legal forms. This means that implementation will alter the multilateral nature of the WTO as it presently stands. WTO Members may yet be at liberty to revert to earlier approaches to implementation which are better adapted to the logic underlying the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> approach.

40|$|The {{demand for}} trade {{policy in the}} {{developed}} countries is such that possible Wto agreements include many regulatory issues. On the other hand, regulation is development related in many ways: the "best " rule may vary with the level of development, the opportunity cost of establishing regulation varies with income levels and, finally, liberalisation of regulatory protection between countries at different levels of development is likely to take the form of hegemonic harmonisation. Special and differential treatment for the developing countries could provide solutions but Sdt is flawed because of two mutually reinforcing ambiguities: first, it applies to a set of countries with widely different levels of development, {{on the basis of a}} self selection; second, its provisions for positive action on the part of developed countries are mostly not legally enforceable. The status quo tends to be defended by the developing countries as for the first ambiguity, by the developed countries as for the second. Therefore, the expansion of the agenda within the framework of the <b>single</b> <b>undertaking</b> rule, coupled with scant liberalisation in agriculture has produced constant tension up to the Cancun failure.

Mode 4 negotiation started from the trade perspective, however, since Mode 4 involves international labor migration, it also has migration perspective. Thus developed countries, that have competitiveness in service sector, are interested in free movement of skilled workers such as intra-company transferees and business visitors. On the other hand, developing countries, that have little competitiveness in service sector, are interested in free movement of low-skilled workers. Empirical studies predict {{that the benefits of}} Mode 4 liberalization will be focused on developed countries rather than developing countries. The latter may suffer from brain drain and reduction of labor supply. Nevertheless developed countries are reluctant to Mode 4 negotiation because they can utilize skilled workers from developing countries by use of their own temporary visa programs. They are interested in Mode 4 related with Mode 3 in order to ease direct investment and movement of natural persons to developing countries.
