5|$|Teresa Cristina {{had grown}} to be {{a vital part of}} PedroII's family life and routine. She never filled the roles of romantic lover or {{intellectual}} partner, however. Her devotion to the Emperor remained firm, though <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> being supplanted. She continued to appear with the Emperor in public, and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration. She was not rejected or slighted, but the relationship had changed. Pedro II treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's first {{policy toward}} Scotland was {{to oppose the}} French {{presence}} there. <b>She</b> <b>feared</b> that the French planned to invade England and put Mary, Queen of Scots, who was {{considered by many to}} be the heir to the English crown, on the throne. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E
5|$|LeToya Luckett and Roberson became {{unhappy with}} Mathew's {{managing}} {{of the band}} and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted {{for a couple of}} years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> no one would take her seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|On Midsummer 1953 Gardner invited Valiente {{again to}} Woodford-Grimes's house, {{and it was}} here that he {{initiated}} her into Wicca in a ritual during which they stood before an altar and he read from his Book of Shadows. The three of them then set off to the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where they witnessed the Druids performing a ritual there. Gardner had lent a ritual sword which he owned to the Druids, who placed it within the monument's Heel Stone during their rite. Valiente told her husband and mother about the visit to Stonehenge, but not about her initiation, of which, <b>she</b> <b>feared,</b> they would not have approved.|$|E
5|$|Paul and Helen {{move to the}} United States, marry, and Helen {{gives birth}} to the narrator. However, she becomes {{depressed}} a few months afterwards. She later confesses that <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> the taint of the vampiric bite that she acquired earlier would infect her child. The family travels to Europe {{in an attempt to}} cheer her up. When they visit the monastery Saint-Matthieu-des-Pyrénées-Orientales, Helen feels Dracula's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff. Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{spent her}} days writing; her main project {{was a book}} about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also {{maintained}} an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary {{as part of the}} Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E

5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E
5|$|The novel recaps Penelope's life in {{hindsight}} from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, {{her marriage to}} Odysseus, her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, {{even though he was}} mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. <b>She</b> <b>feared</b> violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but {{on the issue of the}} maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.|$|E

25|$|Although Martin {{appointed}} Aboriginal Territorians to her cabinet, she {{has been}} criticised for not improving the lot of her Aboriginal constituents, the majority of whom have a life expectancy well below that of white Australians.

25|$|This was a {{persistent}} irritation for Meck {{and not necessarily}} a warning of her cutting off her patronage of Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, one logical explanation of giving him a year's allowance at once would be that <b>she</b> <b>feared</b> not having the funds to send later, in their usual arrangement of monthly installments. Others discount this idea. Most tellingly, Meck asked Tchaikovsky, in her final letter, not to forget her.|$|E
