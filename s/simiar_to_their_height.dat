Methods: N = 76 10 -year-old children were taught the SR {{and then asked}} <b>to</b> estimate <b>their</b> sun-cast shadow length relative <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>height</b> and whether this meant they should seek shade.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the class of "deco" polyominoes and the {{succession}} rule describing their construction. These polyominoes are enumerated according <b>to</b> <b>their</b> directed <b>height</b> by factorial numbers. By changing {{some aspects of the}} "factorial" rule, we obtain some succession rules that describe various "deco" polyomino subclasses. By enumerating the subclasses according <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>height</b> and width, we find the following well-known numbers: Stirling numbers of the first and second kind, Narayana and odd index Fibonacci numbers. We wish to point out how the changes made on the original succession rule yield some new succession rules that produce transcendental, algebraic and rational generating functions...|$|R
