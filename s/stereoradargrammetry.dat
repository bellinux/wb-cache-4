40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the performance of stereoradargrammetric methods applied to spaceborne monostatic–bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for digital elevation model (DEM) generation. Stereoradargrammetric techniques for robust DEM generation were successfully experienced on monostatic repeat-pass SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C/X-SAR, ERS 1 / 2, JERS- 1, and Radarsat data. However, novel configurations achievable by modern spacecraft flying in formation will allow for the attainment of very large baselines between the antennas in a single-pass bistatic geometry so that the height determination accuracy can benefit from both stereo effect and simultaneous acquisition. Fivemodels for relief reconstruction by monostatic–bistatic SAR <b>stereoradargrammetry</b> are presented, and an error budget is assessed for each of them. Results of the sensitivity analysis exhibit metric accuracy, and therefore, the technique could be applied for height reconstruction as a methodology complementary to SAR interferometry...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for a controlled experiment {{with a pair}} of overlapping lunar ALSE-VHF images produced in two consecutive revolutions of the Apollo command module around the moon. A theoretical treatment is presented of the mathematical tools for ALSE radargrammetry. Evaluation of radargrammetric mapping with single strips and a radar stereo model led to preliminary results in a test area around Mons Maraldi. Accuracy achieved with single radar images was about plus or minus 250 m along track and plus or minus 500 m across track. <b>Stereoradargrammetry</b> was used to generate a contour plot of Mons Maraldi and to evaluate the overall height accuracy obtainable from ALSE radar. About plus or minus 120 m of accuracy is obtained if the stereo model is corrected using a few control points. This makes ALSE stereo radar heights competitive with or even superior to vidicon data obtained for planetary exploration. The present basic limitation to radargrammetric accuracy from ALSE-VHF images is the identifiability of surface features...|$|E
