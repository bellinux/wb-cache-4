50|$|In {{competition}} the forelock is braided for <b>some</b> events, <b>such</b> {{as those}} in the dressage and hunt seat disciplines. Conversely, <b>some</b> breeds, <b>such</b> as the Andalusian, are usually shown with a long, full, forelock that is never braided. Other breeds may confine the forelock with rubber bands and anchor it to the bridle. The forelock may also be roached (shaved off) in <b>some</b> competitions, <b>such</b> as polo.|$|R
5000|$|In the 4th and 5th centuries, <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> as Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor {{held that}} human life already began at conception, <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> as Lactantius - {{following}} Aristotle's view - spoke rather {{of the soul}} that was [...] "infused" [...] in forty days or more, and <b>some</b> writers <b>such</b> as Jerome and Augustine of Hippo left {{the mystery of the}} timing of the infusion to God.|$|R
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as cactuses, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as truffles, are esteemed as costly delicacies. A few {{species such}} as Agaricus bisporus and oyster {{mushrooms}} (Pleurotus spp.) are cultivated.|$|E

50|$|As {{different}} member {{churches of}} the Anglican Communion have different policies on {{the ordination of}} women, there are <b>some</b> churches (<b>such</b> as the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone) and <b>some</b> dioceses (<b>such</b> as Sydney) in which women may be ordained deacons, but not priests or bishops.|$|R
5|$|The New World warblers are a {{group of}} small, often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are arboreal but <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as the ovenbird, are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores. Forty species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The massif is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of private {{railways}} have also existed at various times. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company, and the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company and St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company were acquired by the Victorian Railways and made part of the core state network in 1860 and 1878 respectively. Other country branch lines were also built by private companies: namely the Kerang-Koondrook Tramway and the Deniliquin and Moama Railway, both not being acquired until the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>some</b> words, <b>such</b> as hamer, short [...] is in free {{variation}} with long [...] {{despite the fact}} that the spelling suggests the latter. In <b>some</b> words, <b>such</b> as laat, the pronunciation with short [...] occurs only in colloquial language. In <b>some</b> other words, <b>such</b> as aambeeld [...] 'anvil', the pronunciation with short [...] is already a part of the standard language. The shortening of [...] has been noted as early as 1927.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{all nations}} use {{standard}} time zones for secular purposes, {{but they do}} not all apply the concept as originally conceived. North Korea, Newfoundland, India, Iran, Afghanistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, the Marquesas, as well as parts of Australia use half-hour deviations from standard time, and <b>some</b> nations, <b>such</b> as Nepal, and <b>some</b> provinces, <b>such</b> as the Chatham Islands of New Zealand, use quarter-hour deviations. <b>Some</b> countries, <b>such</b> as China and India, use a single time zone even though the extent of their territory far exceeds 15° of longitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> programs, <b>such</b> as Food Stamps, are {{appropriated}} entitlements. <b>Some</b> mandatory spending, <b>such</b> as Congressional salaries, is {{not part}} of any entitlement program. Funds to make federal interest payments have been automatically appropriated since 1847.|$|R
5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E
5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E

5|$|Assessments of Sorabji's music vary widely. While <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as {{the pianist}} John Ogdon and the organist Kevin Bowyer, speak {{of him as}} {{comparable}} to such composers as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others dismiss him altogether. Reviews of concerts featuring Sorabji's music tend to be similarly mixed, some reviewers elevating him to the ranks of figures such as Debussy, and others describing his music as vacuous.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though <b>some</b> <b>such</b> as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general {{anatomy of a}} beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as the cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

5|$|Companies closely {{associated}} with camouflage patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, Stüssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and overprinting genuine military surplus fabric; others use camouflage patterns in bright colours such as pink or purple. <b>Some,</b> <b>such</b> as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{lasted for}} {{nine and a}} half years, from April 1902 until October 1911, with the tower {{construction}} alone taking three years (1908–11). Different departments of the city administration moved in at different times with <b>some,</b> <b>such</b> as the police department, moving in as early as March 1908.

5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are <b>some</b> <b>such</b> as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
