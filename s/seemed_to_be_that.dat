5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned {{a hole in the}} fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
500|$|In Our Time {{was ignored}} and {{forgotten}} by literary critics for decades. Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the next year, {{is considered the}} more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than [...] "sophisticated, complex design"; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' {{attention away from the}} book as an entity, toward the individual stories. In 1962, when Scribner's released the paperback edition of In Our Time, it began to be taught in American universities, {{and by the end of}} the decade, the first critical study of the collection appeared. Benson describes the collection as the author's first [...] "major achievement"; Wagner-Martin as [...] "his most striking work, both in terms of personal involvement and technical innovation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to England, Macnaghten was offered the post of first Assistant Chief Constable (CID) in the Metropolitan Police by Monro, who by that time had become the first Assistant Commissioner (Crime); however this {{appointment}} was opposed by Charles Warren, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, allegedly due to the beating he took by [...] "the Hindoos" [...] back in Bengal; but the real reason <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Warren and Monro did not get along well from the beginning. Warren's rejection of Macnaghten widened the rift between the two men, resulting in Monro's resignation and his transfer to Special Branch by the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews.|$|E

2500|$|Bortkiewicz's {{analysis}} nevertheless {{raised the}} very important {{question of what}} the point of Marx's value theory is. Is there is any real difference between Marx's [...] "values" [...] and theoretical prices? If {{there is no real}} difference, neo-Ricardians argued, then Marx's value theory is redundant; one could then just as well make all the same sorts of arguments in price terms. The advantage <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> there exists no [...] "transformation problem" [...] of converting values into prices through a quantitative adjustment anymore, and that value theory could be replaced with equilibrium theory to explain prices, since [...] "value" [...] then simply stood for [...] "equilibrium prices" [...] (such as the Smithian or Ricardian [...] "natural prices"). One could then create a system of equilibrium prices for the critical variables involved in production, to explain price relationships. However, then Marx's theory of the formation of a general rate of profit, and his theory of the TRPF, would no longer be valid.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1999, Kockums was {{controlled}} by the Swedish state through the company Svenska Varv AB. Having implemented a highly advanced variety of the Stirling engine for low noise submarine propulsion, Kockums was considered to have strategic value for the Swedish Navy. However, in 1999, Kockums' main competitor on the submarine market, the German ship-building company HDW, acquired Kockums. In 2005, HDW was bought by the German industrial conglomerate Thyssen Krupp. The time after 1999 was beridden with conflicts between Kockums' only Swedish customer, the Defence Materiel Administration (Sweden) (FMV), and Kockums' German owners. The Swedish view was that the technical advancements made in collaboration between Kockums and FMV ought {{to be used to}} create a new generation of submarine for lucrative export: the A26 submarine. On the German side, the A26 project was said to be regarded as a high-risk project that could lead to uncontrollably growing costs. Superficially, the major source of conflict <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> neither ThyssenKrupp nor FMV would accept carrying unforeseen development costs. [...] As several technical innovations to be implemented in the A26 were kept in classified status at the FMV, ThyssenKrupp argued that the implied costs were too difficult to predict. [...] This deadlock persisted for months until the FMV decided to cancel the order of the A26 submarines.|$|E

50|$|As of March, 2009, {{the number}} of {{counties}} that have sentenced pursuant Measure 57 sentences remains small.

2500|$|Apparently the Latin is not first rate having four syllables in [...] "cruce tuti" [...] but {{the meaning}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the Lowland Strathclyde Britons on the {{southern}} shore and the Highland Pictish Scots on the northern shore stand protected from each other by their common Christianity.|$|R
