Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and <b>surimi.</b> Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E

25|$|Cochineal {{is one of}} the few {{water-soluble}} colourants {{to resist}} degradation with time. It {{is one of the}} most light- and heat-stable and oxidation-resistant of all the natural organic colourants and is even more stable than many synthetic food colours. The water-soluble form is used in alcoholic drinks with calcium carmine; the insoluble form is used in a wide variety of products. Together with ammonium carmine, they can be found in meat, sausages, processed poultry products (meat products cannot be coloured in the United States unless they are labeled as such), <b>surimi,</b> marinades, alcoholic drinks, bakery products and toppings, cookies, desserts, icings, pie fillings, jams, preserves, gelatin desserts, juice beverages, varieties of cheddar cheese and other dairy products, sauces, and sweets.|$|E
25|$|A {{schooling}} {{species that}} predominantly inhabits inshore waters, the yellowstripe scad is a predatory fish, taking crustaceans, small fish {{and a variety}} of other planktonic prey. Feeding occurs at different times of the day and night throughout its range. The species reaches sexual maturity at around 8–13cm, with spawning in India shown to occur in two peak periods between January to April and July to October. The yellowstripe scad is an important commercial species, with between 113,000 t and 195,000 t reported worldwide between 1990 and 2010. The species is predominantly harvested with trawls, however is also taken with smaller traditional nets. The yellowstripe scad is marketed fresh, frozen, as a dried fish snack as well as several novel ways including fish powder, <b>surimi</b> and burgers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} {{is a dark}} fleshed species of fair eating quality. The species is marketed {{in a variety of}} ways apart from being sold fresh or frozen at market. The yellowstripe scad is {{commonly}} used as a dried fish snack in Asian countries, processed either by salting, curing or mechanical drying, with extensive trials on the optimum conditions and chemical agents for production. The yellowtail scad has also been part of trials into use as fish powder, with a high protein content considered to make the species a candidate. The fat content of the powder can be reduced by treatment, but this negatively affects solubility and other properties. With high lipid and myoglobin content, the species has been considered a poor candidate for <b>surimi</b> (seafood sticks) in the past, however experiments with heating of the <b>surimi</b> gel have shown that this can improve its properties and make it more cohesive.|$|E
50|$|In the West, <b>surimi</b> {{products}} {{usually are}} imitation seafood products, such as crab, abalone, shrimp, calamari, and scallop. Several companies do produce <b>surimi</b> sausages, luncheon meats, hams, and burgers. Some examples include Salmolux salmon burgers and SeaPak <b>surimi</b> ham, salami, and rolls. A patent was issued {{for the process}} of making even higher-quality proteins from fish such as in the making of imitation steak from <b>surimi.</b> <b>Surimi</b> is also used to make kosher imitation shrimp and crabmeat, using only kosher fish such as pollock.|$|E
50|$|Although seen less {{commonly}} in Japanese and Western markets, pork <b>surimi</b> (肉漿) is {{a common}} product found in {{a wide array of}} Chinese foods. The process of making pork <b>surimi</b> is similar to making fish <b>surimi</b> except that leaner cuts of meat are used and rinsing is omitted. Pork <b>surimi</b> is made into pork balls (Chinese: gòngwán; 貢丸) which, when cooked, have a texture similar to fish balls, but are much firmer and denser.|$|E
5000|$|In Chinese cuisine, fish <b>surimi,</b> {{often called}} [...] "fish paste", is used {{directly}} as stuffing or made into balls. Balls made from lean beef (牛肉丸, lit. [...] "beef ball") and pork <b>surimi</b> often {{are seen in}} Chinese cuisine. Fried, steamed, and boiled <b>surimi</b> products also are found commonly in Southeast Asian cuisine.|$|E
5000|$|The industrialized surimi-making {{process was}} refined in 1969 by Nishitani Yōsuke of Japan's Hokkaidō Fisheries Experiment Institute {{to process the}} {{increased}} catch of fish, to revitalize Japan's fish industry, and {{to make use of}} what used to be considered [...] "fodder fish". <b>Surimi</b> industrial technology developed by Japan in the early 1960s promoted the growth of the <b>surimi</b> industry. The successful growth of the industry was based on the Alaska pollock (or walleye pollock). Subsequently, production of Alaska pollock <b>surimi</b> declined and was supplemented by <b>surimi</b> production using other species.|$|E
5000|$|Surimi: <b>Surimi</b> and surimi-based {{products}} are {{an example of}} value added products. <b>Surimi</b> is prepared from the mechanically deboned, washed (bleached) and stabilised flesh of fish. [...] "It is an intermediate product used {{in the preparation of}} a variety of ready to eat seafood such as kamaboko, fish sausage, crab legs and imitation shrimp products. Surimi-based {{products are}} gaining more prominence worldwide, because of the emergence of Japanese restaurants and culinary traditions in North America, Europe and elsewhere. Ideally, <b>surimi</b> should be made from low-value, white fish with excellent gelling ability and which are abundant and available year-round. At present, Alaskan pollack accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} <b>surimi</b> supply. Other species, such as sardine, mackerel, barracuda, striped mullet have been successfully used for <b>surimi</b> production." ...|$|E
5000|$|In North America and Europe, <b>surimi</b> also {{alludes to}} fish-based {{products}} manufactured using this process. A generic term for fish-based <b>surimi</b> in Japanese is [...] "fish-puréed products" [...] (魚肉練り製品 gyoniku neri seihin).|$|E
5000|$|Pork <b>surimi</b> also {{is mixed}} with flour and water to make a type of {{dumpling}} wrapper called [...] "yànpí" [...] (燕皮 or 肉燕皮) that has the similar firm and bouncy texture of cooked <b>surimi.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Beef <b>surimi</b> {{also can}} be shaped into a ball form to make [...] "beef balls" [...] (牛肉丸). When beef <b>surimi</b> is mixed with chopped beef tendons and formed into balls, [...] "beef tendon balls" [...] (牛筋丸) are produced. Both of these {{products}} commonly are used in Chinese hot pot as well as served in Vietnamese [...] "phở". Bakso, made from beef <b>surimi,</b> is a popular common food found in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>surimi</b> is to {{be packed}} and frozen, {{food-grade}} cryoprotectants are added as preservatives while the meat paste is being mixed. Under most circumstances, <b>surimi</b> is processed immediately into a formed and cured product.|$|E
50|$|Two {{to three}} {{million tons of}} fish from around the world, amounting to 2-3 {{percent of the world}} fisheries' supply, are used for the {{production}} of <b>surimi</b> and surimi-based products. The United States and Japan are major producers of <b>surimi</b> and surimi-based products. Thailand has become an important producer. China’s role as producer is increasing. Many newcomers to the <b>surimi</b> industry have emerged, including Lithuania, Vietnam, Chile, the Faroe Islands, France, and Malaysia.|$|E
50|$|In Asian cultures, <b>surimi</b> is eaten {{as a food}} in its {{own right}} and seldom used to imitate other foods. In Japan, fish cakes (kamaboko) and fish sausages, as well as other {{extruded}} fish products, are commonly sold as cured <b>surimi.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fujimitsu Corporation (Fujimitsu kabushiki-gaisha) is a {{manufacturer}} of fish <b>surimi</b> products based {{in the city of}} Nagato, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. In 2008, it was Japan's eighth largest <b>surimi</b> manufacturer in terms of sales. The company's products include <b>surimi</b> standards such as kamaboko, chikuwa, and imitation crab as well as original products, such as Cheese Colone, which are bite-size balls of kamaboko with a cheese food filling. Fujimitsu's Cheese Colone won a bronze medal from Monde Selection in 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Surimi</b> is {{a useful}} {{ingredient}} for producing various kinds of processed foods. It allows a manufacturer to imitate the texture and taste of a more expensive product, such as lobster tail, using a relatively low-cost material. <b>Surimi</b> is an inexpensive source of protein.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{kinds of}} fish, {{such as the}} Pacific whiting, cannot form firm <b>surimi</b> without {{additives}} such as egg white or potato starch. Before the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease), it was an industrial practice to add bovine blood plasma into the fish paste to help its curing or gel-forming. Today some manufacturers may use a transglutaminase to improve the texture of <b>surimi.</b> Although illegal, the practice of adding borax to fish balls and <b>surimi</b> to heighten the bouncy texture of the fish balls and whiten the product is widespread in Asia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{processing}} of imitation crabmeat {{begins with the}} skinning and boning of the fish. Then the meat is minced and rinsed, and the water is leached out. This creates a thick paste called <b>surimi.</b> The word means [...] "minced fish" [...] in Japanese, and the essential techniques for making it were developed in Japan over 800 years ago. <b>Surimi</b> is commonly used in Japan to make a type of fish ball or cake called kamaboko. In 1975, a method for processing imitation crabmeat from <b>surimi</b> was invented in Japan, and in 1983, American companies started production.|$|E
