30|$|The study {{started out}} with a goals of {{answering}} the overall research questions (RQ- 1) of whether analytical programming technique outperformed the <b>standard</b> UCP <b>equation.</b> This question is answered in the result section. If the UCP method is optimized, via calibrating weight or via production factor, the analytical programming method is not efficient enough to outperform <b>standard</b> UCP <b>equation.</b> The evidence can be seen in result section in Table 10. As can be seen in this table, there is no fitness function with less median value then the <b>standard</b> UCP <b>equation</b> has on the significance level 95  %. On the other hand, if the productivity factor and the whole UCP is set to default value, there is a possibility, that model built by analytical programming outperform the <b>standard</b> UCP <b>equation</b> with any of proposed fitness functions.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} recent {{work on the}} Dirac {{equation}} in a curved spacetime. In addition to the <b>standard</b> <b>equation,</b> two alternative versions are considered, derived from wave mechanics, {{and based on the}} tensor representation of the Dirac field. The latter considers the Dirac wave function as a spacetime vector and the set of the Dirac matrices as a third-order tensor. Having the probability current conserved for any solution of the Dirac equation gives an equation to be satisfied by the coefficient fields. A positive definite scalar product is defined and a hermiticity condition for the Dirac Hamiltonian is derived for a general coordinate system in a general curved spacetime. For the <b>standard</b> <b>equation,</b> the hermiticity of the Dirac Hamiltonian is not preserved under all admissible changes of the coefficient fields. Comment: 8 pages in standard LaTeX.
