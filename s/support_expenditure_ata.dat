40|$|Based on {{the account}} of the vital role which the {{national}} finance played in supporting agriculture, the thesis presents the current situation of financial support for agriculture in China, in terms of the limited scale and irrational structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture. On the basis of the brief introduction of the current level of Chinese farmers’ income, the thesis discusses the effects of scale and irrational structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture on the farmers’ income, according to the related data of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture and rural per capita net income. The results indicate that the calculating regression equation has a remarkable explanation power, reflecting the positive role of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture played by national finance in increasing the farmers’ income. As regards the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture at present, according to the proportion from high to low, the expenditure primarily consists of three parts from high to low in sequence as follows: productive expenditure and funds for public undertakings, capital construction expenditure, and rural relief expenditure plus science and technology funds. Such sequence deviates from the marginal production effects of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture and the correlation of farmers’ income, which demonstrates the severe irrationality of the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward as follows: on one hand, we should continue intensifying the efforts to support agriculture financially in order to form a regular increase mechanism; on the other hand, we should adjust and optimize the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture, and further crystallize the investment flows.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between institutional characteristics (institutional selectivity, faculty and financial characteristics) and retention and 6 -year graduation rates at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Institutional financial characteristics (instructional, academic support, student services and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures)</b> were examined from two perspectives: (1) The relationship {{between the amount of}} money spent per student and retention and graduation rates and (2) The relationship between the percentage of institutional expenditures and retention and graduation rates. I estimate 6 -year graduation rates and 1 -year retention rates in 2009 for HBCUs in the sample using multiple linear-regression. This study has two research questions: 1. 	Do institutional selectivity, faculty characteristics and financial characteristics spent per student significantly predict 6 -year graduation rates at HBCUs and UNCF institutions? 2. 	Do institutional selectivity, faculty characteristics and the percentage of expenditures significantly predict first year retention rates at HBCUs and UNCF institutions? Key Findings and Implications This paper found that there is a relationship between institutional selectivity, faculty and financial expenditures on graduation and retention rates. When 6 -year graduation rate was the variable of influence, percentage female, accreditation, open admission, and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> were found to be significant across both, the all HBCU and UNCF sets of data. In general there was a direct relationship between percentage female and graduation rates. This finding was consistent with much of the research on graduation rates that show that women graduate at higher rates than men. Institutional selectivity exerted a significant influence on graduation rates. Implications If improving retention and graduation rates is an institutional goal, then strategies to reduce institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> and evaluate the percentage of staff dedicated to instruction is warranted. Similarly, the findings suggest directions for future research that may tease out some of the organizational, pedagogical and policy features of HBCUS. There are important contrasts between the retention model findings for all HBCUS and for UNCF institutions. These contrasts suggest that UNCF institutions have different dynamics than all HBCUs and retention level strategies that work for one might not work for the other. When regressed alone, the retention model for UNCF institutions revealed no significant results for the variables of interest. On the other hand, for all HBCUs, accreditation, selectivity and instructional staff percentage had consistent significant effects. Overall, institutional selectivity and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> appears to be an important determinant of graduation rates. Having an admissions policy (negative relationship) and accreditation recognized by the US Department of Education (positive relationship) significantly impacts 6 -year graduation rates. The open admissions policy is potentially a sensitive issue for HBCUs because of a tradition of providing educational access to disadvantaged populations. However, an increasingly competitive higher education arena, flanked with the possibility of state and federal aid tied to graduation outcomes, may necessitate a review of this policy and/or the institutional programs that support matriculating students entering under such a policy. Also, high expenditures in the institutional support category negatively impact graduation rates, suggesting that the current allocation of these overhead expenses deserves more scrutiny. The percentage of instructional staff has a significant influence on first year retention rates. In general, higher percentages of instructional staff negatively impacted retention rates. This finding is somewhat surprising as we might expect more staff dedicated to classroom instruction to {{have a positive effect on}} student outcomes. This finding warrants more research into the specific ways institutions assign instructional responsibilities to professors, especially those who teach first year students...|$|R

In some cases, most notably support provided in pursuit of environmental objectives, there may be a contradiction between the aims of support measures and the requirement that these should be minimally trade distorting.

To explain this variation, the constituencies for different policies under various conditions must be identified. This paper explores that question using Brazilian public opinion data on preferences regarding taxation, conditional cash transfers, pension schemes and educations.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is two-fold; first, it studies the impact of the {{credibility}} of fiscal rule policy on the stability of output growth; second, it compares the effectiveness of fiscal rule policy to discretionary and automatic stabilizer fiscal policies to address the fluctuation of output growth. Employing quarterly data over the period 2001 - 2013 in the case of Indonesia, we obtain that the credible debt rule leads to a decrease in the volatility of output growth while the non-credible deficit rule does not have any effect. Both unsystematic and systematic components of discretionary fiscal policy have a stabilizing function. Interestingly, the automatic stabilization tends to induce the volatility of output growth. Given those results, we infer that government spending is not a good automatic stabilizer. It seems that the lower ratio of government expenditure to GDP along with improving credibility of deficit rule policy has a smoother effect on the economy.
