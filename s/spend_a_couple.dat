2500|$|In 1900, Spargo {{participated in}} some of the {{preliminary}} meetings which brought together representatives of the SDF, the Independent Labour Party, the Fabian Society, and various trade unions and cooperative societies to form the Labour Parliamentary Representation Committee, a direct forerunner of the British Labour Party. This drive of the SDF to unite with various non-Marxist organizations brought about an immediate reaction from the party's hardline [...] "impossibilist" [...] left wing, who sought revolutionary transformation rather than incremental, piecemeal parliamentary reforms. The rise of the left caused Hyndman to temporarily leave the SDF's executive council and alienated Spargo to some extent from the party. Providentially, Spargo received at this time an invitation from the private lecture bureau to travel to America to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> months traveling the country, speaking about socialism. And so the newlyweds sailed for America and ultimately a new life there.|$|E

60|$|George Littlemore {{arrived in}} London on the twentieth of May, {{and one of}} the first things he did was to go and see Waterville at the Legation, where he {{mentioned}} that he had taken for the rest of the season a house at Queen Anne’s Gate, so that his sister and her husband, who, under the pressure of diminished rents, had let their own town residence, might come up and <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months with him.|$|E
60|$|The letter {{which was}} speedily {{on its way}} to Mr. Richard Lancaster was a very brief one. It simply asked the young gentleman to come to Broadstone, with bad news or good news, or without any news at all. It was {{absolutely}} necessary that the writer should see him, and in order that there might be no delay she sent a conveyance for him. Moreover, she added, it would give her great pleasure if Mr. Lancaster would come prepared to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days at her house. She felt sure good Captain Asher would spare him for that short time. She believed that at this moment more gentlemen were needed at Broadstone, and, although she did not go on to say that she thought Dick was not having a fair chance at this very important crisis, that is what she expected the young man to understand.|$|E
60|$|On the {{occasion}} when Captain Morville came to Redclyffe, and left James Thorndale to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of {{hours at the}} parsonage, they interrogated the latter anxiously on his acquaintance with Sir Guy. He had not the least idea of creating prejudice, indeed, he liked him as a companion, but he saw everything {{through the medium of}} his friend, and spoke something to this effect: He was very agreeable; they would like his manners; he was tolerably clever, but not to be named in the same day with his cousin for abilities, far less in appearance. Very pleasant, generally liked, decidedly a taking man; but there was some cloud over him just now--debts, probably. Morville had been obliged to go to Oxford about it; but Mr. Thorndale did not profess to understand it, as of course Morville said as little of it as he could. Thereupon all began to admire the aforesaid Morville, already known by report, and whose fine countenance and sensible conversation confirmed all that had been said of him.|$|E

60|$|He had {{but lately}} {{come out from}} England to manage the local branch of an English bank, and, {{reaching}} Samoa {{at the beginning of}} the dry season, he had taken a room at the hotel. He quickly made the acquaintance of all and sundry. The life of the island is pleasant and easy. He enjoyed the long idle talks in the lounge of the hotel and the gay evenings at the English Club when a group of fellows would play pool. He liked Apia straggling along the edge of the lagoon, with its stores and bungalows, and its native village. Then there were week-ends when he would ride over to the house of one planter or another and <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of nights on the hills. He had never before known freedom or leisure. And he was intoxicated by the sunshine. When he rode through the bush his head reeled a little at the beauty that surrounded him. The country was indescribably fertile. In parts the forest was still virgin, a tangle of strange trees, luxuriant undergrowth, and vine; it gave an impression that was mysterious and troubling.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Quiverful at {{once saw}} that her patroness was in a smiling humour. Triumph sat throned upon her brow, and all the joys of {{dominion}} hovered about her curls. Her lord had that morning contested with her a great point. He had received an invitation to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days with the archbishop. His soul longed for the gratification. Not a word, however, in his grace's note alluded to the fact of his being a married man; if he went at all, he must go alone. This necessity would have presented no insurmountable bar to the visit, or have militated much against the pleasure, had he {{been able to go}} without any reference to Mrs. Proudie. But this he could not do. He could not order his portmanteau to be packed and start with his own man, merely telling the lady of his heart that he would probably be back on Saturday. There are men--may we not rather say monsters?--who do such things, and there are wives--may we not rather say slaves?--who put up with such usage. But Dr. and Mrs. Proudie were not among the number.|$|E
60|$|He had not {{proceeded}} far when he {{came upon}} a colony of prairie-dogs. Upon this occasion he was little inclined to take a humorous view of the vagaries of these curious little creatures, but he shot one, and, as before, ate part of it raw. These creatures are so active that they are difficult to shoot, and even when killed generally fall into their holes and disappear. Crusoe, however, soon unearthed the dead animal on this occasion. That night the travellers came to a stream of fresh water, and Dick killed a turkey, so that he determined to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days there to recruit. At {{the end of that}} time he again set out, but was able only to advance five miles when he broke down. In fact, it became evident to him that he must have a longer period of absolute repose ere he could hope to continue his journey, but to do so without food was impossible. Fortunately there was plenty of water, as his course lay along the margin of a small stream, and, as the arid piece of prairie was now behind him, he hoped to fall in with birds, or perhaps deer, soon.|$|E
