5|$|The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative {{was set up}} in 2008 {{to collect}} data on climate change in the area. Students {{investigated}} the interaction between people and the moorlands, and their overall effect on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> source, {{based on the fact that}} upland areas of Britain are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat. Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered.|$|E
5|$|The damage inflicted {{during the}} attack was not {{sufficient}} to <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> disable Tirpitz, but she suffered considerable damage to her superstructure and unarmored areas, with 122 members of her crew killed and 316 were wounded. The German Kriegsmarine decided to repair the battleship, and works were completed by mid-July. The British conducted further carrier raids against Tirpitz between April and August 1944 {{in the hope of}} prolonging the period she was out of service, but none was successful. Tirpitz was eventually disabled and then sunk by Royal Air Force heavy bombers in late 1944.|$|E
5|$|The keel for U-38 {{was laid}} down on 15 April 1937 and after {{over a year}} and a half of {{construction}} she was commissioned on 24 October 1938 with Oberleutnant zur See Heinrich Liebe in command. Upon commissioning, U-38 was assigned to the 6th U-boat Flotilla. Like U-37, U-38 conducted eleven patrols. During these patrols she managed to <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> damage over 30 enemy vessels. Like U-37, U-38 ranks as one of the most successful U-boats of World War II, holding 10th place. With World War II drawing to a disastrous close for Germany, U-38 was scuttled by her own crew west of Wesermünde on 5 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} 15 September {{followed}} {{a series of}} raids conducted against Tirpitz by Royal Navy aircraft carriers between April and August 1944 that sought to <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> disable the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord in the far north of German-occupied Norway, so that she no longer posed a threat to Allied convoys travelling {{to and from the}} Soviet Union. While the first of these raids was successful, the other attacks failed due to shortcomings with the Fleet Air Arm's strike aircraft and the formidable German defences. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to the RAF's Bomber Command. Avro Lancaster bombers from the Command's two elite squadrons flew to their staging airfield in the Soviet Union on the night of 11/12 September, and attacked on 15 September using heavy bombs and air-dropped mines. All of the British aircraft returned to base, though one of the Lancasters later crashed during its flight back to the United Kingdom.|$|E

It appeared that he had undressed Kaede before murdering her, and then re-dressed her afterward.|$|E
25|$|The action, however, {{represented}} a failure on the Italians' part to exploit their advantage {{and destroy the}} convoy. Indeed, {{they were unable to}} <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> cripple a single cargo ship. This was due to Admiral Vian's vigorous and skillful defence {{in the face of a}} superior adversary. The overwhelming strength of the Italian fleet was not fully exploited by Admiral Iachino also because bad weather and lack of radar prevented him from continuing the pursuit of the convoy at dusk.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these raids, and needing to secure control of the lake to prevent German raids and to support their own troops in the field, the Admiralty despatched an expedition, led by Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, to transport two motor boats named HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou by sea, rail, river and road to the lake. Once there he was to <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> disable the German vessels, and secure control of the lake. After an arduous journey the two boats reached the lake and were launched on 22 and 23 December.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of St Mark's College {{was driven by}} the demand for student accommodation, which the University of Adelaide did not provide at the time.

It was thought that students should receive no tutorial assistance but rather <b>sink</b> <b>or</b> swim on a few lectures from their professors each week. The Reverend Julian Bickersteth led the drive to establish a residential college, with the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Adelaide appointing a committee to that end in September 1920.|$|E
