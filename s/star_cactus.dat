50|$|Like {{films of}} the classic Hollywood era, the erotic thriller has its female icons. The most famous among them is Shannon Tweed, the Playboy bunny turned actor, who starred in over fifteen erotic thrillers between 1985 and 2000, {{including}} Night Eyes 3 (1993), Indecent Behavior (1993), Scorned (1994), Illicit Dreams (1994), The Dark Dancer (1995), and Forbidden Sins (1999). Tweed married famous Kiss frontman Gene Simmons {{and went on to}} a successful career in reality television. Kathy Shower, also from the pages of Playboy magazine, <b>starred</b> in Wild <b>Cactus</b> (1993), L.A. Goddess (1993), and also Erotic Boundaries (1997), among other films and television shows. Fashion model Joan Severance, equal to Shannon Tweed in the number of erotic thriller films in which she starred, was the centerpiece of Write to Kill (1991), Lake Consequence (1993), Criminal Passion (1994), In Dark Places (1997), and many others. Danish fashion model and Parisian burlesque artist Delia Sheppard put an unmistakable mark on the genre by appearing in many films and starring in Mirror Images (1992). Jodie Fisher starred in Intimate Obsession (1992), Body of Influence 2 (1996), Sheer Passion (1998), and Dead by Dawn (1998). Tané McClure is a key player in many erotic thrillers, including Target for Seduction (1995), Sexual Impulse (1997), Scorned 2 (1997), and Illicit Dreams 2 (1998). Fiery redhead Angie Everhart was a supporting player in the big budget Jade (1995), then starred in Another Nine & a Half Weeks (1997), Sexual Predator (2001), Heart of Stone (2001), Bare Witness (2002), and Wicked Minds (2003). Julie Strain starred in Carnal Crimes (1991), Sorceress (1995), and Lethal Seduction (1997). Tanya Roberts, originally one of “Charlie’s Angels”, was in Night Eyes (1990) and Sins of Desire (1993). Rochelle Swanson entered the genre through the TV series Silk Stalkings, starring in Night Fire (1994), Secret Games 3 (1994), and Mutual Needs (1997), with appearances in Illicit Dreams (1994), Dead On (1994), Indecent Behavior II (1994), and Sorceress (1995). Shauna O'Brien is featured in Over the Wire (1996), Deadlock: A Passion for Murder (1997), Striking Resemblance (1997), and many other erotic thrillers and erotic dramas. Monique Parent is a veteran of the genre, appearing in many films, including Sins of Desire (1993), Body of Influence (1993), Sexual Outlaws (1993), and Midnight Confessions (1994), with starring roles in Vicious Kiss (1995), Love Me Twice (1996), and Dark Secrets (1997). Lee Anne Beaman was active in the genre throughout the 1990s, appearing in many films and starring in both The Other Woman (1992) and Irresistible Impulse (1996). Linda Fiorentino starred in Jade (1995), and also smaller films like The Last Seduction (1994) and Bodily Harm (1995). Finally, no list of female erotic thriller icons would be complete without Shannon Whirry, who starred in Animal Instincts (1992), Body of Influence (1993), Mirror Images 2 (1993), Lady in Waiting (1994), Animal Instincts 2 (1994), Private Obsession (1995), and Playback (1996).|$|R

40|$|Astrophytum asterias (<b>star</b> <b>cactus)</b> and Lophophora williamsii (peyote) are {{sympatric}} {{species in}} the Tamaulipecan thornscrub of South Texas and adjacent Mexico. Peyote has been excavated from two archaeological sites: Shumla Caves, Texas, and CM- 79 in Coahuila. We report new radiocarbon dates: a mean of 5195 ???? 20 14 C years BP for the Shumla Caves specimens, and 835 ???? 35 14 C years BP for the CM- 79 specimen. The Shumla Caves specimens were not intact peyote tops, but manufactured effigies thereof. Published data on the geographic ranges of L. williamsii and A. asterias are of varying quality and accuracy. We report the results of extensive research to document extant U. S. populations by county, drawing specific conclusions about where each species currently occurs, where its occurrence is uncertain {{and where it is}} unlikely, based on herbarium specimens, verifiable reports in the primary literature and interviews with knowledgeable individuals. Dwindling of populations of peyote is partly due to improper harvesting, namely cutting {{off the top of the}} plant so deeply below ground level that the plant is unable to regenerate new stems, and consequently dies. We describe the anatomy of the cactus shoot (stem) and root, and suggest how this new knowledge can be utilized to determine "how deep is too deep" to cut if harvesting of peyote is to be done sustainably. We report the first population genetics study on endangered A. asterias, with five microsatellite markers in populations sampled at four locations in South Texas. A battery of tests and measurements indicated that in most populations heterozygosity was high, F-statistics were low, and Nm was > 1. With one exception, these populations appear not to be undergoing excessive inbreeding, despite small population sizes. Data from two L. williamsii microsatellite loci are presented. L. williamsii, which reproduces autogamously, exhibits a single homozygous genotype within a given population. West Texas L. williamsii plants differ from South Texas plants in the identity of the single allele (or single genotype) at each locus. The ability of microsatellite markers to separate West Texas from South Texas plants suggests utility of microsatellites for infraspecific taxonomic studies in Lophophora...|$|E
