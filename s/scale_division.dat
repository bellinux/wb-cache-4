5000|$|With {{all this}} {{internal}} investment, Watson was, in essence, gambling on the future. It was IBM's first ‘Bet the Company’ gamble, but the risk paid off handsomely. Watson's factories, running full tilt {{for six years}} with no market to sell to, created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment, straining IBM's resources. To reduce the cash drain, the struggling Dayton <b>Scale</b> <b>Division</b> (the food services equipment business) was sold in 1933 to Hobart Manufacturing for stock. [...] When the Social Security Act of 1935 - labeled as [...] "the biggest accounting operation of all time" [...] - came up for bid, IBM was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment. Watson's gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. IBM's successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders, {{and by the end}} of the decade IBM had not only safely negotiated the Depression, but risen to the forefront of the industry. Watson's Depression-era decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities, education to expand the breadth of those capabilities, and his commitment to the data processing product line laid the foundation for 50 years of IBM growth and successes.|$|E

In England, a new institutional structure for {{local and regional}} development has recently emerged involving some decentralization of responsibility. A major focus has been stimulating and mediating inward investment. The new <b>scale</b> <b>division</b> of labour resembles somewhat that which has long been apparent in the USA. Similar tensions are observable, but there remain considerable differences and an examination of them facilitates understanding of the limits and possibilities inherent {{in the case of}} England. In the US case, institutions tend to be much more metropolitan in form, the public—private balance is quite different, and institutions tend to emerge locally rather than be structured from the centre.

40|$|The {{instrument}} {{to be described}} was developed for the measurement of bioelectric potentials, especially those found on the skin. As such it was desired that it be portable, not dependent {{on the availability of}} electric current, and that, because of its biological applications, the input resistance be at least 10 megohms and that grid current through this resistance be less than 1 0 - 10 amperes within the 100 millivolt range of the instrument. The sensitivity required was 1 millivolt per <b>scale</b> <b>division</b> of a portable galvanometer (sensitivity about 0. 040 microamperes per <b>scale</b> <b>division).</b> Other millivoltmeters 1 utilize large power type tubes, with high grid-to-plate transconductance, operated at reduced voltages to achieve stability and low grid current. These circuits have several disadvantages where portability is of importance: first, because of their large current requirements, a heavy-duty B battery for the plate circuit and a storage battery for the filaments become necessary; second, despite the use of these large batteries, the high current drain still causes enough instability so that a balanced bridge circuit is needed to eliminate 'battery variations; third, in achieving the requisite stability, the bridge doubles the current requirements while halving the sensitivity of the instrument as compared to that of a single tube. While less sensitive tubes (lower transconductance) designed for dry cell operation may be chosen, 2 they also must employ the balanced circuit with its attendant disadvantages. A new series of miniature tubest is well suited to portable battery powered apparatus. The filament draws less than 15 milliamperes from a single 1. 5 volt cell. The plate current of the triode VW- 32 is about 250 microamperes with a 10. 5 volt B battery. Because of these low current requirements, it was found that flashlight cells for the plate supplv and a single No. 6 type dry cell for the filamen...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to clarify the concept of {{locality}} or further research by investigating two common meanings of locality: locality as localised social structure and locality as agent. The first is developed through linking local dependence to territorial forms of the division of labour; to enable this a new concept, the <b>scale</b> <b>division</b> of labour, is introduced. This concept describes what roles in the social division or labour exist at different scales, and hence of what social relations the localised social structure consists. The locality as agent concept is developed from the idea of locally dependent actors with interests in the same locality forming an alliance, acting together to develop and implement strategies to further their interests. This avoids spatial fetishism because locality was first defined not in physical terms, but as localised social structure. ...|$|E
