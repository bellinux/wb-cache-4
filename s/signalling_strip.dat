40|$|ABSTRACT: When using {{transceivers}} (or avalanche beacons) {{to search}} for fully buried avalanche victims, the search strategy depends on the <b>signal</b> search <b>strip</b> width which influences the search time until the first signal from the buried subjects can be received by the rescuer. It depends on technical characteristics of the avalanche rescue devices, the avalanche scenario {{as well as the}} rescuer’s behaviour. The larger the <b>signal</b> search <b>strip</b> width, the shorter is the search time and therefore the higher the survival chance of the buried subject. However, if the search strip width is chosen too large, the probability to miss a buried subject increases, which makes time-consuming multiple searches necessary – and decreases survival chances. Therefore, the search strip width needs to optimized. Only a few years ago, with the advent of digital transceivers, it was realized that the search strip width is not a universal constant but is a device specific property depending primarily on the range of the transceiver. Several approaches on how to determine the <b>signal</b> search <b>strip</b> width have been presented in the past. Most of them use rather conservative assumptions for the different input variables. A newly developed simulation approach for the optimization of the search strip width allows considering more realistic (rather than worst case) assumptions. Preliminary results suggest that the optimal <b>signal</b> search <b>strip</b> width is higher than previously assumed. In future applications, the simulation may be used to optimize a broad variety of search parameters or even entire search systems...|$|R

In both cases, the CMTLs are considered with different number of unit cells.

Numerical and experimental results illustrate that the zeroth-order resonance frequencies of the ENG and DNG monopoles are in desirable consistency.

40|$|Abstract—The etching error causes serious {{frequency}} drift of a microstrip stepped-impedance resonator (SIR). This paper proposes a novel microstrip quarter-wave SIR structure, which is insensitive to fabrication tolerances. Inserting several ground strips in the low-impedance {{section of the}} resonator keeps the impedance ratio almost constant in spite of inaccurate fabrication. As an additional benefit, the resonator size would be miniaturized because the characteristic impedance of the microstrip line in the low-impedance section is mainly controlled by the <b>signal</b> <b>strips</b> and the inserted ground strips in a coplanar manner. The concepts and characteristics of this modified resonator structure are discussed in detail. The filters constructed by the conventional microstrip SIR were also designed and fabricated at the same frequency band to compare with the proposed ones.

Backprojection of teleseismic waves is commonly used to image the rupture process of large events.

We present an iterative backprojection method with subevent <b>signal</b> <b>stripping</b> to determine the distribution of subevents (large energy bursts) during the earthquake rupture.

This thesis analyses and develops methods for improving {{signal to noise ratio}} for electrical methodsThe ability to recover subsurface information from electrical exploration methods is dependent on the limits of signal detection which is strongly influenced by instrumentation and the conductivity structure of the Earth. Multiple sensors can be used to collect data efficiently over a survey area. Such multi-receiver arrays can improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the use of multiple sensors can also be exploited to improve the signal fidelity from each sensor, which may then translate to more accurate geological models and/or greater depth of investigation. In this thesis a two step algorithm for the removal of harmonic noise and atmospheric transients is presented. The first step is the removal of harmonic noise from each sensor using a non-linear single value decomposition (SVD) inversion technique to model a modulated sinusoid to narrow band noise sources. The second step is spherics attenuation using an iterative technique of <b>signal</b> <b>stripping</b> then removing residual coherent noise across the array combined with robust statistical measures in the tacking process.
