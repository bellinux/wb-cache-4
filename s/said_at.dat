He <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established.

5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the time that he had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E

5|$|Muin-i Zafer {{was reduced}} to a {{stationary}} ship in İzmir in 1910, at which point her armament {{was reduced to}} just two of the 75mm guns and four 57mm guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. At the start of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed as a guard ship in Beirut. She left shortly after the onset of hostilities, however, and on 30 September arrived in Port <b>Said</b> <b>at</b> the northern end of the Suez Canal. There, she was disarmed and her guns were taken ashore to strengthen the local defenses. By the start of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Muin-i Zafer had been moved back to İzmir. In 1913, she became a torpedo training ship based in Constantinople. The ship was converted into a floating barracks in 1920 stationed in İzmit. In 1928, the vessel was converted again, into a depot ship for submarines at Erdek. She served in that capacity for four years before being decommissioned in 1932; she was broken up for scrap in 1934.|$|E

He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had {{cleared the way for}} the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he <b>said</b> <b>at</b> the start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee.
