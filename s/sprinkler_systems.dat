5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|When One Meridian Plaza {{was built}} Philadelphia was {{enforcing}} a building code from 1949 that made {{no distinction between}} high-rises and other buildings. In 1984 Philadelphia adopted new codes that required automatic <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> in all new buildings. At the time of construction, sprinklers were only built on the service levels below ground. In 1988 plans {{were put in place}} to have automatic sprinklers placed throughout the building by November 1993. By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and in part on three other floors. The sprinklers had been installed during floor renovations at the request of tenants and the building's owners had plans to install more as other floors were renovated.|$|E
40|$|Several {{criteria}} {{should be}} evaluated before designing a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> into a Performance-based design (PBD) {{to make it more}} effective in case of fire situations. A <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> serves the detection and suppression functions and contains a thermal sensing element that operates at a predetermined temperatures. The effectiveness of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> depends on fire size at the time the sprinkler is activated, the characteristics of the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> the geometry of the protected space, {{and the extent to which}} the fuel the fuel is shielded.

5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

25|$|While {{there was}} much {{criticism}} {{of the lack of}} fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems,</b> Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the Architects' Journal, wrote on 14 June 2017 that if a gas riser was leaking or the cladding was at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He also said that reports of combustible material stored in the common walkways suggested poor overall management. David Siber, an advisor to the Fire Brigades Union, said sprinklers would have prevented the fire, if it started in a kitchen, from ever spreading beyond that room.|$|E
25|$|The Tōkaidō Shinkansen often {{experiences}} {{heavy snow}} {{in the area around}} Maibara Station in winter.

Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the Jōetsu Shinkansen, winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and slab track, to mitigate the effects of deep snow.|$|E
