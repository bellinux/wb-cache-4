40|$|The {{environmental}} seals for {{the main}} landing gear doors of the Shuttle Orbiters were raised by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board as a potential safety concern. Inspections of <b>seals</b> <b>installed</b> on the Shuttle Discovery revealed that they were permanently deformed and no longer met certified seal compression requirements. Replacement of the seals led to the inability to fully close the main landing gear doors. Johnson Space Center requested that Glenn Research Center conduct tests on the main landing gear door environmental seals to assist in <b>installing</b> the <b>seals</b> in a manner to allow the main landing gear doors to fully close. Further testing was conducted {{to fill out the}} seal performance database. Results from the testing indicated that the method of bonding the seals was important in reducing seal loads on the main landing gear doors. Also, the replacement <b>seals</b> <b>installed</b> in Shuttle Discovery were found to have leakage performance sufficient to meet the certification requirements...|$|R

Non-metallic brush seal can be successfully used where the local temperatures and pressures allow their safe usage. Compressor bearing number one is close to its suction where the air temperatures are low enough to enable the usage of non-metallic bristles which in turn are the core of the brush seals...|$|R

The sealing performance of the MF <b>seal</b> <b>installed</b> in a rotary blood pump was studied. The seal was perfect against a pressure of 150 mmHg in a continuous flow of 4. 0 L/min for 275 days and against a pressure of 175 mmHg in a continuous flow of 3. 9 L/min for 217 days. We have developed a MF seal that works in liquid against pressure mostly used clinically. The magnetic fluid seal is promising as a shaft seal for rotary blood pumps...|$|R

Based on the configuration design of <b>seal</b> <b>installed</b> to the front part in the automotive engine, this study carried out interpretations on the stress and reaction for those two types of oil seals to compare the maximum stress and contact load generated from the seal steel, rubber and PTFE lip. This study also verified the stress concentration and anti-wear performance through the coefficient of friction, torque and durability test by producing two types of PTFE seals actually.

40|$|Special Paperpg. 117 Thermally induced {{failures}} {{have long}} since plagued mechanical seal users. Over the years these failures {{have led to the}} development of different flush plan and seal design features that are used to increase heat transfer from the seal interface. In this paper the first experimental results for a new mechanical seal design operating in a pump are presented. In this design a heat sink, consisting of thousands of micron size cooling pins, is constructed on the end face of the stationary seal ring just below the sealing interface. Since the entire heat sink is constructed within millimeters of the interface, there is an extremely small thermal resistance between the interface and the coolant. Two prototype experiments are carried out; one for dry running conditions at pressure velocity values of 14. 0 MPa m/s (400, 000 psi*ft/min) and the other with the <b>seal</b> <b>installed</b> in a small ANSI water pump operating under dead head conditions.

At the 1934 California State Fair, Los Angeles-based Helms Bakery won the gold medal for the best loaf of bread, topping 471 other entries. [...] Large reproductions of this medal, showing the seal on one side, can be seen on the exterior of all three former locations in Culver City, Montebello, and San Bernardino. As part of his 1932 mural on the ceiling of the Fluor Gallery of the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, artist Martin Syvertsen included a seal.
