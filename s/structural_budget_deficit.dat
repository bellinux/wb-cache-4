As a <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> continued, the government kept borrowing more, creditors continued to lend money, while the IMF suggested less state spending {{to stop the}} government's ongoing need to keep borrowing more and more. As the debt pile grew, it became increasingly clear the government's <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> was not compatible with a low inflation fixed exchange rate - either the government had to start earning {{as much as it}} spent, or it had to start (inflationary) printing of money (and thus abandoning the fixed exchange rate as it {{would not be able to}} borrow the needed amounts of US dollars to keep the exchange rate stable). Investors started to speculate that the government would never stop spending more than it earned, and so there was only one option for the government - inflation and the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate. In a similar fashion to Black Wednesday, investors began to sell the Argentine currency, betting it would become worthless against the US dollar when the inevitable inflation started. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy, quickly leading to the government's US dollar reserves being exhausted. The crisis led to riots in December 2001. In 2002, a default on about $93 billion of the debt was declared. Investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely.|$|E

40|$|Summary Neither {{the current}} Labour {{government}} nor the previous Conservative one {{can look back}} over their respective terms of office as periods of great success in fiscal management. Both started by strengthening their underlying budget balances for three years after taking office, but both then allowed them to drift steadily back into the red. This meant that they were already borrowing significant amounts when the onset of recession required them to borrow more. Labour is entering this recession with a similar <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> {{to the one that}} it inherited from the Conservatives, but with a smaller underlying debt. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> will deteriorate as far under Labour as it did under the Conservatives, but debt is very likely to rise above the peak it recorded under the Conservatives (even without the impact of recent bank nationalisations and recapitalisations). Labour recorded a similar <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> in the year before this recession to that which the Conservatives recorded in the year before the last. However, the structural deficit appears to have deteriorated more sharply in the early phase of the downturn than it did under the Conservatives and as a result is set to be higher in the first year of recession than it was under the Conservatives. This largely reflects the particular impact of the credit crunch and falls in the stock market and housing market, rather than budget decisions. Labour is also going into the recession with a significantly higher level of debt than the Conservatives did. Turning to the international context, we are entering the current recession with one of the largest structural budget deficits in the industrial world and a debt level that may be among the smallest in the G 7 but which is larger than that of most industrial countries. We have done less to reduce our <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and less to reduce our debt than most other industrial countries since Labour came to office. ...|$|E

The analysis reveals a unidirectional causal relation running from <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to net exports, confirming some of Miller and Russek's findings.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two-way {{interactions between}} structural reform and macro policy. If structural reforms increase {{the flexibility of}} labor markets, {{they are likely to}} improve the short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff, providing an incentive for policymakers to expand aggregate demand. Also, policymakers' promises that they will encourage a decline in unemployment in response to good news on inflation can be used to strike a political deal with interests opposed to the introduction or extension of structural reform. Expansionary monetary policy also gives relief on the fiscal front by bringing the actual budget deficit closer to the <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> and indirectly, by encouraging structural reform, potentially reducing the <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> itself. In 1992 - 93 several European countries dropped out of the ERM to pursue more expansionary monetary policies. The difference in the results of these countries and those countries which maintained a peg between their currencies and the Deutschemark provides a test case of the consequences of expansionary monetary policy. The depreciating nations by 1995 enjoyed a relative acceleration of nominal GDP and an even greater deceleration of inflation, so that their growth rate of real GDP accelerated more than their growth rate of nominal GDP in relation to the pegging countries. The continued deceleration of inflation in the depreciating countries provides evidence that their natural unemployment rate has declined and that expansionary monetary policy has interacted beneficially with structural reform. ...|$|E
