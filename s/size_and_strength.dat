5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

5|$|His father, disapproving of Darling's {{fondness for}} sport, sent {{him away from}} his cricket and Australian rules {{football}} teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to an already stocky and athletic frame.

5|$|As Gert {{was several}} {{days away from}} Bermuda, the NHC advised {{residents}} there to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm, Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September19, about two days prior to its closest approach. As Gert moved closer to the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September20, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away. Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them to emergency shelters. Police workers advised 700families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships away, while hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where its <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E

The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E
5|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, {{they noticed}} Union cavalry under Brig. Gen.

When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth {{what he had}} seen, neither general believed {{that there was a}} substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> of the enemy force in his front.

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength,</b> it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} as a man of immense <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the American Civil War, the Wirgman Building was {{frequently}} {{used as a}} military prison by both Confederate States Army and Union Army forces during their occupations of Romney. In the Spring of 1862, a spy for the command of Stonewall Jackson, Lieutenant John Blue, was captured by Union Army soldiers while he was conducting a reconnaissance mission to determine the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> of the Union Army forces occupying Romney. Pending his transfer to a military prison in Wheeling where {{he was to be}} tried as a suspected spy, Blue was imprisoned in a room {{on the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building. During the early morning on Easter Day, Blue disabled the only guard on duty, disguised himself in a Union Army coat and headgear and proceeded to barricade the remainder of the prison garrison within the Wirgman Building. Blue walked to the periphery of the town of Romney unnoticed by the occupying Union Army forces, and successfully made it to safety.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime: Samus {{receives}} a distress signal {{in her new}} ship and travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. She discovers that the Chozo once settled on this planet, and their disappearance, {{as well as the}} emergence of Phazon, is due to a meteor impacting the planet decades ago. After ruining a Space Pirate mining operation and collecting the twelve Chozo Artifacts that allow access to the sealed impact crater, she confronts and defeats Ridley before delving deeper into the impact site and discovering Metroid Prime, a matured Metroid, mutated and corrupted by Phazon. Metroid Prime had been feeding off the Phazon Core of the meteor to increase in <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength.</b> During the final battle against Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime grabs and takes Samus's Phazon Suit from her. She flees the impact site and after the credits, there is a glimpse of a dark hand coming out of a pool of Phazon in the arena where Samus and Metroid Prime fought. It is implied that this hand is Dark Samus in the future games and that Metroid Prime by taking Samus's suit becomes Dark Samus. It was released on the GameCube and is the first of the Metroid Prime Trilogy.|$|E
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match was}} next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the {{advantage}} {{by focusing on}} injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post {{with a piece of}} tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the Jackknife power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the Sharpshooter submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could not control the match, it was declared a draw and Diesel retained his championship.|$|E

5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
