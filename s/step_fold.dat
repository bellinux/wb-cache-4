40|$|Fold recognition, {{assigning}} novel proteins to known structures, {{forms an}} important component of the overall protein structure discovery process. The available methods for protein fold recognition are limited by the low fold-coverage and/or low prediction accuracies. We describe here a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) -based method for protein fold prediction with high prediction accuracy and high fold-coverage. The new method of fold prediction with high fold-coverage was developed by training and testing on a large number of folds in order to make the method suitable for large scale fold predictions. However, presence of large number of folds in the training set made the classification task difficult as a consequence of increased complexity involved in binary classifications of SVMs. In order to overcome this complexity we adopted a hierarchical approach where fold-prediction is made in two steps. At the first step structural class of the query is predicted and at the second <b>step</b> <b>fold</b> is predicted within the predicted structural class. This decreased the complexity of the classification problem and also improved the overall fold prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first taxonomic fold recognition method to cover over 700 protein-folds and gives prediction accuracy of around 70 % on a benchmark dataset. Since the new method gives rise to state of the art prediction performance and hence can be very useful for structural characterization of proteins discovered in various genomes...|$|E

The folding rate approaches the diffusion-limited value and is much faster than possible if folding is contingent on precollision helix formation. Therefore, the collision of two unstructured chains is the initial step of the dominant kinetic pathway, whereas helicity exerts its influence only at a later <b>step.</b> <b>Folding</b> from an unstructured encounter complex may be efficient and robust, which has implications for any biological process that couples folding to binding...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in RNA folding {{is the nature}} of the rate-limiting <b>step.</b> <b>Folding</b> of large RNAs often is trapped by the need to undo misfolded structures, which precludes the study of the other, potentially more interesting aspects in the rate-limiting step, such as conformational search, metal ion binding, and the role of productive intermediates. The catalytic domain of the Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA folds without a kinetic trap, thereby providing an ideal system to elucidate these steps. We analyzed the folding kinetics by using fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopies, catalytic activity, and synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering. Folding begins with the rapid formation of early intermediates wherein the majority of conformational search occurs, followed by the slower formation of subsequent intermediates. Before the rate-limiting step, more than 98 % of the total structure has formed. The rate-limiting step is a small-scale structural rearrangement involving prebound metal ions...|$|R

40|$|The {{articulation}} {{process of}} dynamical networks is studied with a functional map, a minimal {{model for the}} dynamic change of relationships through iteration. The model is a dynamical system of a function f, not of variables, having a self-reference f, introduced by recalling that operation in a biological system is often applied to itself, as is typically seen in rules in the natural language or genes. Starting from an inarticulate network, two types of fixed points are formed as an invariant structure with iterations. The function is folded with time, until it has finite or infinite piecewise-flat segments of fixed points, regarded as articulation. For an initial logistic map, attracted functions are classified into <b>step,</b> <b>folded</b> <b>step,</b> fractal, and random phases, according {{to the degree of}} folding.

40|$|Antibody folding is {{a complex}} process {{comprising}} folding and association reactions. Although it is usually difficult to characterize kinetic folding intermediates, {{in the case of}} the antibody Fab fragment, domain-domain interactions lead to a rate-limiting <b>step</b> of <b>folding,</b> thus accumulating folding intermediates at a late <b>step</b> of <b>folding.</b> Here, we analyzed a late folding intermediate of the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody MAK 33 from mouse (kappa/IgG 1). As a strategy for accumulation of this intermediate we used partial denaturation of the native Fab by guanidinium chloride. This denaturation intermediate, which can be populated to about 90 %, is indistinguishable from a late-folding intermediate with respect to denaturation and renaturation kinetics. The spectroscopic analysis reveals a native-like secondary structure of this intermediate with aromatic side chains only slightly more solvent exposed than in the native state. The respective partner domains are weekly associated. From these data we conclude that the intramolecular association of the two chains during folding, with all domains in a native-like structure, follows a two-step mechanism. In this mechanism, presumably hydrophobic interactions are followed by rearrangements leading to the exact complementarity of the contact sites of the respective domains...|$|R

40|$|A {{structural}} map of Oscar I 1 Land compiled using {{black and}} white, stereo-pair air photos and other available information sources suggests {{the existence of}} three structural zones within the deformed platform cover strata. The western zone consists of basement involved overthrusts of complex geometry {{in the north and}} large-scale folds of platform cover strata with a stepped, down to the east profile in the south. The central zone consists primarily of folds within Kapp Starostin Fm. and overlying Triassic strata that likely formed above a subhorizontal dkcollement within Gipshuken Fm. strata. Farther to the east thrusts cmplace Permian Kapp Starostin Fm. strata over Triassic strata. This zone probably represents stratigraphic climb of the basal decollement. Conservative estimates of shortening for the central and eastern zones are in the 15 - 25 % range. The contribution of the western zone structures to overall Tertiary shortening depends on the geometry of faults underlying the <b>stepped</b> <b>folds</b> and is uncertain at present. Changes along strike are in part due to differential levels of erosion and changes in transport direction, but also probably important was variable thickness of the platform cover strata involved (less to the north) and the availability of incompetent horizons along which thrust-flats could form.

The same kinetics of renaturation are obtained for the dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 3) and the kinase activity (EC 2. 7. 2. 4).

In this case also, the refolding depends on the formation of dimeric species. However, the refolding of this fragment is much faster than that of the dehydrogenase region in the intact enzyme.

40|$|A {{striking}} and widespread observation is that higher-order folding for many RNAs is very slow, often requiring minutes.
