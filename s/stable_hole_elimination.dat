40|$|BACKGROUND: Large interfragmentary {{movements}} may delay bone-healing. The {{hypothesis of}} the present study was that a reduction of interfragmentary movements, especially of torsional rotation and bending angles, would support the healing process and lead to improved healing following unreamed tibial nailing. The objective of this study was to investigate healing of an unstable tibial osteotomy site following stabilization with unreamed nailing with a modified tibial device that had angle <b>stable</b> <b>holes</b> for the locking bolts. We compared those findings with healing after stabilization of such sites with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The duration of the study period was nine weeks. METHODS: The site of a standardized displaced osteotomy (3 -mm gap) in twelve ovine tibiae was stabilized with unreamed tibial nailing: six animals were treated with a modified nail that had angle <b>stable</b> <b>holes</b> for the locking bolts, and six were treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. In vivo gait analysis with optical measurements of interfragmentary movements and simultaneous measurements of ground reaction parameters were performed three days after the operation and once weekly afterward. After the animals were killed at nine weeks, the treated and contralateral tibiae were explanted, the implants were removed, and radiographs were made and evaluated for bridged cortices. Each pair of tibiae was also mechanically tested until torsional failure, after which the whole callus region was subjected to histological and histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Throughout the examination period, the interfragmentary movements in all directions were significantly smaller in the group treated with the angle stable tibial nail than they were in the group treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The limbs treated with the angle stable tibial nails returned to almost full weight-bearing during the period of the investigation, whereas those treated with standard nailing did not. Histomorphometric analysis, radiographic data, and mechanical testing showed superior bone-healing following treatment with the angle stable tibial nail. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an angle stable tibial nail may help to reduce interfragmentary movements in vivo and thus lead to superior bone-healing compared with that following standard unreamed tibial nailing...|$|R

The holes became larger with increasing talin concentration, and finally the cup-shaped liposomes were transformed into lipid bilayer sheets. These morphological changes were reversed by protein dilution, i. e., the sheets could be transformed back into closed spherical liposomes. We demonstrated that talin was localized mainly along the membrane verges, presumably avoiding exposure of its hydrophobic portion {{at the edge of}} the lipid bilayer. This is the first demonstration that a lipid bilayer can stably maintain a free verge in aqueous solution. This finding refutes the established dogma that all lipid bilayer membranes inevitably form closed vesicles and suggests that talin is a useful tool for manipulating liposomes...|$|R

Although the ellipticity of the underlying inviscid conservation law creates an instability of the linearized transport equation at every single point of the degenerate shock wave, which moreover is absolute in a region near the shock location, holes and accompanying overcompressive shocks turn out to be asymptotically stable.

Abstract. { We discuss {{the properties of}} fluid membranes, whose fluctuations are restricted {{due to lack of}} area.

The relevance of these results for recent observations on systems of vesicles is briefly discussed. Self-assembled lipid bilayers, such as those forming vesicles, lamellar phases and biological membranes, often experience an eectively vanishing surface tension.

40|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of polymer thin films has been a subject of controversy {{in the last two}} decades. Determinations of the thermal Tg, that is the temperature at which a discontinuity in thermodynamic coefficients is observed, generally suggest a significant depression, whereas the molecular mobility is found to be unchanged. These experimental evidences have been recently rationalized within the volume holes diffusion model. Such model was previously applied to the description of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in different nanostructured systems, included polymer freestanding films. According to the model, Tg depression emerges from the ability of thinner films to maintain equilibrium, due to the shorter distance free volume holes have to diffuse to the polymer interface, the molecular motion determining the diffusion coefficient being thickness independent. The present study aims to extend the application of the model to supported films that is systems where adsorption at the polymer/substrate interface limits the amount of >free> interface available to free volume <b>holes</b> <b>elimination.</b> Our analysis demonstrates that the model is able to quantitatively capture the thickness as well as the cooling rate dependence of the Tg depression in a variety of sample configurations. © 2013 Elsevier B.
