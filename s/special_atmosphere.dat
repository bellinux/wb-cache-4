In melting operations the [...] "phase rule" [...] applies to all pure and combined elements and strictly dictates the distribution of liquid and solid phases which can exist for specific compositions. In addition, whole body melting of starting materials is required for alloying, thus imposing unwelcome chemical, thermal, and containment constraints on manufacturing.

500|$|In the mid-1930s, {{representatives from}} Lancashire County Cricket Club twice {{approached}} Constantine {{with a view}} to him joining the club—his time in Nelson meant that he qualified to play for Lancashire, having lived in the county for the required time. There was a precedent for such a course, as the Australian Ted McDonald had joined Lancashire after playing as Nelson's professional in the 1920s. In the case of Constantine nothing happened, as members of the Lancashire Board and, later, players in the team opposed the idea of a black man playing for the county. In any case Constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was the negativity and dullness of county cricket. He found the standard of play very high, stating: [...] "Never in my life have I played harder than in Lancashire." [...] In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting, but: [...] "it was in this <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of League cricket that Constantine was supreme." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{adopting}} the plein-air approach, the painters {{were able to}} create their works in the open, immediately capturing the special effects of light and colour on their subjects. Fishermen were considered an especially interesting group in view of their dangerous work and their heroic behaviour. Lars Kruse, depicted by Michael Ancher, was famous for his success in rescuing a number of sailors who would otherwise have drowned. P.S. Krøyer's works were less dramatic, depicting fishermen pulling their nets in after a day at sea. While some of the paintings portrayed authentic occurrences, the artists often paid the fishermen to act as models, supplementing their modest incomes. Krøyer's works also included scenes of walks on the beach, romantic evenings in the moonlight and portraits of his wife Marie. As time went by, Krøyer increasingly painted [...] "moods", works which depicted the <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the [...] "Blue Hour" [...] which developed in the evening as the sky merged with the sea. In addition to his landscapes and family portraits, Laurits Tuxen is remembered for painting the flowers in his garden. Anna Ancher's paintings, on the other hand, focused on interiors of the home, including women and children, in a more abstract style.|$|E

50|$|After the pre-bonding in air, in a <b>special</b> gaseous <b>atmosphere</b> or vacuum, the wafers {{have to pass}} an {{annealing}} process for increasing the bonding strength. The annealing therefore provides {{a certain amount of}} thermal energy which forces more silanol groups to react among each other and new, highly stable chemical bindings are formed. The kind of binding which forms directly depends on the amount of energy which has been delivered or the applied temperature respectively. In consequence the bonding strength rises with increasing annealing temperatures.|$|R
40|$|About {{five years}} ago {{development}} work began on a new concept for processing metal powders at high temperature under various <b>special</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> The process was called mechanical fluidization. The machine which performs the process {{is known as a}} Mechanical Fluidized Vacuum (MFV) machine because it is possible to fluidize material in a vacuum, something that heretofore was impossible. In an MFV machine, a horizontally disposed retort is two-thirds filled with material and rotated at a speed that keeps the material in a fluffed up or fluidized state. It`s turning a lot faster than a kiln, but not fast enough to cause the material to centrifuge outward and stick to the walls. In this mechanically fluidized state it was discovered that the thermal transfer rate between powders and amongst parts immersed in those powders is extremely fast, faster even than a gas fluidized bed despite the total lack of gas in the retort. Figure 1 compares the heat transfer rate in air, in a vibratory bed, in a gas fluidized bed and a rotary fluidized bed. As shown, the rotary fluidized bed heat transfer is much faster than all the others. Fluidization is entirely mechanical so no gas at all is required for fluidization; only the gas required for processing need be directed to the retort. It is possible to fluidize material in a vacuum - a feat heretofore impossible...|$|R
2500|$|Trinity {{is one of}} the few {{colleges that}} {{continues}} the tradition of Formal Hall during the academic year; High Table dinners are usually held after Evensong on Wednesdays. Before the meal, one of the Student Heads or another positioned member of college (in order of precedence determined by seniority) is responsible for saying the Latin grace: Quae hodie sumpturi sumus, benedicat Deus, per Iesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. Amen. (May God bless what we are about to receive this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.) Formal Hall is marked by the enforcement of a number of regulations known as “Strachan Hall Etiquette”. The most evident of these is the dress code, of which Trinity’s distinctive academic gowns are the essential element for all members of college. In addition to the wearing of the gown, men are required to wear a jacket, collared shirt, long pants and a tie, as well as close-toed shoes. If a man of college has had the honour of being [...] "poored out", he is then permitted to wear his tie tied on the remains of his gown. For women of college, the dress code consists of a similar prohibition on open-toed shoes as well as a prohibition on short skirts and track pants. Although the dress code may look like an unnecessary burden to the casual observer, many students feel that it and other formalities lend a <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to the dinners that is not found in the rest of the university.|$|E
60|$|There was a muttered {{response}} {{from either side}} of him,--none from the august figure in the opposite corner. Jacob fingered with tentative wistfulness the very choice rose which he was wearing in his buttonhole. Perhaps he ought not to have plucked and worn it. Perhaps it ought not to have opened its soft, sweet petals for an owner who was dwelling in the Valley of Impecunious Disgrace. Perhaps {{he ought to have}} ended there and then the good-natured rivalry of years and offered the cherished blossom to his silent creditor in the corner, in place of the very inferior specimen which adorned the lapel of the great man's coat. Even in that moment of humiliation, Jacob felt a little thrill of triumph at the thought of Mr. Bultiwell's three gardeners. It took more than gardeners to grow such a rose as he was wearing. He liked to fancy that it took personal care, personal sympathy, personal love. The sweetest and rarest flowers must have their <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E

If there was one thing of which she was {{absolutely}} incapable, it was stealthiness, Her sincerity was expressed in the very rhythm of her walk. It was I who was looking at her covertly--if I may say so. I knew where she had been, but I did not know what she had seen and heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies. I use the word aristocratic, {{for want of a better}} term. The Chateau Borel, embowered in the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds, had its fame in our day, like the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman, Madame de Stael, in the Napoleonic era. Only the Napoleonic despotism, the booted heir of the Revolution, which counted that intellectual woman for an enemy worthy to be watched, was something quite unlike the autocracy in mystic vestments, engendered by the slavery of a Tartar conquest. And Madame de S-- was very far from resembling the gifted author of Corinne. She made a great noise about being persecuted. I don't know if she were regarded in certain circles as dangerous. As to being watched, I imagine that the Chateau Borel could be subjected only to a most distant observation. It was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for hatching superior plots--whether serious or futile. But all this did not interest me. I wanted to know the effect its extraordinary inhabitants and its <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere</b> had produced on a girl like Miss Haldin, so true, so honest, but so dangerously inexperienced! Her unconsciously lofty ignorance of the baser instincts of mankind left her disarmed before her own impulses. And there was also that friend of her brother, the significant new arrival from Russia.... I wondered whether she had managed to meet him.|$|E

5000|$|Over the years, Karl Hurm withdrew {{more and}} more from portraying real life. With many layers of paint applied with fine brushes, he created a {{parallel}} universe with shapes disconnected from reality, using emotional effects of colours to create <b>special</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> With unrestrained imagination Hurm distanced moments of everyday life, set new emphases with idiosyncratic rules. Thus, in Viadukt in der Winterlandschaft (1988, transl.: Viaduct in winter landscape) small, stocky men seem to be hiding from tall, voluptuous, red-haired women, or, in Gelber Hügel (1998, transl.: Yellow hill), a man is depicted as a lonely beholder of nature. Houses are arranged in a pile to form a mountain (Turm in der Winterlandschaft, 1986, transl.: Tower in winter landscape), birds take on the colours and outlines of bushes (Großer Vogel mit drei Bäumen, 1986, transl.: Big bird with three trees). Winter landscapes and interiors gave Hurm the opportunity to explore [...] "unconventional dominances of colours" [...] (Blumenstrauß mit gelbem Vorhang, 1989, transl.: bouquet of flowers with yellow curtain). Hurm also experimented with the colours red, white, blue, and brown, and placed them as colour filters over his motifs (Blauer Stadtteil, 1988, transl.: Blue suburb). In the 1990s, Hurm's colours developed a life of [...] "delimitation". [...] were detached from their subjects. Colours enveloped groups (Grüne Vögel bei den Kühen, 1999, transl.: green birds with cows) set expressive, high-contrast emphases. Hurm transitioned to abstraction reminiscent of cave paintings. (Tierherde im Winter, 2000, transl.: herd of cattle/animals in winter).|$|R

6000|$|About {{five o'clock}} {{of that same}} afternoon, Gerald Malloring went to see Tod. An open-air man himself, who often deplored the long hours he was {{compelled}} to spend in the <b>special</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the House of Commons, he rather envied Tod his existence in this cottage, crazed from age, and clothed with wistaria, rambler roses, sweetbrier, honeysuckle, and Virginia creeper. Freeland had, in his opinion, quite a jolly life of it--the poor fellow not being able, of course, to help having a cranky wife and children like that. He pondered, as he went along, over a talk at Becket, when Stanley, still {{under the influence of}} Felix's outburst, had uttered some rather queer sayings. For instance, he had supposed that they (meaning, apparently, himself and Malloring) WERE rather unable to put themselves in the position of these Trysts and Gaunts. He seemed to speak of them as one might speak generically of Hodge, which had struck Malloring as singular, it not being his habit to see anything in common between an individual case, especially on his own estate, and the ethics of a general proposition. The place for general propositions was undoubtedly the House of Commons, where they could be supported one way or the other, out of blue books. He had little use for them in private life, where innumerable things such as human nature and all that came into play. He had stared rather hard at his host when Stanley had followed up that first remark with: [...] "I'm bound to say, I shouldn't care to have to get up at half past five, and go out without a bath!" [...] What {{that had to do with}} the land problem or the regulation of village morality Malloring had been unable to perceive. It all depended on what one was accustomed to; and in any case threw no light on the question, as to whether or not he was to tolerate on his estate conduct of which his wife and himself distinctly disapproved. At the back of national life there was always this problem of individual conduct, especially sexual conduct--without regularity in which, the family, as the unit of national life, was gravely threatened, to put it on the lowest ground. And he did not see how to bring it home to the villagers that they had got to be regular, without making examples now and then.|$|E

30|$|Organic-inorganic {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} (PSCs) {{have become a}} pacemaker in the photovoltaic community with a rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from initial 3.8 % in 2009 to a recently reported 22.7 % [1 – 3], due to the high absorption coefficient, low exciton-binding energy, long charge carrier diffusion length, and high mobility of the organic-inorganic perovskite materials [4 – 12]. Unfortunately, the organic-inorganic perovskite materials {{are very sensitive to}} moisture due to the hygroscopic nature of the organic components [13], so the fabrication and long-term stability of PSCs in ambient air has been considered as one of the major challenges for future large-scale application. Interface engineering and encapsulation technology are widely used to improve the stability of PSCs in ambient air, which gains obvious effect [14, 15]. To avoid moisture in ambient air during the fabrication process of PSCs, most groups prepare PSCs inside a N 2 -filled glove box. There are also several research groups, who found that when perovskite materials were prepared in glovebox under inert atmosphere, the resulting perovskite films remained poorly crystalline, but, once exposed to a <b>special</b> controlled humidity <b>atmosphere,</b> a rapid crystallization into highly oriented crystallites was observed [16 – 19].
