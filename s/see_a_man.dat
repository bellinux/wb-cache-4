She found it to be a bold statement and inquired about the man, {{who turned out to be}} Zackie Achmat, a South African activist, film director, and co-founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). Although the singer had been associated with the 46664 campaign, being introduced to Achmat gave her an opportunity to do more for the campaign and the project.|$|E
500|$|Jassin {{writes that}} Amir {{maintained}} a Malay identity throughout his works, despite attending schools run by Europeans. Unlike {{the works of}} his contemporaries Alisjahbana or Sanusi Pane, his poems did not include symbols of a Europeanised modernity such as electricity, trains, telephones, and engines, allowing [...] "the natural Malay world to show wholly". Ultimately, when reading Amir's poems [...] "in our imagination we do not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in pants, a jacket, and tie, but a youth in traditional Malay garb". Mihardja notes that Amir wrote his works {{at a time when}} all of their classmates, and many poets elsewhere, were [...] "pouring their hearts or thoughts" [...] in Dutch, or, if [...] "able to free themselves from the shackles of Dutch", in a local language.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2010 NFL Draft, Kafka was {{projected}} to be drafted in the sixth round by NFLDraftScout.com and {{as high as the}} fourth round. He was rated as the eleventh-best quarterback in the draft. Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald said at the time that 85 NFL scouts, general managers and personnel directors who watched film or came to see a game or a practice said about Kafka was that he [...] "throws a lot better than our No. 3 [...] does right now." [...] Fitzgerald also said that he would be [...] "shocked" [...] if Kafka was not drafted in the 2010 NFL Draft. After the Outback Bowl loss to Auburn on January 1, in which Kafka threw 78 passes for 532yards, Fitzgerald said, [...] "I hope the NFL sees the same thing that I <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with a big-time arm." [...] An NFL general manager said at the 2010 Senior Bowl that Kafka could be drafted as high as the third round.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, {{she opened}} the front door of Kenwood to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who [...] "looked like a tramp", but with her husband's features. He {{explained}} that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
500|$|Desmond flashbacks: {{the hatch}} is shown imploding again, and then Desmond (who was inside) {{suddenly}} {{wakes up in}} a London apartment with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger). Desmond is clearly puzzled, but is relieved to finally be with Penny again. Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time {{on the island and}} predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible. Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible. While shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> crushed to death by falling scaffolding. She explains that although she knew the man would die, she did not help because the universe has a way of [...] "course correcting", and he would die anyway. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture, where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true (proving that he really knew about the future, but that his timing was off), but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out. Desmond wakes up back on the Island, completely naked, as seen in [...] "Further Instructions".|$|E
