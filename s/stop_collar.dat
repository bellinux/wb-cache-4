5000|$|Berlin S-Bahn {{rapid transit}} uses a metal bar as the trip arm, {{positioned}} {{at the height}} of the first bogie, on which the trip cock is placed. The metal bar (also named [...] "Streckenanschlag" [...] / track <b>stop</b> <b>collar)</b> folds away to allow passing.|$|E
5000|$|The Berlin S-Bahn {{commuter}} rail system {{has its own}} tracks that is completely separate from the national rail network although most lines run in parallel with the normal railways. Although a heavy rail system the vehicle fleet is specialized for the Berlin rail network with its closest cousins in the S-Bahn Hamburg (which switched to 1200 Volt however instead of 750 Volt third rail in Berlin). Berlin {{was among the first}} to introduce an automated train protection system based on metal bar at the height of the first bogie where the trip cock is placed. The metal bar (also named [...] "Streckenanschlag" [...] / track <b>stop</b> <b>collar)</b> folds away to allow passing. If the metal bar is up it will also catch the train by sliding along the outer frame. The train stops are installed at some distance before the actual critical point (junction, station) so that with an assumed maximum speed the train can be halted.|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous skin access devices {{include a}} {{plurality}} of locked connecting units mounted to the exterior surface of an implantable medical object which, in position, is configured to penetrate {{the skin of a}} subject. The locked connecting units may be mounted directly onto the desired surface of the exterior of the device or may be held on a substrate sheet, which is mounted to the exterior surface of the device. In position, the locked connecting units engage with soft tissue which can include the skin to form a bio-junction layer which includes mechanical and bio-sealing connection between the device body and the soft tissue. The configuration at the bio-junction layer secures the medical object in location in the subject even for long-term indwelling applications in a manner, which inhibits soft tissue infection. The locked connecting units may be rigid or semi-rigid for longer-term indwelling applications, and semi-rigid and/or resilient for shorter term indwelling applications. The locked connecting units may take on the form of rings, hooks, or loops having aperture or gap width/length sizes of from about 0. 2 4 mm. The rings, loops, or hooks may connect with any soft tissue including skin as well subcutaneous tissue. The rings, hooks, or loops may be released from the skin/tissue without requiring surgical cutting procedures. The locked connecting units may be configured as a semi-rigid mesh collar arranged about the primary body providing access to the subject such that it resides in the subject and engages with the skin (epidermal/dermal layer). The mesh collar can be described as a particular type of ring or loop structure as the mesh defines the gap provided in individual loop configurations. The mesh collar may be used alone, or in combination with the loops, rings, or hooks. A skin <b>stop</b> <b>collar</b> having increased rigidity may be disposed under the mesh collar...|$|E

500|$|In January 2014 it was {{reported}} that [...] "Fleet", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the University of Brighton in partnership with the BBC's Winterwatch, had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in Hove, at the western edge of East Sussex, across rural countryside as far as Rye, at {{the eastern edge of the}} county. He was still continuing his journey when the GPS <b>collar</b> <b>stopped</b> transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.|$|R

I killed him {{because he wanted to}} run away with her. I killed him because I found him waiting for her {{at the door of the}} barn at the dead o' night, when she'd got outer bed to jine him.

40|$|Objective: CAD-CAM {{technology}} allows clinicians to plan implant {{position on}} CT images and to fabricate customized surgical templates for transferring {{this information to}} the surgical field. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the accuracy of a new device (SAFE SurgiGuide) of a CAD-CAM system for implant placement (Simplant®-Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) compared with the traditional one (SurgiGuide). Methods: Ten patients were included and were treated with the Simplant® system. All patients received a scannographic template and underwent CT-Dentascan. CT images were used for planning implant positioning with the SimplantPro® software. Patients were divided into two groups: “SAFE SurgiGuide Group” (SSG), and “SurgiGuide Group” (SGG). Those in the SSG received implants with the SAFE SurgiGuide device, which uses special drills with <b>stopping</b> depth <b>collars,</b> one template with changeable drilling cylinders, and implant holders for fixture placement. In the SGG, 3 different templates (SurgiGuide) were used in each patient to guide drilling. Eighty-eight implants were placed. Two months after surgery, a control CT-scan was taken, and images of planned and placed implants were compared. Results: Success rates for repetition of virtual and planned implant positions were: on the vestibular-oral/lingual axis, SSG = 98. 35 % vs. SGG = 47. 39 %; on the mesio-distal axis, SSG = 89. 4 % vs. SGG = 65. 73 %; and whole SSG = 96. 62 % vs. SGG = 56. 97 %. The distance from anatomical reference structures was always respected. Conclusions: The Simplant® System allows clinicians to make precise pre-surgical evaluations and treatment programs, and to transfer them securely to the surgical phase. Better results seemed to be obtained with the Safe SurgiGuide...|$|R
5000|$|The cat {{should be}} taken to a veterinarian. The most {{suspected}} cause of skin problems in cats will be fleas. Other causes of over-grooming are not as easily ascertained. As household antiseptics are known to be toxic to cats, veterinary antiseptics for cats can be used to treat open sores, if they do occur. Sores can also be treated with cream, oral or injected anti-inflammatories, however if the problem continues to recur it may be more cost effective to subject the cat to laboratory testing early on. It may be difficult to keep a clean dressing on a cat's belly, and an anti-lick collar is adequate to let the wound heal. If an anti lick collar is used, a soft anti-lick collar is less cumbersome, although they are less durable. If the cat wears a plastic anti-lick collar, it may use the edge of the collar to grind against existing wounds, making them worse. A soft anti lick collar will become less effective as it is kicked out of the shape by the cat's hind leg, and will need prompt replacement. The cat can sanitize the wound if the collar is removed for daily short periods of time, also giving the cat an opportunity for an overall grooming. Scratches and wounds can heal completely using this method. When the cat <b>stops</b> wearing the <b>collar,</b> thinned hair, redness of skin or cracked nipples on the cat are early indicators that the cat has started to over-groom again.|$|R
40|$|Tigers (Panthera tigris) are wide-ranging species, and a {{permeable}} landscape matrix outside Protected Areas (PAs) {{is extremely}} important for their dispersal. A tigress which had fallen in a water duct in the Nagpur district was rescued by the Forest Department on 12 th October, 2011 and released on 27 th November, 2011 in a forest adjacent {{to the site of}} capture. A GPS-GSM collar that we fitted on her indicated that she remained in the same forest area until 25 th December, 2011, and then moved eastwards into a human-dominated landscape where she was present until 25 th March, 2012, after which the GPS battery ceased to function. She moved a minimum distance of 454. 65 km from the time of her release up to 25 th March, 2012, using a total area of 726 kmÂ² (95 % MCP), but between 30 th December, 2011 and 25 th March, 2012, after moving into the human-dominated forest-agricultural landscape her home range was 431 kmÂ² (95 % MCP). Her home range also encompassed villages, roads and croplands. Her activity was largely nocturnal and she rested in dense foliage inside forest patches during the day. About half of all the prey items that we identified during this period (n = 12) were wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Although, she was present very close to areas where humans were active in the day, no untoward incident occurred. She was photographed in April 2013, a year after the <b>collar</b> <b>stopped</b> functioning, in the same region about 40 km from the release site, indicating that she is still present in the human-dominated area. Very little is known about tiger ecology, and their temporal and spatial patterns of movement, outside PAs. These areas will be crucial in terms of dispersal between PAs as well as sensitive in terms of conflict...|$|R
