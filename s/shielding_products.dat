40|$|Underutilized and surplus lead {{stocks and}} leaded {{components}} {{are a common}} legacy environmental problem {{across much of the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. While seeking to dispose of these items through its Environmental Management Program, DOE operational programs continue to pursue contemporary mission requirements such as managing and/or storing radioactive isotopes that require lead materials for shielding. This paradox was identified in late 1999 when DOE's policies for managing scrap metal were assessed. In January 2000, the Secretary of Energy directed the National Center of Excellence for Materials Recycle (NMR) to develop and implement a comprehensive lead reuse program for all of DOE. Fluor Hanford, contractor for DOE Richland Operations, subsequently contacted NMR to pilot lead reclamation and reuse at the Hanford Site. This relationship resulted {{in the development of a}} beneficial reuse pathway for lead reclaimed from spent fuel transport railcars being stored at Hanford. The 1. 3 million pounds of lead in the railcars is considered radiologically encumbered due to its prior use. Further, the material was considered a mixed Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) low-level radioactive waste that would require expensive storage or macro encapsulation to meet land disposal restrictions prior to burial. Working closely with Flour Hanford and the Office of Air, Water, and Radiation (EH- 412), NMR developed a directed reuse pathway for this and other radiologically encumbered lead. When derived supplemental release limits were used, the lead recovered from these railcars became eligible for reuse in <b>shielding</b> <b>products</b> to support DOE and commercial nuclear industry operations. Using this disposition pathway has saved Hanford one third of the cost of disposing of the lead and the cost of acquiring additional lead for nuclear shielding applications. Furthermore, the environmental costs associated with mining and producing new lead for <b>shielding</b> <b>products</b> a nd stewardship of the waste was eliminated. Methods and processes developed in cooperation with Fluor Hanford are applicable to, and have been successfully applied to, lead stocks at DOE sites such as Savannah River, Mound, Los Alamos, and Idaho...|$|E

However, the development of ZnO-based UV <b>shielding</b> <b>products</b> is currently hindered due to the adverse effects of the inherent photocatalytic activity exhibited by ZnO. This paper reports our recent study on the possibility of reducing the photoactivity of ZnO nanoparticles via surface modification and impurity doping. It was found that the photoactivity was drastically reduced by SiO 2 -coatings that were applied to ZnO quantum dots using the Stöber method and a microemulsion technique. The effect of transition metal doping on the photoactivity was also studied using mechanochemical processing and a co-precipitation method. Cobalt doping reduced the photoactivity, while manganese doping led to mixed results, possibly due to the difference in the location of dopant ions derived from the difference in the synthesis methods. <br /...|$|E

METHODS: Two hundred and forty seven strains of streptococci and enterococci were tested with each kit by one operator {{and according to the}} manufacturer's instructions. Strains failing to group or giving discordant results were identified to species level. RESULTS: Two discrepant grouping results were observed and 13 non-beta haemolytic streptococci failed to group with either <b>product.</b> The <b>Shield</b> kit successfully identified 232 isolates at 15 minutes of enzyme extraction incubation compared with 224 and 233 on short (15 minutes) and long (1 hour) incubations, respectively, for Streptex (p > 0. 23 for both comparisons). On short incubation only, the Shield kit detected significantly more strains of Enterococcus faecium (p = 0. 007). The reaction strengths were similar for both kits (p > 0. 16).

40|$|Respiratory {{disease in}} beef calves has been {{associated}} with the stress of weaning. Management practices commonly delay vaccination of calves to this time, and weaning stress could potentially suppress the immune response. To reduce this stress we have been experimenting with a procedure termed “pasture weaning” in which the dams are removed and the calves remain on pasture. Observation suggests that calves weaned with this approach adapt to the weaned state much better than those held in drylot. Consequently, one would expect less stress-mediated effects including those on the immune system. Calves were weaned and assigned to groups that were pasture or drylot weaned, and calves within the groups were vaccinated with one of two inactivated virus vaccines by either the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Weaning placement did not affect antibody responses to the viruses included in the vaccines. The route of administration did not influence responses with subcutaneous injection inducing responses equivalent to the intramuscular site. Utilization of this route for vaccination could be advantageous because it precludes the tissue damage and hidden abscessation that sometimes results from intramuscular injections. A distinct difference was noted in the immunogenicity of the vaccines with the Vira <b>Shield</b> <b>product</b> yielding significantly better responses to all viral entities...|$|R
