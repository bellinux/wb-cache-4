5000|$|In an MSC {{an arrow}} is usually an {{asynchronous}} message sent from one entity to another one. Once {{the message is}} sent the <b>sending</b> <b>entity</b> resumes its execution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sending</b> <b>Entity</b> prepends a Security Header (the Command Header) to the Application Message. It then {{applies the}} {{requested}} security to {{part of the}} Command Header {{and all of the}} Application Message, including any padding octets. The resulting structure is here referred to as the (Secured) Command Packet.|$|E
5000|$|The IETF {{proposed}} a protocol to exchange reputation data. [...] It was originally aimed at email applications, {{but it was}} subsequently developed as a general architecture for a reputation-based service, followed by an email-specific part. [...] However, the workhorse of email reputation remains with DNSxL's, which do not follow that protocol. [...] Those specification don't say how to collect feedback —in fact, the granularity of email <b>sending</b> <b>entities</b> makes it impractical to collect feedback directly from recipients— but are only concerned with reputation query/response methods.|$|R
50|$|Three limited series (Ultimate Nightmare, Ultimate Secret and Ultimate Extinction) {{introduce}} the threatening entity Gah Lak Tus. First mentioned by the robot Ultimate Vision, Gah Lak Tus {{is a group}} mind of city-sized robotic drones. The drones use envoys similar to the Silver Surfer, who introduce a flesh-eating virus into planets. Gah Lak Tus merges with Galactus when a temporal rift <b>sends</b> the <b>entity</b> enters the Ultimate Marvel universe.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) Simulation Package (CSP) {{interoperability}} for {{one type of}} distributed simulation problem, namely synchronous entity passing. Synchronous entity passing is {{also referred to as}} the bounded buffer interoperability reference model. It deals with the case where for entities passed between models the receiving queue is bounded or the receiving workstation has limited capacity. This means the sending model must check the status of the receiving model before it can <b>send</b> <b>entities.</b> Correspondingly, the receiving model should update the status information dynamically when it changes. Similar to the work done on asynchronous entity passing, the High Level Architecture is chosen as the underlying standard to support reuse and interoperability. To simplify the integration of the CSP and the HLA, a middleware layer called DSManager is provided. Some new problems generated for synchronous entity passing are discussed and solutions are proposed together with a description of their implementation. Two sets of experiments are conducted to evaluate the solutions using a CSP Emulator (CSPE) which supports both standalone and distributed simulation...|$|R
50|$|Under normal {{circumstances}} the Receiving Entity receives the Command Packet and unpacks it {{according to the}} security parameters indicated in the Command Header. The Receiving Entity subsequently forwards the Application Message to the Receiving Application indicating to the Receiving Application the security that was applied. The interface between the Sending Application and <b>Sending</b> <b>Entity</b> and the interface between the Receiving Entity and Receiving Application are proprietary.|$|E
50|$|If so {{indicated}} in the Command Header, the Receiving Entity shall create a (Secured) Response Packet. The Response Packet consists of a Security Header (the Response Header) and optionally, application specific data supplied by the Receiving Application. Both the Response Header and the application specific data are secured using the security mechanisms {{indicated in}} the received Command Packet. The Response Packet {{will be returned to}} the <b>Sending</b> <b>Entity,</b> subject to constraints in the transport layer, (e.g. timing).|$|E
5000|$|The final {{television}} story ends on a cliffhanger. Apparently {{resentful of}} Sapphire and Steel's independence, a higher authority <b>sends</b> <b>entities</b> known as Transient Beings (similar to the operatives but until now {{trapped in the}} past), to set a trap for them in a motorway café. The serial concludes with Silver dispatched to an unknown fate [...] - [...] and Sapphire and Steel being trapped in the café, floating through space, apparently for eternity. The cliffhanger has never been resolved, although Hammond has stated that vague plans existed for further adventures. This was also stated by Joanna Lumley in her autobiography, who remembered that {{they were told that}} this was merely an end-of-season cliffhanger, and that Sapphire and Steel would be freed {{at the start of the}} next series. However, in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine (#329, cover date: 30 April 2003), David Collings recalled that although another series was planned, Joanna Lumley and David McCallum both decided that they'd had enough and didn't wish to do any more.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{the studios}} of CoastAlaska (a {{regional}} public radio station consortium), are located in Juneau. AP (the Associated Press), Anchorage news outlets, and other Alaska media <b>entities,</b> <b>send</b> reporters to Juneau during the annual Legislative session.|$|R
5000|$|The {{session layer}} {{may provide the}} {{following}} services to the presentation layer: establishment and release of session connections, normal and expedited data exchange, a quarantine service which allows the <b>sending</b> presentation <b>entity</b> to instruct the receiving session entity not to release data to its presentation entity without permission, interaction management so presentation entities can control whose turn it is to perform certain control functions, resynchronization of a session connection, reporting of unrecoverable exceptions to the presentation entity.|$|R
50|$|Strange {{situations}} {{have also}} been occurring in school. A dark entity comes out and forces everyone to become depressed. When someone resists, the dark <b>entity</b> <b>sends</b> monsters that cause extensive damage. One {{of the first people}} to become possessed under this entity was Toma, the new president of the student advisory.|$|R
5000|$|James S. Gordon, Jr. (“Gordon”), was {{the manager}} and sole member of Omni Innovations, LLC (“Omni”), a {{self-described}} [...] "spam-business".

30|$|This model also {{provides}} InPs an additional incentive {{to participate in}} finding an embedding for a given virtual network as it will receive compensation for its work. When an <b>entity</b> <b>sends</b> an EMBED message to another entity, it enters a contractual agreement to pay a processing fee up to an upper bound it specifies.|$|R
50|$|The two-digit {{transaction}} reference number means that an <b>entity</b> <b>sending</b> text messages {{can only have}} 100 outstanding messages (per session); this can limit performance, but only over a slow network and with incorrectly configured applications on one's SMSC (for example one session, with number of windows greater than 100). In practice {{it does not have}} any impact on delivery throughput.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} NATLFED entities is their aggressive recruitment of new cadre {{from the ranks of}} volunteers who participate.The NATLFED <b>entities</b> <b>send</b> speakers to churches, residential neighborhoods, shopping centers, university campuses, music festivals, and other venues introducing themselves and soliciting volunteers and resources. At these events, organizers will read a brief introduction to the organization to new volunteers and try to schedule visits to their office and participation in volunteer run activities.|$|R
5000|$|In another case, the {{businessman}} Andi Gurczynska Roberto, {{who worked as}} security for the directors of BANCOOP, said in testimony to the CPI that BANCOOP had been <b>sending</b> notes to <b>entities,</b> in exchange for receiving 10X that value in the entities' accounts.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the {{efficiency}} of token-based strategies for the basic problem of controlling the allocation of a shared resource in a ring of n processing entities. We propose new protocols that allow a bounded number of exchanged messages per access request to the resource, while this amount is unbounded for classical solutions. We also guarantee all the requests to be served within a maximum delay. The new proposed protocols are request-message-based strategies, in that a process <b>entity</b> <b>sends</b> a message to “inform ” the token of the access request...|$|R
40|$|In {{distributed}} systems, {{group communication}} among multiple entities {{is required in}} addition to the conventional one-to-one communication. Group communication protocols provide multiple entities with reliable data transmission service, i. e. messages are delivered to all the destination entities in the group. It is also important to guarantee that every application entity can receive messages in a well-defined order in the presence of multiple <b>entities</b> <b>sending</b> messages. This paper discusses logical properties of the group communication. We present communication protocols to provide various kinds of group communication services and evaluate the protocols...|$|R
5000|$|For version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol, the chunked {{transfer}} {{mechanism is}} considered to be always and anyways acceptable, even if not listed in the TE (transfer encoding) request header field, and when used with other transfer mechanisms, should always be applied last to the transferred data and never more than one time. This transfer coding method also allows additional entity header fields to be sent after the last chunk if the client specified the [...] "trailers" [...] parameter as an argument of the TE field. The origin server of the response can also decide to <b>send</b> additional <b>entity</b> trailers even if the client did not specify the [...] "trailers" [...] option in the TE request field, but only if the metadata is optional (i.e. the client can use the received entity without them). Whenever the trailers are used, the server should list their names in the Trailer header field; three header field types are specifically prohibited from appearing as a trailer field: Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length and Trailer.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{is simply an}} imitation MTA which gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server which gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays/proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources and potentially revealing information about themselves and {{the origin of the}} spam they are <b>sending</b> to the <b>entity</b> that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis.|$|R
50|$|Later, as an interdimensional portal transported four villains {{from the}} 616 Marvel Universe into the Ultraverse dimension, the Phoenix Force was {{pulled into the}} Ultraverse as well and was {{critically}} damaged. Needing a human host to help heal the damage, the Phoenix Force bonded with Prime and soon afterwards with Amber Hunt. Amber was unable to control it. She attacked her friends and would have destroyed the planet, {{if not for the}} arrival of the X-Men and new Ultra hero Foxfire, who after a long battle were able to separate the Phoenix from Amber and <b>send</b> the cosmic <b>entity</b> back to the 616 universe.|$|R
50|$|Although {{messages}} {{may often}} include {{information about the}} <b>entity</b> <b>sending</b> a message, that information may not be accurate. Digital signatures {{can be used to}} authenticate the source of messages. When ownership of a digital signature secret key is bound to a specific user, a valid signature shows that the message was sent by that user. The importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose a bank's branch office sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly sent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a grave mistake.|$|R
50|$|Searching for {{her missing}} father on Earth, the heroine Zatanna had faced the Druid {{alongside}} the size-changing Ray Palmer. Zatanna had read ancient manuscripts and {{learned of the}} land of Ys. She tried to conjure the blue flame but was able to stop it from bringing her to the Other Side of the World when she learned how truly powerful it was. Her magic kept her held between Earth and Ys. Forced to find another avenue to Earth, the Warlock sought out the power ring of Green Lantern Hal Jordan. Zatanna was aware of this but could not prevent the Warlock from using her as a stepping stone to <b>send</b> a sorcerous <b>entity,</b> Patch-Eye Pete the Pirate, to draw Green Lantern into his clutches. Zatanna dueled with the Warlock's magic and granted Green Lantern her powers.|$|R

40|$|Cyber-physical {{systems like}} robots and {{self-driving}} vehicles comprise complex software systems. Their software is typically realized as distributed agents {{that are responsible}} for dedicated tasks like sensor data handling, sensor data fusion, or action planning. The modular design allows a flexible deployment as well as algorithm encapsulation to exchange software modules where needed. Such distributed software exchanges data using a data marshalling layer to serialize and deserialize data structures between a <b>sending</b> and receiving <b>entity.</b> In this article, we are systematically evaluating Google Protobuf, LCM, and our self-adaptive delta marshalling approach by using a generic description language, of which instances can be composed at runtime.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to provide}} selective group communication for multiple entities in a distributed system by using less-reliable broadcast communication services. In the group communication, a protocol data unit (PDU) sent by each entity has to be delivered atomically to all the destinations in the group. In distributed applications, each <b>entity</b> <b>sends</b> a PDU only to a subset rather than all the entities, and each entity receives only PDUs destined to it from every entity {{in the same order}} as they are sent. We name such a broadcast service a selective order-preserving broadcast (SP) service. In this paper, we discuss how to design a distributed protocol which provides the SP service for entities by using the less-reliable broadcast network in the presence of PDU loss. The SP service can be a useful facility for designing and implementing distributed systems like groupware. 1 1 Introduction In distributed applications like teleconferencing and cooperative work in groupw [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia is a {{collection}} of some 6,000 islands in the South Pacific ocean that includes approximately 100,000 people. The nation is composed of several states that each embody a prominent ethnic group amongst the island group, and lies approximately three-quarters of the way between Hawaii and Indonesia. After World War II, the Micronesian island chain became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia became an independent country on 1986, but freely associates with the United States, which handles matters of defense. The Federated States of Micronesia sent its first delegation to participate in the Olympics approximately 14 years after it became a sovereign <b>entity,</b> <b>sending</b> three men and two women to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Between then and Beijing in 2008, three male and two female Micronesian athletes participating across three sports have appeared at the Olympics at every instance.

40|$|Systems {{that provide}} network traffic {{anonymity}} typically focus on wide-area network topologies, and exploit the infeasibility of eavesdropping on all links to prevent attackers from determining communication peers. This approach is inappropriate for high-security wireless localarea networks, since {{it does not}} obscure the traffic volume, allowing attackers to identify critical nodes (e. g., a military HQ) and, given the ability of an attacker to obtain a global view of all communications, the relative ease of identifying the source and destination of traffic flows. These weaknesses derive from the fact that, whereas in wide-area networks the sender, the receiver and the adversary are on different physical links, in wireless networks they may share a single broadcast link. Moreover, the adversary can easily find the physical location of the transmitter and thereby identify the <b>entity</b> <b>sending</b> the traffic, not just its network identity. We introduce Wireless Anonymous Routing (war), an approach to achieve anonymity in a broadcast network. We describe a formal threat model for war and {{compare it to the}} traditional anonymity approaches. We show that these are inadequate when applied to the broadcast model, and describe new protocols that preserve security with better performance, adequately addressing the requirements of security-critical environments. We provide analytical and some preliminary experimental evidence that our protocols achieve anonymity at a reasonable cost...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} influencing factors on the transfer of Human Resource Management (HRM) practices in Multinational Corporations (MNCs), a topic embedded in International Business (IB) and more precise in International Human Resource Management (IHRM). It builds on the debate of international dominance, transfer motives, and the different viewpoints on the triggers, impacts, and processes related to the topic. Recently the institutional analysis of transfer of management practices that seeks the impact in the institutional surrounding of the <b>sending</b> and receiving <b>entities</b> has been criticized of not {{taking into account the}} actors on the micro-level. In this sense the (regional) headquarter or subsidiary level or the actors at those levels and their active role in the transfer process of practices need to be paid higher attention to. Especially the detection of actors’ different sources of power needs to be moved to the limelight. The analyitical perspective adopted in this dissertation therefor is a combined approach of macro-level (institutional) and micro-level (actor-related) factors in order to fully catch and understand the transfer flow and outcome. Exploring on this the study is based on a comprehensively developed framework enfolding multiple tested and evidenced models to gain further insight into recently set-off debates. The present study demonstrates that the actor-related approach shall not be neglected as it plays the major part in the transfer process in an MNC context. The study shows that depending on the set-up and involved actors institutional effects can be leveraged or dominated by political action in the majority of all cases. Therefore institutional impacts as such tend to be overrated as stand-alone effects in an HRM transfer process in existing literature. Micro-level impacts are the main driver in a process that had been seen as mainly institutionally impacted. Even though home-country and host-country effects constitute the origin of some differences the main transfer impacts are actor-related. Local mind-sets, preferences and resistances can lead to adoption, hybridization or adaptation of country-of-origin practices as show the transfer outcomes even in less state-coordinated and thus institutionally impacted environments...|$|R
