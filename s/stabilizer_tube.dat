5000|$|The Grenade Projection Adapter was an {{expedient}} {{rifle grenade}} {{used by the}} American Military in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. It consisted of an add-on 22mm <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tube</b> and fins that converted a hand-grenade into a rifle grenade. It was supplemented by the M17 rifle grenade, and eventually made obsolete by the 40 mm M79 grenade launcher.|$|E
5000|$|... "GRENADE, ANTITANK, M9Al —STANDARD— The antitank grenade, M9A1, has a {{sheet steel}} body and tail {{assembly}} and weighs 1.23 pounds. The body {{is filled with}} 4 ounces of Pentolite using the “hollow charge” principle. The tail contains the impact fuze and the stabilizing fin is spot welded on a <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tube</b> screwed to the head. The impact fuze consists of a firing pin held by a spring in flight. When shipped, the firing pin is retained by a safety pin. When the grenade strikes a target the pin moves forward to activate the detonator and explode the charge. The hollow shaped charge of this grenade has remarkable armor-penetrating qualities, The M9Al anti-tank rifle grenade supersedes the grenade, A.T., M9."WAR DEPARTMENT, INFANTRY FIELD MANUAL § WEAPON AND AMMUNITION TECHNICAL MANUAL, INFANTRY REGIMENT, PARACHUTE, June 1944, Page 43 ...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{inertial}} forces {{driving the}} arming process of fuse safety system mechanisms {{are determined by}} the parameters of shell motion in the barrel. The motion of the elements of fuse mechanisms is studied in a non-inertial coordinate system. Reasonable consideration of the reliability of unlocking the safety stages during the shot is obviously possible only when there is an adequate description of the inertia forces. The arming of inertial type safety mechanism should be completed before the moment when the level of the axial inertia force reaches a certain value rated to the maximum level (determined by the arming safety factor). Classical methods of internal ballistics do not identify the parameters of the part of the setback which is important for fuse arming. In the traditional method of calculating the process of mortar firing the pressure required to break the perforations in the tail <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tube</b> of the mortar shell performs the role of a "forcing pressure", and consequently the combustion of the main charge is supposed to begin instantaneously, i. e. it acts merely as an igniter for the additional charge. In reality (physically) there is some initial portion of the pressure rise and, correspondingly, the force of inertia (setback). An approach is proposed to the study of a shot from a mortar based on consideration of the temporal process of the propellant gases flow after breaking the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tube</b> perforations in the space behind the mortar shell. It is assumed that the ignition of the additional charge and the movement of shell begin simultaneously. This approach allows one to identify the leading portion of the setback curve, allowing a more adequate description of fuse mechanisms functioning during arming. The periods of shot are considered consecutively in cases of absence and availability of the additional charge. Differential equations are reduced to dimensionless form simplifying the procedure of computer aided solution. A comparison of the calculation results for the 82 -mm mortar shells {{on the basis of the}} proposed and conventional techniques is presented. It is shown that the integral parameters of the shot (the pressure on the muzzle and the initial velocity of the shell) are quite close to each other. </p...|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} model XA remains popular on {{the used}} aircraft market and aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational {{use and the}} rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, wing root tube brackets, flying wire shackles and tail boom tubes. Cracked aft vertical <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tubes</b> and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in used aircraft.|$|R
30|$|The {{method of}} Liu et al. ([2010]) was {{modified}} for protoplast formation and regeneration. A 5 -mm culture disk of the fungus used was placed {{near the edge}} of a PDA plate (9 cm diam). After incubation at 24 °C for 3 days, four culture disks were obtained from the advancing margin of the colony and placed on a cellophane disk (9 cm diam) laid on V- 8 beef extract agar containing 1 % V- 8 juice, 0.1 % beef extract and 2 % agar. After incubation at 24 °C for 12 h, the culture disks were cut off with a sterile scalpel and the cellophane disk was placed in 300 ml sterile distilled water in a 500 -ml beaker. The mycelial mat was transferred to 25 ml V- 8 broth consisting of 5 % V- 8 juice centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min and adjusted to pH 6 with 1 N NaOH in a 250 -ml-flask. After incubation at 24 °C under light for 24 h, the mycelial mat with numerous young hyphae was transferred to a sterile 8 -cm screen (Buckbee Mears, St. Paul, MN) with 150 -μm pore size, rinsed with 200 ml sterile distilled water and placed in 5 ml stabilizer solution I (0.6 M manitol, 0.04 M CaCl 2, and 0.01 M Tis-HCl, pH 7.5) mixed with 50 mg Drislase (D- 9515, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 25 mg lysing enzymes (L- 1412, Sigma) in a 15 -ml centrifuge <b>tube.</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> solution with enzymes was sterilized by filtration through 0.22 μm membrane filter (Millex, Millipore, Co Cork, Ireland). The centrifuge tube containing the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and 34 °C for 105 min with gentle shaking to release protoplasts. Protoplasts were separated from non-digested mycelial fragments by filtration through a Whatman No. 113 filter paper (30 -μm pore size) and the filtrate was collected in another centrifuge tube. To remove the lytic enzymes, 1 ml 0.8 M mannitol solution was pipetted onto the bottom of the centrifuge tube containing the protoplast suspension before centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the lytic enzymes was discarded and protoplasts retained in the bottom portion were used for regeneration.|$|R
