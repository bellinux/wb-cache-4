40|$|Accurate {{phenotyping}} of {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) can be difficult in transfusion-dependent patients such as those with thalassemia and <b>sickle</b> <b>cells</b> <b>anemia</b> {{because of the presence}} of previously transfused RBCs in the patient's circulation. Recently, the molecular basis associated with the expression of many blood group antigens was established. This allowed the development of a plethora of polymerase chain reaction-based tests for identification of the blood group antigens by testing DNA. The determination of blood group polymorphism at the genomic level facilitates the resolution of clinical problems that cannot be addressed by hemagglutination. They are useful to (a) determine antigen types for which currently available antibodies are weakly reactive; (b) type patients who have been recently transfused; (c) identify fetuses at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn; and (d) to increase the reliability of repositories of antigen negative RBCs for transfusion. It is important to note that PCR based assays are prone to different types of errors that those observed with hemagglutination assays. For instance, contamination with amplified products may lead to false positive test results. In addition, the identification of a particular genotype does not necessarily mean that the antigen will be expressed on the RBC membrane...|$|R

40|$|Hemoglobin (Hb) -based oxygen {{carriers}} (HBOCs) {{are being developed}} as a potential therapy for increasing tissue oxygenation, yet they have not reached their full potential because of unwanted hemodynamic side effects (vasoconstriction, low cardiac output, and oxygen delivery) {{due in part to}} nitric oxide (NO) scavenging by cell-free Hb. It may be possible to overcome the NO scavenging effect by coinfusing S-nitrosylated (SNO) HBOC along with unmodified HBOC. SNO-HBOC, like free Hb, may act as an NO donor in low-oxygen conditions. We hypothesized that an unaltered HBOC, polymerized bovine Hb (PBvHb), coinfused with an SNO-PBvHb, would improve hemodynamics and oxygen delivery during hypoxia. Vascular oxygen content and hemodynamics were determined after euvolemic rats were infused (3 ml) with lactated Ringer's solution, PBvHb, SNO-PBvHb, or PBvHb plus SNO-PBvHb (1 : 10) during normoxia or acute hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 10 %, 120 min). Hemodynamic side effects resulting from PBvHb infusion (vasoconstriction, elevated pulmonary blood pressure, and reduced cardiac output) were offset by SNO-PBvHb in acute hypoxic, but not normoxic, conditions. These data support the potential use of HBOC mixed with SNO-HBOC for the treatment of conditions in which acute hypoxia is present, such as tumor oxygenation, wound healing, hemorrhagic trauma, and <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> and hemolytic <b>anemia...</b>|$|R

25|$|There is {{biological}} {{variation in}} the human species—with traits such as blood type, cranial features, eye color, hair color and type, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. Human body types vary substantially. The typical height of an adult human is between , although this varies significantly depending, among other things, on sex and ethnic origin. Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns, especially as an influence in childhood. Adult height for each sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues to human evolutionary history, or are relevant to medical research, have received particular attention. For example, the genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary diseases such as <b>sickle</b> <b>cell</b> <b>anemia</b> are frequent in populations where malaria has been endemic throughout history—it is believed that the same gene gives increased resistance to malaria {{among those who are}} unaffected carriers of the gene. Similarly, populations that have for a long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. Similarly, skin color varies clinally with darker skin around the equator—where the added protection from the sun's ultraviolet radiation is thought to give an evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer to the poles.|$|E
