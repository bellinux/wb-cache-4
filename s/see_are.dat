The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we <b>see</b> <b>are</b> not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time. A highly {{detailed description of the}} scene was written, as Chaplin considered it {{to be the center of}} the entire film.|$|E
5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to <b>see</b> <b>are</b> habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E

500|$|Generally, {{the party}} wants a stricter {{immigration}} policy, {{so that only}} {{those who are in}} need of protection according to the UN Refugee Convention are allowed to stay in Norway. In a speech in the 2007 election campaign, Siv Jensen claimed that the immigration policy was a failure because it let criminals stay in Norway, while throwing out people who worked hard and followed the law. The party claims the immigration and integration policy to be naïve. In 2009, the party proposed an official goal of reducing accepted asylum seekers by about 90%, from 1,000 to 100 a month, the standards then said to be used in Denmark and Finland, although less than 100 a year was proposed in 2008. In 2008, the party wanted to [...] "avoid illiterates and other poorly resourced groups who we <b>see</b> <b>are</b> not able to adapt in Norway"; which included countries as Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The party opposes that asylum seekers are allowed stay in Norway on humanitarian grounds or due to health issues, and seeks to substantially limit the number of family reunifications. The party has also called for a referendum on the general immigration policy.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in the early 2000s, Moffat refused to even mention Chalk, joking that he might get attacked in the street. The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as [...] "perverse" [...] and [...] "vapid", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. [...] Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as [...] "mentally unstable", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play {{at the time he}} was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend. The unions' derision actually inspired The Timess [...] Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying [...] "genuine humour" [...] such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, [...] "the teaching organisations, you <b>see,</b> <b>are</b> half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, but far more importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, we rarely find funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers is {{generally}} considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we <b>see</b> <b>are</b> tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E
