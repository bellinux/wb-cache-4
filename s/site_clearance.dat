From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. <b>Site</b> <b>clearance</b> work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Provided {{with the}} {{contributions}} of the linguistic turn, our perspective conceives political theorizing as an intervention of the researcher in an intersubjective context in which a public issue is debated. We focus on those contexts in which the exercise and claim for rights against the consequences of agribusiness is thematized: diseases and deaths, <b>site</b> <b>clearances</b> and evictions of indigenous and peasant communities, omission or complicit actions of the state institutions among other issues. We consider these diverse and sustained over time practices as struggles for recognition that put in tension the complacent “consensus of the commodities”, its concepts, practices, institutions and effects. We present the struggles against the pillars of agribusiness in Argentina: GMOs, pesticides and the National Commission on Agricultural Biotechnology (CONABIA). As a result of our research there are contributions that uncover the web of relationships impacted by agribusiness, the public problems generated and currently generates the technological innovation in this field, and the limits and possibilities for resolution. Also we offer glimpse into the structure, criteria and operation, also made invisible: the body of the official political system with responsibilities in this case in our country, the National Commission for Agricultural Technology (CONABIA). </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{long term}} {{plan of the}} Rees family, pursued by their son Howard, has been to build houses on the area of {{industrial}} activity, which would provide the capital required to both restore the house and estate buildings, and establish leisure and tourism facilities.

The author takes a critical look at these reconfigurations, and the resistances and manipulations that result when people (or their remains) are moved or placed {{in the name of}} coexistence, integration and sharing after the war. In this way, the article contributes to a post-conflict planning literature that is mostly concerned with overcoming segregation and cleansing through integration, by exploring some of the complexities and problems that can arise with unquestioned embrace of the latter. It shows that a very particular and problematic logic of ethnic coexistence and physical integration drives post-war respacing in Burundi and that people resist it with strategies in both physical and reflexive space. Proceeding through a set of paradoxes — such as the refusal to return and staying put, or re-emigration as a response to settling — the article explores how and why respacing-for-peace might produce, or fail to prevent, the opposite outcome: community conflict, social tension and segregation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Advancement in {{hardware}} and software technologies has allowed surveyors to complete the project at new level of precision. Presently surveyors rely on modern electronic based equipments, such as the total station and global positioning system to execute their daily tasks. 3 D terrestrial laser scanner {{is a relatively new}} technique in the Singapore local surveying industry. This system is capable of capturing large amount of 3 D spatial information, in the form of point clouds, in {{a very short period of}} time. As in any new surveying technique, its unknown capabilities and accuracies has always been a factor that prevents surveyors from investing in new equipment. Topography information and earthwork <b>site</b> <b>clearances</b> are the initial requirement in construction activities. Surveyors generally provide deliverable using the conventional method of surveying. This research project aims to examine the capabilities and accuracies of employing laser scanning technique to applications of earthwork and topographical surveys. To achieve this aim, a comparison of results generated by both the traditional and laser scanning methods were conducted at an excavation project site and at a strip of public road. Analysis of the results shown that the spatial information obtained by laser scanning were comparable to traditional survey in term of accuracy. Laser scanning has its advantages in earthwork application; however that is a need to integrate traditional total station in topographical survey...|$|R
2500|$|The Spodden Valley {{asbestos}} controversy {{arose in}} May 2004 when approximately [...] {{of land in}} Spodden Valley in Rochdale, England, formerly used by Turner Brothers Asbestos Company (later known as Turner & Newall), and {{the site of the}} world's largest asbestos textile factory, was sold to MMC Estates, a property developer. The developer subsequently submitted a planning application to Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council in December 2004 to build an [...] "urban village" [...] consisting of 650 homes, a children's daycare centre and a business park on the site. The planning application summary claimed: [...] "of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination". However, asbestos containing materials were abundantly visible on the ground, and local residents claimed that there were numerous asbestos dumping sites across the area, and that the woodland there had been heavily contaminated with asbestos dust. <b>Site</b> <b>clearance</b> work had begun as early as May 2004, prior to the submission of the application, including tree felling and soil disturbance, and some waste had been removed on flatbed trailers and open trucks.

2500|$|The Barking Riverside {{development}} {{is part of}} the London Riverside project, which aims to regenerate the Thames riverside area of East London through new homes, jobs, and services. Barking Riverside consists of [...] of brownfield land and therefore needs <b>site</b> <b>clearance</b> and the removal of overhead power lines before it can go ahead. Construction began in 2008, with completion due around 2025. 10,000 homes are to be built, housing around 25,000 people. New transport links will be provided, including East London Transit and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway at Barking Riverside DLR station, and City Hall is seeking £150 million to extend the Gospel Oak to Barking Line of the London Overground from Barking railway station to Barking Riverside. Barking and Dagenham Council has said that it does not believe the 10,800-home brownfield development to be viable without improved transport connections, and expects that the Treasury is likely to confirm funding in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn 2013 statement, due to be made on 4 December 2013. The development will also provide new public facilities, creating [...] "a variety of living, working, leisure and cultural amenities". Two new primary schools and one secondary school will be built, and the public will have access to two kilometres of Thames river front. The Rivergate Centre, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, provides the civic facilities for the initial phase of Barking Riverside, while a new square and 3FE primary school, which includes embedded community facilities, a nursery, church, flexible office suites for the PCT and Community Development Trust, as well as a MUGA and sports pitches are also planned. As yet unbuilt, the second phase provides 90 flats, local shops and a neighbourhood police post.|$|E

It was found that intravenous administration of 10 micrograms AIgG/kg body weight did not cause any detectable side effects in chimpanzees. In nine healthy volunteers, a dose of 10 micrograms AIgG/kg body weight was used without any adverse reactions. AIgG is cleared from the human circulation with a t 1 / 2 of 26 +/- 8 min (mean +/- SD). The <b>site</b> of <b>clearance</b> is predominantly the liver, as shown by an average liver spleen uptake ratio of 230 : 100. In whole blood obtained from the volunteers, it was found that erythrocytes bound significant amounts of AIgG, suggesting that CR 1 on erythrocytes is involved in the clearance of complement activating immune complexes in humans. In five of the volunteers, clearance studies with EIgG had been done in a previous study. EIgG was cleared from the circulation with a t 1 / 2 of 30 +/- 6. 2 min (mean +/- SD).

Pentraxins labeled with '"I-TC showed the same in vitro and in vivo ligand binding and the same in vivo plasma to as the directly iodinated proteins and the native unlabeled pentraxins, indicating that their mode of clearance {{was likely to be}} physiological. After intravenous injection into mice and rabbits ofhuman C-reactive protein, human SAP, and mouse SAP, each labeled with '"I-TC, most of the radioactivity remaining in the body at 24 h was located in hepatocytes.
