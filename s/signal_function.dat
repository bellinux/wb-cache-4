40|$|Although most {{developing}} countries monitor {{the proportion of}} births attended by skilled birth attendants (SBA), they lack information on the availability and performance of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by different cadres of health care providers (HCPs). The World Health Organisation <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are set of key interventions that targets direct obstetric causes of maternal deaths. Seven <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are required for health facilities providing basic EmOC and nine for facilities providing comprehensive EmOC. Our objectives were to describe cadres of HCPs who are considered SBAs in Tanzania, the EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> they perform and challenges associated with performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCPs offering maternity care services at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District in northern Tanzania. A questionnaire and health facility assessment forms were used to collect information from participants and health facilities. A total of 199 HCPs working at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District met the inclusion criteria. Out of 199, 158 participated, giving {{a response rate of}} 79. 4 %. Ten cadres of HCPs were identified as conducting deliveries regardless of the level of health facilities. Most of the participants (81 %) considered themselves SBAs, although some were not considered SBAs by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Only two out of the eight facilities provided all of the required EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> While Assistant Medical Officers are expected to perform all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions,</b> only 38 % and 13 % had performed vacuum extraction or caesarean sections respectively. Very few registered and enrolled nurse-midwives had performed removal of retained products (22 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (24 and 11 %). Inadequate equipment and supplies, and lack of knowledge and skills in performing EmOC were two main challenges identified by health care providers in all the level of care. In the district, gaps existed between performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by SBAs as expected by the MOHSW and the actual performance at health facilities. All basic EmOC facilities were not fully functional. Few health care providers performed all the basic EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> Competency-based in-service training of providers in EmOC and provision of enabling environment could improve performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> in the district...|$|R
40|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>functions</b> for {{emergency}} obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) {{are the major}} interventions for averting maternal and neonatal mortalities. Readiness of the facilities is essential to provide all the basic and comprehensive <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC to ensure emergency services from the designated facilities. The study assessed population coverage and availability of EmONC services {{in public and private}} facilities in Bangladesh. An assessment was conducted in all the public and private facilities providing obstetric care in to in-patients 24 districts. Data were collected on the performance of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC from the study facilities {{in the last three months}} prior to the date of assessment. Trained data-collectors interviewed the facility managers and key service providers, along with review of records, using contextualized tools. Population coverage of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was assessed by estimating the number of facilities providing the <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC compared to the United Nations requirements. Availability was assessed in terms of the proportion of facilities providing the services by type of facilities and by district. Caesarean section (CS) delivery and blood transfusion (BT) services (the two major components of comprehensive EmONC) were respectively available in 6. 4 (0. 9 public and 5. 5 private) and 5. 6 (1. 3 public and 4. 3 private) facilities per 500, 000 population. The <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for basic EmONC, except two (parental anticonvulsants and assisted vaginal delivery), were available in a minimum of 5 facilities (public and private sectors combined) per 500, 000 population. A major inter-district variation in the availability of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was observed in each public- and private-sector facility. Among the various types of facilities, only the public medical college hospitals had all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> The situation was poor in other public facilities at the district and sub-district levels as well as in private facilities. In the public sector, CS delivery and BT services were available in the minimum required number of facilities. However, to ensure basic EmONC services, participation of the private sector is necessary. Public-private partnership should be promoted for nationwide coverage of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC in Bangladesh...|$|R

Methods and Findings Key personnel in the Ministries of Health, teaching institutions, referral, regional and district hospitals completed structured questionnaires in nine SSA countries in 2009 – 2011. A total of 21 different cadres of health care providers (HCP) were reported to be SBA. Type and number of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> reported to be provided, varied substantially between cadres and countries.

50|$|Outside {{the realm}} of signal processing, this {{category}} may simply be called rounding or scalar quantization. An ADC can be modeled as two processes: sampling and quantization. Sampling converts a voltage <b>signal</b> (<b>function</b> of time) into a discrete-time signal (sequence of real numbers). Quantization replaces each real number with an approximation from a finite set of discrete values (levels), which is necessary for storage and processing by numerical methods. Most commonly, these discrete values are represented as fixed-point words (either proportional to the waveform values or companded) or floating-point words. Common word-lengths are 8-bit (256 levels), 16-bit (65,536 levels), 32-bit (4.3 billion levels), and so on, though any number of quantization levels is possible (not just powers of two). Quantizing a sequence of numbers produces a sequence of quantization errors which is sometimes modeled as an additive random signal called quantization noise because of its stochastic behavior. The more levels a quantizer uses, the lower is its quantization noise power.|$|E

Each triangular shaped volume is different: individual volumes unfold within the object and expose more and more of the pink inner. The interior of the volume is gold plated with pink 'Traum Gold'. The color pink has a <b>signal</b> <b>function.</b> Literally as John Blankenstein as a referee gave signals with his referee whistle, but also figuratively because of its signal position within the gay rights movement. Behind the object the shadows, through the plexiglas, provide a changing, free view of the object. The gay rights movement is in motion.

50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp home mode functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed <b>signal</b> <b>function</b> for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|E
