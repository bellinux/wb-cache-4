30|$|For our PAL measurements, the DRC Charisma® samples (in A 3 shadow) were {{prepared}} by filling an inner volume of disk-shaped plastic molds of uniform size having 6  mm {{in diameter and}} 2  mm in thickness. Bottom-end surface of plastic disk was covered by polyethylene <b>slice</b> <b>film,</b> separated from DRC sample along with around-disk outer ring just before PAL experiments. This batch of non-polymerized (uncured) DRC samples of character paste-like consistency was marked as Charisma- 0. Part of these DRC samples were then polymerized by illuminating their upper surfaces with standard curing dental wireless LED source (LED.T 4, SEASKY, China) emitted light irradiation in 420 – 480  nm range with ~ 900  mW/cm 2 output power density. To normalize the light-curing protocol, {{the end of the}} guide tip from light source was maintained just above the sample surface at a distance of 7  mm, so sample’s surface was fully covered by light beam. The light illumination durations were 5, 20, and 60  s, the latter exposure ensuring deeply polymerized DRC Charisma® state (in respect to the manufacturers’ manual [4, 5]). The light-cured DRC samples marked as Charisma- 1, 2, 3 for different curing durations (5, 20, and 60  s, respectively) were then stored dry at room temperature for 3  days before PAL measurements.|$|R

5000|$|Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, {{but later}} models, {{starting}} with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat Through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid-1960s. Most controls—including the shutter release and the film wind lever - are on the left-hand side, unlike most other cameras. The film is transported {{in the opposite direction}} to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas—made between 1936 and 1969—two film canisters can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built {{into the bottom of the}} camera can be used to <b>slice</b> the <b>film</b> so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister.

40|$|Hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposites con- taining hyperbranched {{structures}} were prepared through a dual-curing process, which involves photopolymerization and condensation alkoxysilane groups. In particular, an oligomer containing PEO units and a,v-methacrylate groups was used {{together with a}} HBP bearing acrylic groups as the organic phase precursors. MEMO, as the organic-inorganic linker, and TEOS, as inorganic phase precursor, were also employed. The kinetics of both photopolymerization and condensation reactions were investigated by double bond conversion analysis (via FT-IR) and weight loss determi- nation, respectively. The mobility of the organic phase was studied by means of DSC and DMTA and correlated with hybrid composition. TEM analyses performed on micro- tomed <b>film</b> <b>slices</b> indicated the formation of nanoscale silica domains. Hybrids were coated onto an LDPE film previously subjected to a plasma treatment, and substrate-coating inter- facial adhesion was investigated through stress-strain and DMTA experiment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Superficial fascia of the abdomen, being a {{supportive}} structure plays {{a vital role}} in abdominal localized fat deposits (LFDs) as well as in surgical treatment of obesity. Interest in the anatomy of the superficial fascia is increasing with increasing popularity of surgical procedures for abdominal obesity. The study aims at computed tomographic evaluation and classification of the superficial fascia of abdomen & comparing with the earlier published cadaveric study. Materials and methods: One hundred two 64 <b>slice</b> CT scans <b>films</b> of abdominal region of 102 subjects showing radiologically normal abdominal fat of either sex (64 males 38 females) between 25 to 70 year age were analyzed. Results: Superficial fascia of the abdomen was multilayered in the midline & gradually merged with each other laterally. Multiple layers of superficial fascia in form of multiple loculi were seen mainly over central abdomen and loin region. Conclusion: Multiple layers of superficial fascia in the form of multiple loculi {{may be one of the}} reasons for resistant nature of LFD areas like loin and central abdomen...|$|R
50|$|Mohun Bagan {{had entered}} the finals after having vanquished strong teams of the British side such as Rangers, St. Xaviers and Middlesex which {{consolidated}} the team’s confidence that the British teams were not as unconquerable as they thought. East Yorkshire Regiment scored one goal before half-time sending the entire audience into a tizzy and depressing the home team. But after half-time, the team scored two goals one by Captain Sibdas Bhaduri and the other by Abhilash Ghosh, a striker. The preparation towards the final match spans a major <b>slice</b> of the <b>film</b> including family and personal hurdles the team members face. Abhilash is a student at Scottish Church College, along with teammate Rajen Sengupta. Abhilash’s father does not care about his brilliant son’s involvement {{in a game that}} might anger the British rulers. Abhilash himself begins to rethink his stance because football, he feels, has reduced his duties towards those he loves. Sudhir Chatterjee, professor in the London Missionary Society College is insulted in the staff room by his British colleagues for daring to participate in a match against a British team. The Principal suspends him indefinitely. But Shibdas is determined to win even if {{one or two of the}} team drop out at the last minute. They don't.|$|R
500|$|Leonard Maltin {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, {{describing}} it a [...] "weird, almost incoherent crime story." [...] Celluloid Dream's Simon Hill commented that the writing was a disappointment, musing that it did however feature [...] "glimpses of director Raimi would become". A scene in a dentist office reminded him of a scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators. Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no matter how you <b>slice</b> it, the <b>film</b> was a dog, and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and our studio refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|R
40|$|Polycrystalline diamond layers, {{deposited}} from chemical vapours {{that have}} had impurities introduced during the growth process have been studied to observe any effects on the samples morphology or defect type and concentration. Three differently doped diamond films were studied, with added boron, oxygen and deuterium. The main area of research was based around {{the study of the}} intrinsic and impurity related defects created by electron irradiation and studied by low temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy. Electrons with energies between 200 KeV and 300 KeV were used to irradiate the diamond films over an area of 50 #mu#m diameter. The doses received ranged from 2. 26 x 10 " 1 " 9 to 4. 45 x 10 " 2 " 0 el/cm" 2. In particular, using low voltage irradiations (200 KeV) on the boron-doped CVD diamond films, centres with zero phonon lines at 636 nm, 648 nm and 666 nm have been identified as being related to boron incorporation. No photoluminescence centres have been found that coincide with hydrogen or oxygen incorporation. With the use of a new sample preparation technique, involving the laser <b>slicing</b> of diamond <b>films</b> to produce cross-sectional wedges, transmission electron microscopy observations were made and related to the photoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy observations made on the same samples. The new method allowed the sample preparation to become more accessible and as a result observation work across the entire width of a sample became possible. This enabled a clear image of the change in grain structure, type and concentration of defects to be observed from the initial nucleation side to the final growth layer. Through this work defects were observed that run orthogonal to the grain boundaries and generally appeared to emanate from them.
