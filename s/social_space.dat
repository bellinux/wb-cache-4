40|$|The {{transfer}} of cultural capital across borders {{is a common}} topic in transnational sociology. While the majority of studies investigates the opportunities and challenges of adult migrants and their social mobility in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces,</b> children in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> are predominantly acknowledged either as indicators for their migrant population's mobility rates or as 'left-behinds'. While the first branch of literature investigates migrant population only {{in relation to the}} immigration country, the other does argue from a transnational perspective yet the ramifications and challenges of co-present parent-child relations in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> are an understudied topic. This article aims to raise awareness that the ways migrants raise their children in transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> is a crucial site to study the broader topic of the modes of the (re-) production of transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> This is so because the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital is the main mechanism operating in the reproduction of unequal social structures and therefore also of transnational <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> Based on twenty semi-structured interviews with migrants from Poland in Germany, this article sheds light on migrant parents' childrearing orientations in relation to language and education. The article reveals that despite fairly similar orientations, parents have, dependent on their cultural capital, very different opportunities to fulfill their parenting needs...|$|R

40|$|In the German {{tradition}} {{of social work}} 1, the idea of <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> (Sozialräume) became a significant conceptual reference since the early 1990 s. Starting with the seminal work “Pädagogik des Jugendraums” by Böhnisch/Münchmeier (1990) a variety of approaches based {{on the concept of}} <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> were developed in social work debates around theory and practice. Meanwhile, after some years of discussion the idea of a “social space orientation ” (Sozialraumorientierung) can meanwhile be regarded a paradigm in social work in Germany (Spatscheck 2009). The discourse within social work currently follows two different understandings of <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> One group of researchers regards <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> as fields for processes of acquirement, learning and active participation for local inhabitants and began to develop concepts around youth work, social development {{and a variety of other}} different fields of social work (Deinet 2009).

As a result, UC San Diego suffered from reduced student involvement {{and a sense of}} apathy across campus. Additionally, the lack of on-campus <b>social</b> <b>space</b> contributed to the fact that nearly 60% of UCSD students at the time commuted to school. In November 1983, a survey of 2,000 UCSD students indicated a pressing need for a new student union. That same school year, students passed a referendum that raised their student fees from $12.50 per quarter to $37.50 per quarter, for the purpose of constructing a University Center that would house fast food restaurants, a movie theater, and offices for student organizations. The proposed University Center, sited southeast of the existing Central Library, was originally estimated to cost $9 million to construct, but the Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz design approved by the UC Regents would be an $18.6 million facility with an added pub, ballroom, and bookstore.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the <b>social</b> <b>space.</b> By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
25|$|The void which {{cuts through}} the entire height of the building, and this was {{intentionally}} done by the architect to visually connect {{the upper and lower}} spaces. This longitudinal void opens to a rooftop skylight, bringing in natural daylight into the atrium below. The typical dependence of artificial lighting for a building of this size would typically account for more than 13% of its electricity use. However, with the installation of this void, a great portion of that cost is reduced. This spatial device was intended as a sustainable element of the design, as seen in many of Foster’s projects, it is an effective solution to reducing electricity consumption which is vital to a structure of this scale. The most important aspect that this vertical void contributes to the building is that is creates a distinctive <b>social</b> <b>space</b> for its users. Norman Foster has been experimenting and studying with the reconfiguration of spaces and the natural lighting conditions to redefine institutions. This void creates a vast, open, daylight space for the students to gather and relax in between classes. Also, the 23 research laboratories and teaching laboratories are intentionally planned and organized in such a manner where they are fully integrated into other programs- service spaces for faculty members, students and administrators. These programs are connected by bridges which cross the void at the upper floors. As for the pods which are suspended {{in the middle of the}} atrium, these mysterious pods were intentionally designed to give the illusion of defying gravity due to their size and weight. One architectural detail that most be noted, the bottom of the glass-clad cube of the larger volume was specifically designed to line up with the cornices of its adjacent historic buildings. Furthermore, the bottom of the new building will be transparent so that the older buildings will be visible through the lobby, says David Nelson of Foster and Partners.|$|E

40|$|Since recent years, {{the issue}} of social {{sustainability}} in urban high-rise housing developments {{has become one of}} the major concerns in the field of urban studies, psychology and architecture. The failure to address the social sustainability in dense living conditions not only causes negative emotions in the individual; but the lack of social sustainability has caused a social deficit in the urban community. This social issue has resulted in living conditions that mimic living in pigeon holes. Eventually, this phenomenon could lead to the formation of a generation conditioned to isolation. Hence, the purpose of this dissertation is to identify strategies to promote social interactions in urban high-rise housing. This study is conducted through literature review of other related studies, and by conducting a critical analysis of architectural solutions that contribute in enhancing social sustainability in high rise residences. Several studies have shown the inclusion of <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> in high-rise housing could improve social sustainability in community living. However, the success of this inclusion does not only depend on the layout design of <b>social</b> <b>spaces.</b> It also involves the sense of belonging to a home boundary based on the social setting. A field observation of a squatter settlement in Kampung Pengkalan Rinting, Tampoi, Johor Bahru was conducted to identify the sense of belonging that is based on social settings. The study has shown that the design of transitional spaces near the dwelling?s doorstep has positive contributions to the social setting of the community such as in providing a social platform for interaction with neighbours. Beside this, the maintenance of <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> and community strategies are one of the deciding concerns for the success of <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> included in high-rise residences. At the end of this study, a set of architectural-based guidelines is proposed that are supported by relevant arguments for the inclusion of <b>social</b> <b>spaces</b> in high-rise dwelling...|$|R
