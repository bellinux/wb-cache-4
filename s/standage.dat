These shows were later to also influence Charles Babbage in his invention of the difference engine.|$|E

"The 34-Ton Bat"-named for the enormous, 120-foot-tall bat that {{leans against}} the Louisville Slugger Museum in Louisville, Ky.-is full of bits of {{information}} that will give even the most knowledgeable fan {{a new understanding of}} the game and of those who have played it. 'Material culture' is the academic term for the study of physical objects as a means of getting at larger truths and understanding historical turning points. It is exactly what anthropologists and archaeologists have long done, as they coax conclusions from shards of pottery and projectile points. In recent years, popular authors have taken a page from this playbook and given us, among other titles, Neil MacGregor's [...] "A History of the World in 100 Objects," [...] Harold Holzer's [...] "The Civil War in 50 Objects" [...] and Tom <b>Standage's</b> [...] "A History of the World in 6 Glasses." [...] Now veteran Sports Illustrated writer and columnist Steve Rushin has applied this notion to baseball by rummaging through the attic of the national pastime and telling its story through objects as central as the bat and ball and even humbler elements-including the primitive steel cups fashioned to protect the [...] "family jewels" [...] and ballpark urinals, a necessity made all the more urgent because of the oceans of beer consumed at ballparks." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{result of}} the {{challenge}} was the Automaton Chess-player, known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes, and dressed in Ottoman robes and a turban – [...] "the traditional costume", according to journalist and author Tom <b>Standage,</b> [...] "of an oriental sorcerer". Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay {{on the top of}} a large cabinet that measured about three-and-a-half feet (110cm) long, two feet (60cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white ivory chess set.|$|E
