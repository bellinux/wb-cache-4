40|$|AbstractDetailed {{knowledge}} of the lateral distribution of steam (void) and water in a nuclear fuel assembly is of great value for nuclear reactor operators and fuel manufacturers, with consequences for both reactor safety and economy of operation. Therefore, nuclear relevant two-phase flows are being studied at dedicated thermal-hydraulic test loop, using two-phase flow systems ranging from simplified geometries such as heated circular pipes to full scale mock-ups of nuclear fuel assemblies. Neutron tomography (NT) has been suggested for assessment of the lateral distribution of steam and water in such test loops, motivated by a good ability of neutrons to penetrate the metallic structures of metal pipes and nuclear fuel rod mock-ups, as compared to e. g. conventional X-rays, while the liquid water simultaneously gives comparatively good contrast. However, these stationary test loops require the measurement setup to be mobile, which is often {{not the case for}} NT setups. Here, it is acknowledged that fast neutrons of 14 MeV from mobile neutron generators constitute a viable option for a mobile NT system. We present details of the development of neutron tomography for this purpose at the division of Applied Nuclear Physics at Uppsala University. Our concept contains a portable neutron generator, exploiting the fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium, and a detector with plastic scintillator elements designed to achieveadequate spatial and energy resolution, all mounted in a light-weight frame without collimators or bulky moderation to allow for a mobile instrument that can be moved about the <b>stationary</b> thermal <b>hydraulic</b> test sections. The detector system stores event-to-event pulse-height information to allow for discrimination based on the energy deposition in the scintillator elements. Experimentalresultsfrom the tomographic assessment of axially symmetric test objectsare shown, as well as simulation results from a scaled up version of the instrument for nonsymmetrical objects in quarter fuel-bundle size objects. In conclusion, the application of tomography on inch-wide vertical pipes has been experimentally demonstrated and simulation results indicate that tomography of the void distribution in nonsymmetrical vertical flows in quarter BWR fuel bundles is also feasible...|$|R

40|$|Experiments on {{characterization}} of thin liquid films flowing over stationary and rotating disk surfaces are described. The thin liquid film {{was created by}} introducing deionized water from a flow collar {{at the center of}} an aluminum disk with a known initial film thickness and uniform radial velocity. Radial film thickness distribution was measured using a non-intrusive laser light interface reflection technique that enabled the measurement of the instantaneous film thickness over a finite segment of the disk. Experiments were performed for a range of flow rates between 3. 01 pm and 15. 01 pm, corresponding to Reynolds numbers based on the liquid inlet gap height and velocity between 238 and 1, 188. The angular speed of the disk was varied from 0 rpm to 300 rpm. When the disk was <b>stationary,</b> a circular <b>hydraulic</b> jump was present in the liquid film. The liquid-film thickness in the subcritical region (down-stream of the hydraulic jump) was an order of magnitude greater than that in the supercritical region (upstream of the hydraulic jump) which was of the order of 0. 3 mm. As the Reynolds number increased, the hydraulic jump migrated {{toward the edge of the}} disk. In the case of rotation, the liquid-film thickness exhibited a maximum on the disk surface. The liquid-film inertia and friction influenced the inner region where the film thickness progressively increased. The outer region where the film thickness decreased was primarily affected by the centrifugal forces. A flow visualization study of the thin film was also performed to determine the characteristics of the waves on the free surface. At high rotational speeds, spiral waves were observed on the liquid film. It was also determined that the angle of the waves which form on the liquid surface was a function of the ratio of local radial to tangential velocity...|$|R

40|$|Wave and {{transport}} phenomena through porous media are {{of great importance}} in science and industrial applications, because they involve the interaction of various physical mechanisms and can provide useful informations {{of the structure of}} the porous medium. Despite the extensive application in modern industry and comprehensive research, transport and wave propagation through porous materials are not fully understood. This work focuses on the investigations of hydraulical and acoustical properties of sintered glass bead systems, which serve as replacement for rock samples. In contrast to common rock samples the hydraulical and acoustical properties of the sintered glass bead samples can be selectively influenced by the selection of certain glass beads and sintering treatments. Moreover, their high gray-scale contrast to the pore space, in addition to the relatively simple pore structure favors their use in scientific research and image analysis. The research goal is to understand the essential physical phenomena and mechanisms, which determine the transport and wave behavior in fluid-saturated porous sintered glass bead systems. For this purpose, a multi-purpose measuring cell is developed, which enables, besides stationary and dynamic permeability measurements, also to perform ultrasound experiments, while the produced porous sintered samples can be saturated with different fluids. The steady-state and oscillatory flow processes through sintered glass bead packings, are investigated, in order to determine both, the <b>stationary</b> and frequency-dependent <b>hydraulic</b> properties. For the ultrasound experiments the porous sintered samples are either saturated with Newtonian fluids, like water or silicone oil, or with magnetorheological fluids (MRF), which is a suspension of micron-sized, magnetizable particles in a silicone-oil-based carrying fluid. The wave propagation in MRFsaturated porous sintered samples is studied at different magnetization strengths. The ultrasound experiments are performed according to the transmission method and analyzed using the spectral ratio technique. The ultrasound experiments reveal nicely the dispersive nature of the fluid-saturated sintered granular materials and show strong frequency filtering as the dispersion properties of the detected waves are highly influenced by the pore fluid. The experimental studies of transport and waves are complemented by extensive research on the morphology by using XRCT-based images of the produced samples. A special focus lies on the elaborate μXRCT data processing of the produced samples. The proposed frameworks for μXRCT analysis can be used for arbitrary porous media. The binarized and differently-sized voxel data are incorporated in Lattice Boltzmann simulations to determine the local permeabilities numerically and finally are compared with experimental effective permeabilities. The numerical permeabilities are correlated with averaged microscopic features, such as pore throats...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{is employed}} {{to study the}} dynamics over hypothetical urban areas in neutrally and stably stratified turbulent boundary layers. In neutral stratification, a total of 144 two-dimensional computational domains (18 different building-height-to-street-width (aspect) ratios with 8 distinct roof geometries) {{were used in the}} numerical simulations. In stable stratification, six three-dimensional computational domains with different stratifications (Froude number = 1. 7, 2. 4, 2. 8, 3. 1, 4. 0 and 4. 6) were used for the investigation of dynamics in interfacial flows with <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump by the single layer hydraulic model. Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Strokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) coupled with Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method were used in the numerical simulation of neutrally and stably stratified flows respectively. 	Friction factor (f) was proposed as a parameter to quantify the aerodynamic resistance over idealized urban geometries. Air change rate (ACH) and pollutant change rate (PCH) were suggested to appraise ventilation and pollutant removal at the roof level of street canyons in neutrally stratified turbulent boundary layer respectively. The fluctuation component of ACH was found to be directly proportional to f^(1 ⁄ 2) and PCH was found to behave distinctively in different flow regimes. Both fluctuation components of ACH and PCH dominated the ventilation and pollutant removal mechanism that could serve as the minimum performance indices. The vertical dispersion coefficient σ_z, which is a parameter commonly used in Gaussian plume model, was used to describe the dispersion characteristics after a pollutant line source placed at the street level. It was found that σ_z was directly proportional to f^(1 ⁄ 4) and the frictional force exerted by rough surfaces was able to alter the near-field and far-field behaviors of pollutant dispersion. 	Three different flow regimes, namely submerged hydraulic jump, <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump and supercritical hydraulic jump were identified in stably stratified turbulent boundary layer modeled by the single layer hydraulic model. The dynamics were found completely different in each regime that must be analyzed separately. Detailed comparisons of vertical profiles and ventilation performance were reported for the flows in <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump and supercritical hydraulic jump regime. Flows in <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump regime were selected for in-depth analysis with different stratifications. It was found that the total ACH remained constant regardless the variation in flow stratification. Furthermore, the fluctuation and mean components of ACH increased and decreased with increasing stability respectively. This finding is quite different from our conventional understanding of the suppressed turbulence in strong stratification. Finally, the coherent structures of flow in stably stratified turbulent boundary layer with <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump were closely inspected. A secondary turbulence production mechanism was found in the more stable stratification flows. The turbulence generated in higher stability also dissipated slower and traveled further.

40|$|In an open channel, {{a sudden}} rise in water level induces a {{positive}} surge, or bore, that may develop as a hydraulic jump in translation. When the surge propagates against an adverse slope, it decelerates {{until it becomes}} a <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump. Both hydraulic jumps and decelerating surges induce some intense turbulent mixing and have some major impact on the sediment transport in natural systems. Herein, a physical investigation was conducted in a relatively large rectangular channel. Hydraulic jumps and surges were generated by the rapid closure of a gate at the channel downstream end. The turbulent shear stresses were measured with high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz sampling rate) in the jump flow. A comparison between the <b>stationary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> jump, hydraulic jump in translation and decelerating surge measurements showed some marked differences in terms of turbulent mixing. The results highlighted some intense mixing beneath the jump front and roller for all configurations. The levels of turbulent stresses were one to two orders of magnitude larger than a critical threshold for sediment motion. The findings provide some insights into the hydraulic jump migration processes in mobile bed channels, and the complex transformation from a moving jump into a stationary jump.
