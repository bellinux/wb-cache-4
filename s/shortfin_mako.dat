5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{longfin mako}} has large eyes and is {{attracted}} to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying {{that it is}} a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a 3.4-m-long female with the broken bill from a swordfish (Xiphius gladias) lodged in her abdomen was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on swordfish as the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> does, or encountered the swordfish in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and <b>shortfin</b> <b>makos</b> has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|R
40|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>makos</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus) are a high-value bycatch of pelagic {{longline}} fisheries off the eastern coast of Canada. Annual catches in Canadian waters average 60 - 80 mt per year. Therefore, Canadian catches represent {{but a small}} part of that for the North Atlantic population as a whole. A standardized catch rate series was developed based on observed foreign tuna fleets fishing within Canadian waters and the Canadian swordfish fleet. There was no consistent trend in abundance since 1996 based on the standardized catch rate analysis. SCRS/ 2008 / 14...|$|R
5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, <b>shortfin</b> and longfin <b>mako</b> sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|R
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{scattered}} records {{suggest that}} the longfin mako shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceans; the extent of its range {{is difficult to determine}} due to confusion with the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b> In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Gulf Stream off the east coast of the United States, Cuba, and southern Brazil in the west, and from the Iberian Peninsula to Ghana in the east, possibly including the Mediterranean Sea and Cape Verde. In the Indian Ocean, it has been reported from the Mozambique Channel. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan and Taiwan, northeastern Australia, a number of islands in the Central Pacific northeast of Micronesia, and southern California.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{population}} structure, reproductive biology, age and growth, {{and diet}} of <b>shortfin</b> <b>makos</b> caught by pelagic longliners (2005 – 10) and bather protection nets (1978 – 2010) in the south-west Indian Ocean were investigated. Themean fork length (FL) of makos measured by observers on longliners targeting tuna, swordfish and sharks was similar, and decreased {{from east to}} west, with the smallest individuals occurring near the Agulhas Bank edge, June to November. Nearly all makos caught by longliners were immature, with equal sex ratio. Makos caught by bather protection nets were significantly larger, males weremore frequent, and 93 %ofmales and 55 %of females weremature. Agewas assessed from band counts of sectioned vertebrae, and a von Bertalanffy growthmodel fitted to sex-pooled length-at-age data predicted a birth size (L 0) of 90 cm, maximum FL (LN) of 285 cm and growth coefficient (k) of 0. 113 y 1. Males matured at 190 cm FL, aged 7 years, and females at 250 cm, aged 15 years. Litter sizes ranged from nine to 14 pups, {{and the presence of}} gravid females in bather protection nets suggested that some pupping occurred in shelf waters. Teleosts (mainly Trachurus capensis) occurred in 84 % of stomachs collected on longliners, whereas elasmobranchs (63. 5 %) were most common in samples collected from bather protection nets, followed by teleosts (43. 1 %) and cephalopods (36. 5 %).

40|$|Horizontal {{behavior}} of highly migratory marine species {{is difficult to}} decipher because animals are wide-ranging, spend minimal time at the ocean surface, and utilize remote habitats. Satellite telemetry enables researchers to track individual movements, but population level inferences are rare due to data limitations that result from difficulty of capture and sporadic tag reporting. We introduce a Bayesian modeling framework to address population level questions with satellite telemetry data when data are sparse. We also outline an approach for identifying informative variables for use within the model. We tested our modeling approach using a large telemetry dataset for <b>Shortfin</b> <b>Makos</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus), which allowed us to assess the effects of various degrees of data paucity. First, a permuted Random Forest analysis is implemented to determine which variables are most informative. Next, a generalized additive mixed model is used to help define the relationship of each remaining variable with the response variable. Using jags and rjags {{for the analysis of}} Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we then developed a movement model to generate parameter estimates for each of the variables of interest. By randomly reducing the tagging dataset by 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent and recalculating the parameter estimates, we demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian approach can be applied in data-limited situations. We also demonstrate how two commonly used linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be similarly applied. Additionally, we simulate data from known parameter values to test each model's ability to recapture those values. Despite performing similarly, we advocate using the Bayesian over the MLE approach due to the ability for later studies to easily utilize results of past study to inform working models, and the ability to use prior knowledge via informed priors in systems where such information is available...|$|R
500|$|Among {{the most}} ancient and {{primitive}} sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about [...] long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws. Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From {{the small number of}} teeth found together, it is most likely that Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic <b>shortfin</b> and longfin <b>makos.</b> The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four species responsible for {{a significant number of}} fatal attacks on humans, a number of other species have attacked humans without being provoked, and have on extremely rare occasions been responsible for a human death. This group includes the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> hammerhead, Galapagos, gray reef, blacktip, lemon, silky shark and blue sharks. These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply by being in the water at the wrong time and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.|$|E
500|$|The {{longfin mako}} shark (Isurus paucus) is {{a species of}} {{mackerel}} shark in the family Lamnidae, with a probable worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical waters. An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name [...] "mako" [...] with its better-known relative, the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported {{to a depth of}} [...] Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{biology of}} the longfin mako is little-known; it is {{somewhat}} common in the western Atlantic and possibly the central Pacific, while in the eastern Atlantic, it is rare and outnumbered over 1000-fold by the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> in fishery landings. The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the blue shark (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This morphological similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> {{one of the fastest}} and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses blood vessel countercurrent exchange systems called the rete mirabilia (Latin for [...] "wonderful net", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other mackerel sharks to conserve metabolic heat and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|In general, sharks swim ("cruise") at {{an average}} speed of , but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach speeds upwards of [...] The <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark, the fastest shark {{and one of the}} fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to [...] The great white shark is also capable of speed bursts. These {{exceptions}} {{may be due to the}} warm-blooded, or homeothermic, nature of these sharks' physiology. Sharks can travel 70 to 80km in a day.|$|E
500|$|At one time, {{porbeagles}} {{were regarded}} as nuisances by some commercial fishers because they damaged lighter fishing gear intended for smaller species and stole hooked fish from lines. This shark is highly valued as a game fish by sport fishers in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It fights strongly on hook-and-line, but does not usually jump into the air like the related <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b> Novice anglers often mistake this shark for the mako, which has earned it the affectionate moniker [...] "fako" [...] in New England. The International Game Fish Association keeps records on the porbeagle.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the longfin mako was published in 1966 by Cuban marine scientist Darío Guitart-Manday, in the scientific journal Poeyana, based on three adult specimens from the Caribbean Sea. An earlier synonym of this species may be Lamiostoma belyaevi, described by Glückman in 1964. However, the type specimen designated by Glückman consists {{of a set of}} fossil teeth that could not be confirmed as belonging to the longfin mako, thus the name paucus took precedence over belyaevi despite being published later. The specific epithet paucus is Latin for [...] "few", referring to the rarity of this species relative to the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} [...] "cold-blooded" [...] or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their {{internal}} body temperature matches {{that of their}} ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located {{near the center of}} the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile ("miraculous net"). The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E
500|$|Common {{threshers}} {{are well}} regarded by sports fishers {{as one of}} the strongest fighting sharks alongside the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark (Isurus oxyrhinchus), and are ranked as game fish by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA). They are pursued by anglers using rod and reel off California, South Africa, and elsewhere. Frank Mundus has called thresher sharks [...] "exceedingly stubborn" [...] and [...] "pound for pound, a harder fish to whip" [...] than the mako. Fishing for the common thresher is similar to that for the mako; the recommended equipment is a [...] rod and a big-game reel holding at least 365 m (400 yd) of [...] line. The ideal method is trolling with baitfish, either deep or allowing it to drift.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{has very}} rarely, if ever, bitten swimmers or boats. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File attributes three bites to this species, one provoked and none fatal, and two on boats. One older anecdote {{tells of a}} fisherman who provoked a porbeagle into leaping from the water and tearing his clothes. In another account of a swimmer bitten by a [...] "mackerel shark", the species responsible {{could easily have been}} a misidentified <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> or great white shark. Recently in the North Sea, adult porbeagles have been filmed charging at divers working on oil platforms, sometimes even brushing lightly against them without doing harm. These rushes do not appear to have predatory intent and may instead be motivated by curiosity or defense.|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} {{mackerel}} sharks, the longfin mako is aplacental viviparous and typically {{gives birth to}} two pups at a time (one inside each uterus), though a 3.3-m-long female pregnant with eight well-developed embryos {{was caught in the}} Mona Passage near Puerto Rico in January 1983. The developing embryos are oophagous; once they deplete their supply of yolk, they sustain themselves by consuming large quantities of nonviable eggs ovulated by their mother. No evidence of sibling cannibalism is seen as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). The pups measure [...] long at birth, relatively larger than the young of the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> and have proportionally longer heads and pectoral fins than the adults. Capture records off Florida suggest that during the winter, females swim into shallow coastal waters to give birth. Male and female sharks reach sexual maturity at lengths around [...] and , respectively.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries, and those sharks occasionally enter Tokyo markets. From 1987 to 1994, United States fisheries reported catches (discarded, as this species is worthless on the North American market) of 2–12 tons per year. Since 1999, retention {{of this species}} has been prohibited by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service [...] Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sharks. Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery, comprising a sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972; more recent data from this fishery are not available. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable due to its uncommonness, low reproductive rate, and susceptibility to shark fishing gear. It has also been listed under Annex I of the Convention on Migratory Species Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. In the North Atlantic, stocks of the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> have declined 40% or more since the late 1980s, and concerns exist that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend.|$|E
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks, as {{with most}} other sharks, are aged by {{sectioning}} vertebrae — {{one of the few}} bony structures in sharks — and counting growth bands. The age of <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4-6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens.

50|$|The <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark is {{a fairly}} large species of shark. An average adult {{specimen}} measures around 3.2 m in length and weigh from 60 - 135 kg. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females typically larger than males. The largest <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark taken on hook-and-line was 600 kg, caught {{off the coast of}} California on June 3, 2013. Larger specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of 3.8 m and a weight of 570 kg. The longest verified length for a <b>Shortfin</b> <b>Mako,</b> caught off of the coast of France in September 1973, was 4.45 m. A specimen caught off the coast of Italy and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary 1000 kg at a length of 4 m.

50|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks over 3 m have {{interior}} teeth considerably {{wider and}} flatter than smaller makos, which {{enables them to}} prey effectively upon dolphins, swordfish, and other sharks. An amateur videotape, taken in Pacific waters, shows a moribund pantropical spotted dolphin whose tail was almost completely severed being circled by a <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b> Makos also tend to scavenge long-lined and netted fish.Its endothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed.|$|E
