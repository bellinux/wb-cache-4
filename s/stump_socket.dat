40|$|This study {{examined}} the interface pressure differences at the <b>stump</b> <b>socket</b> between an ICRC polypropylene socket and an air splint socket for a common wearer of transhumeral amputee using F-socket transducers. Two F-socket sensors arrays were attached to the residual limb. The subject was {{asked to complete the}} following tasks: Normal position, stand in a normal position without conducting any motion and shoulder movements, flexion/extension and abduction. The results revealed that the interface pressure applied using ICRC polypropylene socket was maximize at the end distal of the residual limb and give more pressure contact to any shoulder movements. Conversely, while using air splint socket, the socket was able to auto-adjust for required socket fitting even for any change while doing shoulder movements. Our result demonstrated how the comparison of pressure applied at the <b>stump</b> <b>socket</b> may lead in chosen the suitable prosthetic's socket for the amputee. The impending development of an auto adjusted socket that uses an air splint system will provide the prosthetic socket with a less contact pressure at the residual limb.

50|$|One {{problem with}} the <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> {{attachment}} is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> or liner, and increase pockets between <b>stump</b> skin and <b>socket</b> or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Over time, {{this can lead to}} breakdown of the skin.|$|R

40|$|At an {{increasing}} rate modern supply concepts for above-knee amputees refer to biomechanical gait aspects and therefore dynamic processes during gait. It {{is not sufficient}} anymore to only monitor the stump and generate a prosthesis socket under static conditions. To better adjust prosthesis sockets {{to the needs of}} the user not only the anatomical conditions but also knowledge about the interaction of <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> is mandatory.

5000|$|The <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> method {{can cause}} {{significant}} {{pain in the}} amputee, {{which is why the}} direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone {{at the end of the}} stump. After several months the bone attaches itself to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following: ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Present {{models in}} the literature, {{predicting}} that prostheses should not be too lightweight, are not supported by empirical evidence. Recent studies suggest that these models are incorrectly {{based on the assumption}} that the swing phase is uninfluenced by muscle activity. The purpose of the present study was to introduce a new mathematical model to predict the effect of mass properties on the gait of transtibial amputees, based on experimental findings that subjects adapt to mass perturbations by maintaining the same joint kinematics. Method: Effect of mass perturbations on the lower leg was evaluated in terms of muscular cost and forces between <b>stump</b> and <b>socket,</b> using a linked-segment model of the swing phase. Gait analysis and anthropometric data from 10 transtibial amputees were used as model input. Results: Location of perturbation strongly influenced the muscular cost. Cost generally increased after distally adding mass but decreased after proximally adding mass to the lower leg. <b>Stump</b> - <b>socket</b> interface forces always increased after mass addition. Conclusions: A new model was introduced, predicting that the weight of distally located components (e. g. foot, ankle, shoe) strongly influence the estimated muscular cost, in contrast to proximal components. A comparison with experimental literature suggests this new model better describes the experimental data than existing models. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Osseointegrated Prosthetic Limb (OPL) was {{introduced}} in 2011. Prior to its advent all prostheses consisted of <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> mechanisms which did not changed dramatically since Ambroise Pare lower limb prosthesis in 1525. These socket prostheses failed to address a few major requirements of normal gait. Our hypothesis was that using an Osseointegrated Prosthetic limb will result in superior function of daily activities, without compromising patients’ safety.

40|$|A good-fitting {{prosthetic}} socket {{requires the}} pressure between the <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> {{to be distributed}} to ensure the load is carried by pressure tolerant regions of the limb. Transducers and Finite Element Analysis have been utilised to measure and monitor these pressures. However, it has been recognised that both techniques have limitations, making them impractical for everyday clinical use to aid the prosthetist in the socket fitting process. This paper details {{the design of a}} Hybrid Inverse Problem Engine (HIPE) which combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and experimental/numerical data to create a less invasive and passive approach to develop a practical clinical tool for predicting the pressure distribution at the limb/socket interface. Testing and validation of the HIPE under laboratory conditions showed that the technique was able to predict the location and magnitude of pressures applied manually to the socket. A comparison of the predicted pressure distribution found using the HIPE, at the limb/socket interface of a patient in a clinical environment with photoelastic data of the actual pressure distribution, further indicated the technique’s potential benefits. It is hoped that the HIPE will eventually become a general tool suitable for monitoring the fit of a prosthesis in a clinical environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} amputation of the lower limb in 11 patients with R A. The reasons for amputation were ischaemia due to peripheral vascular disease; rheumatoid vasculitis; or complications of knee arthroplasty. Delayed heal-ing was common in patients on steroid therapy. The patients had difficulty donning and doffing their prostheses due to poor hand function and impaired agility. Walking training and rehabilitation were slow and tended to precipitate a generalized flare-up of disease activity. Rheumatoid nodules developed on pressure points between <b>stump</b> and <b>socket.</b> Despite these problems the majority of patients preferred to wear a prosthesis for help in transferring {{in and out of}} the wheelchair, to complete their appearance and for limited mobility. Most found using an electric powered indoor wheel-chair helped maintain their independence. KEY WORDS: Amputation, Rheumatoid arthritis, Stump, Prosthesis, Rehabilitation. AMPUTATION of the lower limb is not often performed in patients with RA, and when it is done the patient rarely achieves useful mobility. The opportunity arose to study 11 such patients through the post-operative phase and their subsequent attempts to learn to walk on artificial limbs. Some guidelines to help these patients retain relative comfort and independence have been formulated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} a {{research}} project that has utilised, for the first time, a Hydro-casting (HC) technique to create a prosthetic socket for a person with trans-femoral amputation. Outcome measurements of the HC socket were compared with a socket and prosthesis produced by conventional ischial containment (IC) technique. Comparisons were based on differences in a) stump-socket interface pressures during gait, b) whole body gait kinetics and kinematics c) femoral movement within the stump tissues relative to the socket during gait. These observations provided {{a snapshot of the}} biomechanical environment of the <b>stump</b> and <b>socket</b> interface and assess the feasibility of using these outcome measurements to highlight differences between the two socket designs. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to use the HC approach to produce a prosthesis that is acceptable to both user and clinician. Results showed similarities between interface pressures, kinetic and kinematic data for both socket designs. The use of ultrasound to detect femoral motion identified that the conventional design paradigm, claiming to stabilise the motion of the femur, may not actually achieve this goal. Additional research is required with larger population of people with a trans-femoral amputation to assess the long term impact of this novel approach...|$|R
40|$|The biomechanical {{interaction}} between the leg stump and the prosthetic socket is critical in achieving close-to-normal ambulation. Although many investigations have been performed to understand the biomechanics of trans-tibial sockets, few studies have measured the socket interface pressure for trans-femoral amputees. Furthermore, no report has examined how the residual muscle activities in the trans-femoral <b>stump</b> affect the <b>socket</b> interface pressure characteristics during gait. In this study, an experimental method was developed to measure the trans-femoral socket interface pressures and EMG of muscles in the stumps of two trans-femoral amputees. Also, the measurement of three-dimensional prosthetic locomotion was synchronized to understand detailed socket biomechanics. Based on the experimental results, a significant correlation (P 5 0. 05) {{was found between the}} measured temporal EMG amplitude and the interface pressure at the knee flexor (biceps femoris) and extensor (rectus femoris). Therefore, the residual muscle activity of a trans-femoral amputee’s stump could be an important factor affecting socket-interface pressure changes during ambulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a pilot study {{investigating}} the effects on the gait of two transfemoral amputees of to {{the inclusion of a}} torque absorber (TA) and its location relative to the knee unit. Both subjects carried out gait tests with a prosthesis with no TA with, a TA proximal to the knee unit and with a TA distal to the knee unit. Three-dimensional gait analysis was carried out to establish the kinematic and kinetic gait parameters of both the prosthetic and sound side. It was found that the TA did not significantly affect the sagittal kinetic and kinematic parameters of the sound or the prosthetic side. However, for one subject the axial rotation of the socket relative to the foot was significantly greater with the TA. It was concluded that by using the methodology of this pilot study, it is possible to investigate the rotations in the transverse plane within the prosthetic limb and pelvis. Further, including a TA may reduce the relative motion between the <b>stump</b> and the <b>socket</b> and therefore may decrease skin breakdown due to diminished shear force...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{developed}} {{in the form of a}} case study to measure the efficiency of gait and conclude if the tested suspension systems differ in the efficiency in a various tested transtibial prostheses,based on the data provided by radiologic images, indirect calorimetry and perception of the patient. Introduction - The suspension system and the stump adjustment to the socket plays an important role in the functionality of the prosthesis, the mobility of the amputee and overall satisfaction with the device. The comfort and functional effectiveness of the prosthesis are closely related. The harmony between the residual limb and prosthesis is crucial to that this meets its function and enable effective March and allow the amputated the continuity of their Daily day activities, keeping the stump functional. Comfort and functional effectiveness of the prosthesis are closely related, suspension systems should prevent excessive longitudinal and rotational transverse displacement of the <b>stump</b> within the <b>socket,</b> these systems should help stabilize and enhance the connection of the prosthesis to the residual limb, reducing the pistonning, increased proprioception and providing a more natural gait...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{problems}} of prescribing a prosthesis {{for a young}} girl with severe congenital vascular malformation deformity leading to a transtibial amputation. Case description and methods: Due to the high risk of recurrent bleeding and limitations regarding full weight bearing of the <b>stump,</b> a normal <b>socket</b> fitting process was not possible. Using a multidisciplinary approach, a prosthesis was designed to enable full weight bearing in a flexed knee position with ischial tuberosity support to prevent full weight bearing on the tibial part of the stump. Findings and outcomes: After training and adjustments to the design, a definitive prosthesis with a free motion mechanical knee joint could be used. During the training with this prosthesis, no skin problems were observed, {{and at the end}} of the rehabilitation, the patient had a high level of activities of daily living and sports. Conclusion: The above prosthetic solution with an adjusted socket design proved to be successful in this case. Clinical relevance In a patient with severe congenital vascular malformation deformity leading to a transtibial amputation, fitting of a good prosthesis without full weight bearing of the stump proved to be successful...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the <b>stump.</b> The custom <b>socket</b> is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|R
40|$|At {{present time}} {{development}} of mathematical models for calculation of a force {{field in the}} "stump-reception socket" system of leg prosthesis of a person becomes a more and more actual direction {{in the field of}} biomechanics and prosthetics. Usage of these models alongside with possibilities of modern computer systems allows operatively, in real time, to calculate and estimate force loading on a stump, purposefully to select parameters of a socket with the purpose of improving its comfort and functionality. The locomotion of the person is modelled by a spatial system of absolute rigid bodies. A surface of a socket of prosthesis is approximated to isosceles trapezoids. An influence of a <b>stump</b> on a <b>socket</b> is changed by a force field {Fi}. It is supposed, that the forces operating within the limits of one trapezoid, are peer among themselves, orthogonal planes of the given trapezoid and are directed outside. A resultant vector of supporting responses of a plane of walking and a point of its application are considered to be given (known from experiments). For a regularization of statically acritical problem the quadratic functional constructed on a hypothesis about uniform distribution of pressure of a <b>socket</b> on a <b>stump</b> is used: &# 1060;=&# 8721;Fi 2 &# 8594;min. For a solution of the formulated problem standard methods of constraint optimization were used. Initial data for modelling were: geometry of prosthesis, weight of units of prosthesis, magnitude and a point of application of a vector of supporting responses. In result the field of the forces influencing on a stump in above-knee prosthesis and below-knee prosthesis was calculated, that has allowed estimating influence of geometrical parameters of prosthesis and a spatial position of prosthesis on character and magnitudes of the pressure originating in the stump-socket system. The obtained outcomes of mathematical modelling have the important value at development of computer systems of the automized estimation of quality of the lower extremities prosthetic management of the person...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of a prosthesis to the residual limb (suspension system) is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing prosthesis to an amputee. Proper fit of the <b>stump</b> inside the <b>socket</b> and appropriate selection of prosthetic suspension positively affect the amputees’ gait, distribution of pressure within the socket, and amputees’ satisfaction. This research aimed to: (1) conduct a survey to compare the effects of seal-in liner and common suction socket (CSS) on transfemoral amputees’ satisfaction; (2) compare the effects of the Seal-In liner (suction) and Dermo liner (Pin/lock) on transtibial amputees’ gait performance; and (3) design and evaluate (mechanical testing, pressure mapping, gait evaluation, and satisfaction survey) a new prosthetic suspension system. The survey study showed that the overall satisfaction increased {{with the use of the}} Seal-In liner compared with the CSS (P 0. 05). Evaluation of kinetic data and subjects’ feedback showed that the participants were more confident to use the suction socket, and the sockets were more suitable for walking. However, the participants expressed more complaints with this system because of difficulty in donning and doffing. Factors influenced by the prosthetic suspension system were derived through an extensive systematic literature review, and a new suspension system (Holo) using Velcro or Hook and Loop concept was designed and fabricated. The universal testing machine was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the designed suspension system. For validation, the Holo was compared with three other common suspension systems, namely, the pin/lock, seal-in, and magnetic suspension system. The maximum tensile load that the new system could iv bear (before failure) was 490 N (SD, 5. 5). However, the pin/lock system could tolerate loading of 580 N (SD, 8. 5). The magnetic (MPSS) and seal-in (suction) could tolerate loads of 350. 9 N (SD, 7. 0) and 310 N (SD, 8. 4), respectively. Comparison (interface pressure) between the pin/lock and the Holo system showed that high pressure was applied to the residual limb at the distal region of the stump by the pin/lock system during ambulation. The new coupling system could distribute the pressure more uniformly over the residual limb. PEQ results indicated that the participants were generally pleased with the new system, particularly with easy donning and doffing procedures. Gait evaluation (case study) demonstrated a slightly higher walking speed and stride length with the new socket with Velcro suspension system than with the pin/lock system. Kinetic results also revealed that the patient were more confident to walk with the Holo system. The Holo suspension system may be used as an alternative suspension system for lower-limb amputees because the biomechanical findings were consistent with the ranges in the literature...|$|R
