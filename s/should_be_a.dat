He used to play bayan and football, but abandoned both during his presidency. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward, who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars.

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas {{was estimated to be}} 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the president <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E
5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious that {{from the very beginning}} Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> collaborative effort amongst the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E

What <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) {{is going to the}} hunting trip with Mark, April offers to give him a hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 37.4g/cm3, which would be the second-highest of any of the 118 known elements, second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium (41g/cm3). In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.|$|E
