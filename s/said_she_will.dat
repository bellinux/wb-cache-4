While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E

During this period, Leung had said she was undecided about pursuing an acting career after Harry Potter and wished to attend university to study art and design. In 2007, she helped The Prince's Trust charity of Scotland raise £100,000 by launching a children's art competition and also donated one of her own paintings which was auctioned for £960. In 2008, she attended University of the Arts London. Leung has expressed a passion for photography. In 2009, she was one of two celebrities who donated a photo to Sightsavers International's I:Click 2009 competition. Sightsavers International is a charitable organisation to combat blindness in poor countries. While appearing in Wild Swans, Leung worked to complete her photography degree.

Then she died, and what her loss was to me--how can I say it?--how could you understand? And after she was taken away and buried, I said: 'She is not dead, and wherever she now is, in heaven or in purgatory, or in the sun, she will remember and come to me and comfort me.' When it was dark I went out alone and sat {{at the end of the}} house, and spent hours waiting for her. 'She will surely come,' I said, 'but I don't know whether I shall see her or not. Perhaps it will be just a whisper in my ear, perhaps a touch of her hand on mine, but I shall know that she is with me.' And at last, worn out with waiting and watching, I went to my bed and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>will</b> come to-morrow. And the next night and the next it was the same. Sometimes I would go up the ladder, always standing against the gable so that one could go up, and standing on the roof, look out over the plain and see where our horses were grazing. There I would sit or lie on the thatch for hours. And I would cry: 'Come to me, my mother! I cannot live without you! Come soon-come soon, before I die of a broken heart!' That was my cry every night, until worn out with my vigil I would go back to my room. And she never came, and at last I knew that she was dead and that we were separated for ever--that there is no life after death." ...|$|E

He {{did what}} he could to divert her talk, by {{throwing}} in other things; he also showed some kind of pity to her now, and would ask her what she would have? and with various kind of words put {{her out of her}} talk; for when she saw that she was not regarded, she fetched a deep sigh, and lay still. So he went down, and then she called for her children, and began to talk to them. And first she spake to those that were rude, and told them the danger of dying before they had grace in their hearts. She told them also that death might be nearer them than they were aware of; and bid them look when they went through the churchyard again, if there were not little graves there. And, ah children, <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> <b>will</b> it not be dreadful to you if we only shall meet at the day of judgment, and then part again, and never see each other more? And with that she wept, the children also wept: so she held on her discourse. Children, said she, I am going from you; I am going to Jesus Christ, and with him there is neither sorrow, nor sighing, nor pain, nor tears, nor death (Rev 7:16, 21:3,4). Thither would I have you go also, but I can neither carry you nor fetch you thither; but if you shall turn from your sins to God, and shall beg mercy at his hands by Jesus Christ, you shall follow me, and shall, when you die, come to the place where I am going, that blessed place of rest; and then we shall be for ever together, beholding the face of our Redeemer, to our mutual and eternal joy. So she bid them remember the words of a dying mother when she was cold in her grave, and themselves were hot in their sins, if perhaps her words might put check to their vice, and that they might remember and turn to God.|$|E

6000|$|When first I {{entered this}} country, I thought I was got into quite [...] another world; {{the men are}} all of them pigmies to our tall, [...] brawny Highlanders; they are, {{generally}} speaking, not above three [...] cubits high, insomuch that though the whole country of Lapland is [...] immensely large, and I have heard it reckoned by the inhabitants [...] to be above a hundred German leagues in length, and fourscore and [...] ten in breadth, yet I was the tallest man there, and looked upon [...] as a giant. The district in which I live now, is called Uma [...] Lapmark. You must understand, sir, that when I landed at North [...] Cape, in Kimi Lapmark, another district of Lapland, there was at [...] that time a most beautiful lady come to see a sick relation of [...] her father's, who was prefect, or governor of Uma Lapmark, which [...] is a post of great distinction. This lady, by being frequently in [...] the company of French merchants, who traffic now and then in that [...] province of Uma Lapmark, understood French, and having heard of a [...] man six {{foot and a half}} high, desired to see me, and when I [...] came, she happened mightily to like my person; and she talked [...] French, which when I answered, she made great signs of joy, that [...] she could communicate her sentiments to me, and she told me who [...] she was, how rich, and that not one in the company besides could [...] understand a syllable we said, and so I might speak my mind [...] freely to her; she told me the customs of the country, that it [...] was divided into cantons, like our shires, and those cantons into [...] rekars, or certain grounds allotted to families, that are just [...] like our clans. As she was beyond measure beautiful, she was [...] extremely good humoured, a thing rarely to be met among Lapland [...] women, of a better stature than her country women, and very rich, [...] and of good birth: I {{thought it would be a}} prodigious turn of [...] fortune, for a man in my circumstances, if I could make any [...] progress in her heart, which she seemed a little to open to me, [...] in such a manner, for the beginning, as if such a successful [...] event, if managed with prudence, might not be despaired off. [...] Souls that are generous are apt to love, and compassion is the [...] best introducer of love into a generous bosom, and that was the [...] best stock I had to go upon in my courtship! I told her of all my [...] calamities, my dangers, and my escapes; the goodness of my birth, [...] as being allied to one of the greatest nobles in our island; and [...] still she would ask me to tell it her over again, though every [...] time I told it, just at such and such passages, she was forced to [...] drop the tears from her eyes. In fine, I grew more in love with [...] her, more out of a sense of gratitude now, than by the power of [...] her charms before; the matter in a few days went so far, that she [...] owned to me I had her heart. As to marriage, I did not then know [...] the custom of the nation; I thought that if it proved only [...] dangerous to me, I loved her so well that I intended to marry [...] her, though the law was to pronounce me dead for it; but I did [...] not know whether it might not be perilous for her too, to engage [...] in such a state with me, and I resolved in that case, rather to [...] be singly unhappy, than to involve her in distress, and make her [...] the fair companion of my woes. I would not tell her so, for fear [...] she should out of love hide from me those dangers, and therefore [...] using a kind sort of dissimulation, I conjured her to tell me the [...] laws and customs of marriages in that country to a tittle, and [...] that nothing should hinder us from happiness. She told me [...] exactly, as I find since. Our marriage, <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> <b>will</b> be very [...] hard to compass; provided we follow the strict rule of the [...] country. For our women here, are bound not to see the man who [...] makes their addresses to them, in some time. His way of courtship [...] is to come to the parents, and his nearest friends and relations [...] must make her father presents, and supplicate him like a king, to [...] grant him his daughter. The courtship often lasts two or three [...] years, and sometimes has not its effect at last; but if it has, [...] the woman is dragged by her father and brother to church, as [...] unwilling to go to be married, which is looked upon as a greater [...] part of modesty in her, according to the greater disinclination [...] she shows. My father and brother, <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> <b>will</b> both be against [...] it; you have no relations in this country to move your suit, I [...] cannot be so hypocritical as to be dragged unwillingly to him I [...] own I desire for my lawful husband, and therefore, as I have an [...] inclination to you, and I dare own I have, I will not follow [...] those methods which I disapprove. I have talked with several [...] Swedes, and several polite Frenchmen, about their manner of [...] espousals, and I am told, that when souls are naturally united by [...] affection, the couple so mutually and reciprocally loving, though [...] they had rather have their parents' leave if likely to be got, [...] yet, unwilling to be disappointed, only go to the next minister's [...] and marry for better for worse. This way I approve of, for where [...] two persons naturally love each other, the rest is nothing but a [...] modest restraint to their wishes, and since it is only custom, my [...] own reason teaches me there is no error committed, nor any harm [...] done in breaking through it upon so commendable an occasion. I [...] have, added she, a thousand rein-deer belonging to me, beyond my [...] father's power of taking away, and a third share in a rekar or [...] clan, that is ten leagues in compass, in the byar or canton of [...] Uma Lapmark. This is at my own disposal, and it is all your own, [...] if you please to accept of it with me. Our women are very coy, [...] when they are courted, though they have never so much an [...] inclination to their suitor; but good reason and the commerce I [...] have had with persons of politer nations than ours is, teach me [...] that this proceeds entirely from vanity and affectation, and the [...] greatest proof of a woman's modesty, chastity, and sincerity, [...] certainly consists, contrary to the general corrupted opinion, in [...] yielding up herself into the arms of the man she loves. For she [...] that can dally with a heart she prizes, can give away her heart, [...] when she is once balked, to any man, even though she dislikes [...] him. You must judge, my dear father, I must be touched with a [...] woman that was exceeding beautiful, beyond any of her nation, and [...] who had thoughts as beautiful as her person. I therefore was all [...] in rapture, and longed for the matrimony, but still loved her [...] enough to propose the question, I resolved, to her, viz., if it [...] would not be in her nation accounted a clandestine marriage, and [...] prove of great damage to her.|$|E
