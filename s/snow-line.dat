25|$|Matthias Kuhle's {{geological}} {{theory of}} Ice Age development was {{suggested by the}} existence of an ice sheet covering the Tibetan Plateau during the Ice Ages (Last Glacial Maximum?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of Tibet past the <b>snow-line</b> has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater albedo. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling, triggering the Pleistocene Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a cooling surface.|$|E

In {{addition}} to his duties there, and apart from a few journeys to foreign countries, and annual summer botanical journeys in his native land, and illnesses, {{he was able to}} devote himself to research and writing. His expeditions frequently involved visits to mountainous country, below the <b>snow-line).</b> Although primarily for purposes of botanical collection, he also extolled mountain climbing for the sake of exercise and enjoyment of the beauties of nature. In 1541 he prefixed to his treatise on milk and milk products, Libellus de lacte et operibus lactariis a letter addressed to his friend Jacob Avienus (Vogel) of Glarus on the wonders to be found among the mountains, declaring his love for them, and his firm resolve to climb at least one mountain every year, not only to collect flowers, but in order to exercise his body. In 1555 he issued his narrative Descriptio Montis Fracti sive Montis Pilati of his excursion to the Gnepfstein (1920m), the lowest point in the Pilatus chain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{far south}} (Chile Austral), which extends from Valdivia through the Chacao Channel to Cape Horn, the Andes and the South Pacific meet. This {{district}} {{of the country}} is mountainous, heavily forested and inhospitable. The deeply indented coastline is filled with islands which preserve the general outline of the continent southward to the Fuegian archipelago, the outside groups forming a continuation of the Chilean Coast Range. The heavy and continuous rainfall throughout this region, especially in the latitude of Chiloé, gives rise to a large number of rivers and lakes. Farther south this excessive precipitation {{is in the form of}} snow in the Andes, forming glaciers at a comparatively low level which in places discharge into the inlets and bays of the sea. The extreme southern part of this region extends eastward to the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Magellan, and includes the greater part of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego with all the islands lying south and west of it. There are some comparatively level stretches of country immediately north of the Strait, partly forested and partly grassy plains, where sheep farming has been established with some degree of success, but the greater part of this extreme southern territory is mountainous, cold, wet and inhospitable. The perpetual <b>snow-line</b> here descends to 1,000 to 1,200 m (3,500 to 4,000ft) above sea-level, and the forest growth does not rise above an altitude of 300 to 450 m (1,000 to 1,500ft).|$|E

40|$|We present ALMA 1. 3 mm {{continuum}} observations at 0. 2 " (25 au) {{resolution of}} Elias 2 - 24, {{one of the}} largest and brightest protoplanetary disks in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud, and report the presence of three partially resolved concentric gaps located at ~ 20, 52, and 87 au from the star. We perform radiative transfer modeling of the disk to constrain its surface density and temperature radial profile and place the disk structure in the context of mechanisms capable of forming narrow gaps such as condensation fronts and dynamical clearing by actively forming planets. In particular, we estimate the disk temperature at the locations of the gaps to be 23, 15, and 12 K (at 20, 52, and 87 au respectively), very close to the expected <b>snow-lines</b> of CO (23 - 28 K) and N 2 (12 - 15 K). Similarly, by assuming that the widths of the gaps correspond to 4 - 8 x the Hill radii of forming planets (as suggested by numerical simulations), we estimate planet masses in the range of 0. 2 - 1. 5 M_Jup, 1. 0 - 8. 0 M_Jup, and 0. 02 - 0. 15 M_Jup for the inner, middle, and outer gap, respectively. Given the surface density profile of the disk, the amount of "missing mass" at the location of each one of these gaps (between 4 and 20 M_Jup) is more than sufficient to account for the formation of such planets.

60|$|The {{average annual}} {{temperature}} of Las Canadas {{is that of}} N. latitude 53 degrees, Holland and Hanover; in fact, here it is the Pyrenees, and below it Africa. The sun blazed from a desert of blue, and the waving heat-reek rose trembling and quivering from the tawny sides of the foregrounds. The clouds, whose volumes were disposed like the leaves of a camellia, lay far down to the north-east, as if unable to face the fires of day. And now the great trachytic dome, towering in the translucent air, was the marking feature. Its angle, 35 to 42 degrees, or double that of the lower levels, suggests distant doubts as to its practicability, nor could {{we believe that it}} rises 3,243 feet above its western base, Las Cañádas. The summit, not including the terminal Pilon--a comparatively dwarf cone [Footnote: There is a very bad sketch of the Pike in Mr. Scrope's popular work on Volcanoes (p. 5); the eruptive chimney is far too regularly conical.]--is ribboned with clinker, and streaked at this season with <b>snow-lines</b> radiating, like wheel-spokes from a common centre. Here and there hang, at an impossible angle, black lava-streams which were powerless to reach the plain: they resembled nothing so much as the gutterings of a candle hardening on the outside of its upright shaft. Evidently they had flowed down the slope in a half fluid state, and had been broken by contraction when cooling. In places, too, the surface was streaked with light yellow patches, probably of sun-gilt tosa or pumice.|$|R

You must know that there is a line on all high mountains which is called the <b>snow-line.</b> Above this line, the snow that falls each year never disappears; below it the snow, and ice too, undergoes the melting process continually. The portion below the <b>snow-line</b> is always being diminished; that above it is always augmenting; thus the loss of the one is counterbalanced by the gain of the other; and thus the continuity of glaciers is maintained. That part of a glacier which lies above the <b>snow-line</b> is styled neve; it is the fountain-head and source of supply to the glacier proper, which is the part that lies below the <b>snow-line.</b> Sometimes, for a series of years, perhaps, the supply from above is greater than the diminution below, the result being that the snout of a glacier advances into its valley, ploughs up the land, and sometimes overturns the cottages. [See Note 1.] On the other hand the reverse process goes on, it may be for years, and a glacier recedes somewhat, leaving a whole valley of debris, or terminal moraine, which is sometimes, after centuries perhaps, clothed with vegetation and dotted with cottages." ...|$|E

60|$|Aristocracies usually pride {{themselves}} on their antiquity: and the high life of the mountains is undeniably ancient. The plants and animals of the butterfly-zone belong to a special group which appears everywhere in Europe and America about the limit of snow, whether northward or upward. For example, I was pleased to note near the summit of Mount Washington (the highest peak in New Hampshire) {{that a large number}} of the flowers belonged to species well known on the open plains of Lapland and Finland. The plants of the High Alps are found also, as a rule, not only on the High Pyrenees, the Carpathians, the Scotch Grampians, and the Norwegian fjelds, but also round the Arctic Circle in Europe and America. They reappear at long distances where suitable conditions recur: they follow the <b>snow-line</b> as the <b>snow-line</b> recedes ever in summer higher north toward the pole or higher vertically toward the mountain summits. And this bespeaks in one way to the reasoning mind a very ancient ancestry. It shows they date back to a very old and cold epoch.|$|E
60|$|It {{promises}} to be a hard winter. The <b>snow-line</b> has descended a thousand feet upon the peaks, but the passes will be open for weeks to come, and, even if they were blocked, we have established so many depots in the country that Pollock and Nott will have no difficulty in holding their own. They shall not meet with the fate of Elphinstone's army. One such tragedy is enough for a century.|$|E
60|$|Elevation and Depression of the Snow Line as Aiding the Migration of Plants.--We have endeavoured to show (in {{an earlier}} {{portion of this}} volume) that {{wherever}} geographical or physical conditions were such as to produce any considerable amount of perpetual snow, this would be increased whenever {{a high degree of}} excentricity concurred with winter in aphelion, and diminished during the opposite phase. On all mountain ranges, therefore, which reached above the <b>snow-line,</b> there would be a periodical increase and decrease of snow, and when there were extensive areas of plateau at about the same level, the lowering of the <b>snow-line</b> might cause such an increased accumulation of snow as to produce great glaciers and ice-fields, such as we have seen occurred in South Africa during the last period of high excentricity. But along with such depression of the line of perpetual snow there would be a corresponding depression of the alpine and sub-alpine zones suitable for the growth of an arctic and temperate vegetation, and, what is perhaps more important, the depression would necessarily produce a great extension of the area of these zones on all high mountains, because as we descend the average slopes become less abrupt,--thus affording a number of new stations suitable for such temperate plants as might first reach them. But just above and below the <b>snow-line</b> is the area of most powerful disintegration and denudation, from the alternate action of frost and sun, of ice and water; and thus the more extended area would be subject to the constant occurrence of land-slips, berg-falls, and floods, with their {517} accompanying accumulations of débris and of alluvial soil, affording innumerable stations in which solitary wind-borne seeds might germinate and temporarily establish themselves.|$|E
60|$|Changes of Climate Favourable to Migration.--It {{is clear}} then, that during periods when no glacial epochs were {{produced}} in the northern hemisphere, and even when a mild climate extended over the whole polar area, alternate changes of climate favouring the dispersal of plants would occur on all high mountains, and with particular force on such as rise above the <b>snow-line.</b> But during that long-continued, though comparatively recent, phase of high excentricity which produced an extensive glaciation in the northern hemisphere and local glaciations in the southern, these risings and lowerings of the <b>snow-line</b> on all mountain ranges {{would have been at}} a maximum, and {518} would have been increased by the depression of the ocean which must have arisen from such a vast bulk of water being locked up in land-ice, and which depression would have produced the same effect as a general elevation of all the continents. At this time, too, aërial currents would have attained their maximum of force in both hemispheres; and this would greatly facilitate the dispersal of all wind-borne seeds as well as of those carried in the plumage or in the stomachs of birds, since we have seen, by the cases of the Azores and Bermuda, how vastly the migratory powers of birds are increased by a stormy atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{discussion on the}} climate of the southern parts of the continent with relation to its productions, on the <b>snow-line,</b> on the extraordinarily low descent of the glaciers, and on the zone of perpetual congelation in the antarctic islands, may be passed over by any one not interested in these curious subjects, or the final recapitulation alone may be read. I shall, however, here give only an abstract, and must refer for details to the Thirteenth Chapter and the Appendix of the former edition of this work.|$|E
60|$|From the {{combination}} of such unfavourable conditions in Arctic countries and under the <b>snow-line</b> of mountains there results a curious fact, already hinted at above, that the coldest floras are also, from the purely human point of view, the most beautiful. Not, of course, the most luxuriant: for lush richness of foliage and 'breadth of tropic shade' (to quote a noble lord) one must go, as everyone knows, to the equatorial regions. But, contrary to the common opinion, the tropics, hoary shams, are not remarkable for the abundance or beauty of their flowers. Quite otherwise, indeed: an unrelieved green strikes the keynote of equatorial forests. This is my own experience, and it is borne out (which is far more important) by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, who has seen {{a wider range of}} the untouched tropics, in all four hemispheres--northern, southern, eastern, western--than any other man, I suppose, that ever lived on this planet. And Mr. Wallace is firm in his conviction that the tropics in this respect are a complete fraud. Bright flowers are there quite conspicuously absent. It is rather in the cold and less favoured regions of the world that one must look for fine floral displays and bright masses of colour. Close up to the <b>snow-line</b> the wealth of flowers is always the greatest.|$|E
60|$|Towards sundown {{we came to}} a vast cup {{extending}} {{over many}} thousand acres, situated beneath the <b>snow-line</b> of the peak and filled with rich soil washed down, I suppose, from above. So sheltered was the place by its configuration and the over-hanging mountain that, facing south-west as it did, notwithstanding its altitude it produced corn and other temperate crops in abundance. Here the College had its farms, and very well cultivated these seemed to be. This great cup, which could not be seen from below, we entered through a kind of natural gateway, that might be easily defended against a host.|$|E
60|$|Two {{years later}} as Demorest and Stacy sat {{before the fire}} in the old cabin on Marshall's claim--now legally their own--they looked from the door beyond the great bulk of Black Spur to the pallid <b>snow-line</b> of the Sierras, still as remote and {{unchanged}} to them as when they had gazed upon it from Heavy Tree Hill. And, for the matter of that, they themselves seemed to have been left so unchanged that even now, as in the old days, it was Barker's voice as he greeted them from the darkening trail that alone broke their reverie.|$|E
60|$|Mist floated {{about the}} rocks and the evening was dark. To push on was rash, but Jimmy hoped he might {{get down to the}} trees below the <b>snow-line.</b> Anyhow, he must if {{possible}} get off the broken crest of the range. Since noon until the sun went west and shadow crept across the mountain, he and the Indian had crouched behind a shelf and watched snow and stones plunge to the valley. Now all was quiet and the snow was firm, but the mist was puzzling and Jimmy could not see where he went. All he knew was, he followed the neck to lower ground.|$|E

60|$|He {{was born}} at {{beautiful}} Friuli, with the jagged <b>snow-line</b> of the Alps behind him, and before him {{the sun and the}} sea, and the plains of Po; he was a courtier as a boy in Desiderius' court at Pavia, and then, when Charlemagne destroyed the Lombard monarchy, seems to have been much with the great king at Aix. He certainly ended his life as a Benedictine monk, at Monte Casino, about 799; having written a Life of St. Gregory; Homilies long and many; the Appendix to Eutropius (the Historia Miscella, as it is usually called) up to Justinian's time; and above all, this history of the Lombards, his forefathers, which I shall take as my text.|$|E
60|$|It is then {{argued that}} the changes of climate every 10,500 years during the {{numerous}} periods of high excentricity have acted as a motive power in hastening on both geological and biological change. By raising and lowering the <b>snow-line</b> in all mountain ranges it has caused increased denudation; while the same changes have caused much migration and disturbance in the organic world, and have thus tended to the more rapid modification of species. The present epoch being a period of very low excentricity, the earth is in a phase of exceptional stability both physical and organic; and it is from this period of exceptional stability that our notions of the very slow rate of change have been derived.|$|E

60|$|This {{lowering}} {{and rising}} of the <b>snow-line</b> each 10,500 years {{during periods of}} high excentricity, would occur in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres alternately; and where there were high mountains within the tropics the two would probably overlap each other, so that the northern depression would make itself felt in a slight degree even across the equator some way into the southern hemisphere, and vice versâ; and even if the difference of the height of perpetual snow at the two extremes did not average more than a few hundred feet, this would be amply sufficient to supply the new and unoccupied stations needful to facilitate the migration of plants. It is well known that all great mountain ranges have undergone such fluctuations, as proved by ice-marks below the present level of snow and ice.|$|E
60|$|The Tinochorus {{is closely}} related to some other South American birds. Two species of the genus Attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans in their habits; one lives in Tierra del Fuego, above the limits of the forest land; and the other just beneath the <b>snow-line</b> on the Cordillera of Central Chile. A bird of another closely allied genus, Chionis alba, is an {{inhabitant}} of the antarctic regions; it feeds on seaweed and shells on the tidal rocks. Although not web-footed, from some unaccountable habit it is frequently met with far out at sea. This small family of birds is one of those which, from its varied relations to other families, although at present offering only difficulties to the systematic naturalist, ultimately may assist in revealing the grand scheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organised beings have been created.|$|E
