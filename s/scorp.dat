40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a critical component, "Searching for Gills: Fieldwork Meditations" and <b>Scorper,</b> a novel. Each essay in the critical study is devoted to a particular aspect of my novel - literary antecedents that inform style and content, real events that prefigure plots and subplots, personal struggles which darkly and sometimes comically affect tone, places that ground settings; and the individuals, ghosts, and uncanny animals who surface as characters. Part transatlantic literary memoir, part critical discussion, this collection provides a background to the philosophical and psychological roots of my writing, encapsulates my evolving vision of fiction, and contextualizes <b>Scorper.</b> I begin by describing the backdrop behind The Gravedigger. I connect this novel's Sussex setting, its themes of graves and mortality, and its link to graduate writing workshops - all of which prefigure <b>Scorper.</b> Next, I examine the influence of Austrian author Thomas Bernhard, in particular his method of comedic writing that creates unease. After this essay I guide the reader on a literary survey of the animals and animal characters which inform my sense of the uncanny - a construct underpinning my own animal depictions. In "Searching for Gills" I take a walk from Corsham to Bradford-on-Avon on a hunt for a living descendant of the artist Eric Gill, whose ghost forms {{a central role in}} my book; and in my final essay I explore the sometimes uncomfortable connections between my drinking and my writing. <b>Scorper</b> is a dark comedy about an American copy editor on holiday in Ditchling, East Sussex.

Following one of Gant's nightmares, the sergeant is contacted by UIA director General Allance Wilkins, who reinstates Gant immediately for a mission of the utmost importance. According to Wilkins, the <b>Scorp</b> have been conducting top-secret biological warfare experiments upon human prisoners of war, {{in order to create a}} mutated super-soldier dubbed the [...] "G-Nome".

40|$|A Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (<b>SCORP)</b> is {{required}} of every state {{in order to be}} eligible for grants from the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act.

The 2007 Survey on Public Opinions and Attitudes on Outdoor Recreation in Californiaincluded a telephone survey, an adult mail survey, youth focus groups, and a youth mail survey in order to provide a comprehensive view of the outdoor recreation patterns and preferences of Californians. The measurement of various items on the surveys was changed substantially from earlier surveys (2002, 1997, etc.) in order to attempt to increase response rates, improve the readability of the survey instruments, and to provide a contemporary view of outdoor recreation in California. For example, the 2008 telephone survey focused on physical activity that occurs in parks. Similarly, the adult mail survey added components on leisure constraints, issues regarding global warming, and enhanced measures of latent demand for recreation activities. Finally, the youth survey addressed issues important to California‚Äôs youth and included items regarding the recently developed and Governor endorsed California Children‚Äôs Outdoor Bill of Rights (COBR).

40|$|The {{major part}} of this thesis, In the Space Behind His Eyes, is a {{biography}} of Western Australian author, Donald Robert Stuart (1913 - 1983), a colourful life story woven around accepted and persistent myths found in the Australian psyche. In his childhood, Donald Stuart listened to stories about his Scottish immigrant grandfather finding gold on the Victorian fields and his father 2 ÃÜ 7 s part in the 1891 Queensland Shearers strike. His poverty-stricken, but peaceful, upbringing in suburban Perth, Western Australia, was overtaken by the 1930 s Depression and, as a rebellious fourteen-year old, he left home and took to the road. In the next decade or so, as he adopted the north-west outback life, he was exposed further to Australia 2 ÃÜ 7 s traditional yarns and philosophies. He emerged from this period as the outrageous ‚ÄòScorp‚Äô Stuart, who drank too much and {{took advantage of the}} freedoms on offer. At the start of World War II, <b>Scorp</b> volunteered for the 2 nd AlF. He served in the Middle East and somehow survived three-and-a-half years as a Prisoner of the Japanese, including a time on the infamous Burma-Thailand railway. On his return to Australia, he began to tread the writer 2 ÃÜ 7 s path, supplementing his memories with renewed visits to the outback of his youth and working on yet another railway. Encouraged by his sister and her friends, supported by two of his wives and recognised by the Western Australian writh 1 g community, Donald R. Stuart played the role of noted author, a construct only possible because of <b>Scorp</b> Stuart 2 ÃÜ 7 s adventures. Calling on these experiences, in eleven novels and many short stories, he set down his record of a particular Australian life. The varying facets of his complex character come together in his writing, notably through his deep love of the land and in his sympathetic examination of the north-west Aborigines 2 ÃÜ 7 position since white settlement. This biography of a writer sets out to trace the life of Donald Stuart, examine the disparity between Stuart the bushman and Stuart the noted author, and to shed light on the man behind the writing. In the essay following In the Space Behind His Eyes, I explore the biographical form, consider directions the genre has taken in recent years, discuss aspects of biography generally and support choices made in the writing of this biography...|$|E

40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceWithin the French {{national program}} Inventaire Gestion et Conservation des Sols (IGCS), a central {{purpose is to}} provide a DSM at regional scale (R√©f√©rentiel R√©gional P√©dologique). For the Brittany region, soils maps are rare, as the existing ones, not yet digitized, covers approximately 20 % of the area to the 1 / 100 000 and less than 15 % to the 1 / 25 ¬∞ 000. Facing this lack of spatial data on soils, the idea is to map soil-landscape units (Unit√©s de P√©do Paysages : UPP) to the 1 / 250 000, and inform each UPP with a definition of local soils typology (Unit√©s Typologiques de Sols : UTS). This concept of soil-landscape units results from the general idea, established in various disciplines, that there are functional links and reciprocal constraints between environmental factors (hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere). Specifics adaptations and the relative equilibrium of the system assumes a relation between natural vegetation and soils, either at regional scale and local scale. In Brittany, where about 80 % of the surface is devoted to agricultural land since ages, the variety of landscapes are strongly related to the variety of soils. As traditional agriculture (until 1970) was much more dependant on the land (so called ‚Äúterroir‚Äù), we notice that the main agricultural landscape patterns, (size and geometry of parcels, crops rotations or grass land locations, density of hedgerow network, waste land [...] .), still remaining, are revealing soils attributes. Thus, according to the S. C. O. R. P. A. N. model, in region like Brittany O {{is an important factor in}} order to achieve DSM, but it's also important to note where the actual human activities forces soils evolution (urbanisation, protected woodland [...] .). Remote sensing is obviously the main source of data to map landscape units at regional scale, but one must look carefully how to analyse landscape units, including soils properties like surface hydromorphy, without simply focus on land use classification. We would like to pr√©sent two methodological aspects of our work on DSM : 1) The object-oriented image analysis present very interesting opportunities applied to landscapes mapping. Indeed, as landscape is a complex spatial organisation of various elements, pixel-based classifications are not sufficient. Taking account of the neighbourhood, with cover frequency vectors for exemple, gives information on diversity and heterogeneity, but is still limited concerning spatial informations. Using an object oriented approach for the segmentation and classification of Landsat TM images with eCognition software underline the role of patterns in landscape discrimination (linear woodland in a valley, large parcells of cereals in plains, small parcells of grass land on hills, mixed or homogenous spatial organisation [...] .). Beyong the accuracy of landscape classification, the object oriented image analysis has a great interest concerning DSM for at least two reasons : first because landscape patterns are more stable than the land use their contain, second because these patterns can have an influence on soils (erosion [...] .). Object oriented image analysis can also help to deal with scale issues in DSM using a hierarchical approach. 2) Choosing specific variables according to the scale of DSM can be a way of working with the SCORPAN model. Mappping soil-landscape units (UPP) at regional scale, and soils types at local scale, we have to analyse how the SCORPAN factors interfere according to the scale level, looking for the best variables at each level. Obviously scale issues are not just a question of spatial resolution of the digital data or techniques for down or upscaling. We would focus on <b>SCORP</b> variables that are discriminating for units caracteristics at regional scale but insufficient for local variability (agricultural morphology, elevations, spectral radiometrics, climatics indice based on temperature and pr√©cipitations [...] .). Then we also examine the consistency with local variables (slopes, distance to the rivers, parent material, aspect, land use, [...] .) witch could be confusing at regional scale. These are combine using different techniques (fuzzy logic) and both largely use remote sensing as the main -but not unique- source of data (Landsat TM, MODIS, AVHRR [...] .) ...|$|E
