40|$|AbstractThis article, in {{allusion to}} the {{limitation}} of conventional stellar horizon <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> based on orbital dynamics model and nonlinear Kalman filter in practical applications, proposes a new celestial analytic positioning method by stellar horizon <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> for high-altitude flight vehicles, such as spacecraft, airplanes and ballistic missiles. First, by setting up the geometric connexion among the flight vehicle, the Earth and the altitude of starlight refraction, an expression for the relationship of starlight <b>refraction</b> angle and <b>atmospheric</b> density is deduced. Second, there are produced a novel measurement model of starlight refraction in a continuous range of altitudes (CRA) from 20 km to 50 km {{on the basis of}} the <b>standard</b> <b>atmospheric</b> data in stratosphere, and an empirical formula of stellar horizon <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> in the same altitudes against the tangent altitude. Third, there is introduced a celestial analytic positioning algorithm, which uses the least square differential correction instead of nonlinear Kalman filter. The information about positions of a flight vehicle can be obtained directly by solving a set of nonlinear measurement equations. The stellar positioning algorithm adopts the characteristics of stellar horizon <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> thereby removing needs for orbit dynamics models and priori knowledge of flight vehicles. The simulation results evidence the validity of the proposed stellar positioning algorithm...|$|R

Using three types of typical atmospheric background sounding data, we established a simulation model for an actual transmission path and a fitted correction path of an airborne weather radar beam during airplane take-offs and landings based on initial flight parameters and X-band airborne phased-array weather radar parameters. Errors in an ideal electromagnetic beam propagation path are much greater than those of a fitted path when <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> is not considered. The rates {{of change in the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> index differ with weather conditions and the radar detection angles differ during airplane take-off and landing. Therefore, the airborne radar detection path must be revised in real time according to the specific sounding data and flight parameters. However, an error analysis indicates that a direct linear-fitting method produces significant errors in a negatively refractive atmosphere; a piecewise-fitting method can be adopted to revise the paths according to the actual atmospheric structure.

We show the analytical approach which allowed us to assess the need to correct the refraction in J- and H-bands while observing with an 8 -m Unit Telescope. We then developed numerical simulations to go further in calculations. The hypotheses on the instrumental characteristics are those of AMBER (Astronomical Multi BEam combineR), the near infrared focal beam combiner of the Very Large Telescope Interferometric mode (VLTI), but most of the conclusions can be generalized to other single-mode instruments.
