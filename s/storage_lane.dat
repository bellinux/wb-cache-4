40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a parking system for motor vehicles, in which several satellite vehicles (8) for loading and unloading parking places (9) can move in storage lanes (2) through storage aisles. The satellite vehicles can basically travel horizontally in both directions in the storage lanes (2). At each end of a <b>storage</b> <b>lane</b> (2) is a vertical conveyor (10, 11) provided for conveying empty or loaded satellite vehicles (8) from the transfer level to the parking level and vice versa, whereby each vertical conveyor (10, 11) can only transport the satellite vehicles (8) in one direction while the parking system is operating. The movements of the vertical conveyors 10, 11) and the satellite vehicles (8) are simultaneous and independent {{of each other in}} relation to a parking level and a <b>storage</b> <b>lane...</b>|$|E
40|$|We study {{temporary}} storage of fresh produce in a cross-dock center. In {{order to minimize}} cooling cost, compact storage systems are used. A major disadvantage of these systems is that additional retrieval time is needed, caused by necessary reshuffles due to the improper storage sequence of unit loads. In practice therefore, a dedicated storage policy is used in which every <b>storage</b> <b>lane</b> in the system accommodates only one product. However, this policy does not use the planned arrival time information of the outbound trucks. To exploit this information, this study proposes a mathematical model for a shared storage policy that minimizes total retrieval time. The policy allows different products to share the same lane. In order to solve real-sized problems, an effective and efficient heuristic is proposed, based on a greedy construction and an improvement part, which provides near optimal solutions. The gaps between {{the results of the}} heuristic and the lower bound are mostly less than 1 %. The resulting shared storage policy is generally robust against disturbances in arrival or departure times. We compare our shared storage heuristic with dedicated storage to determine which policy performs best under which circumstances. For most practical cases, shared storage appears to outperform dedicated storage, with a shorter response time and better <b>storage</b> <b>lane</b> utilization...|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, {{the rapid}} growth in the {{automobile}} industry springing up like mushrooms after the rain. The affordable prices of vehicles resulted in Malaysians race to buy more that made a total of 4. 91 million of vehicles have been registered to JPP in 2015. Within {{the increasing number of}} vehicles, the capacity of vehicles on the road is also increase. The objectives of this study are to identify the driving behavior during peak hour, to identify causes of traffic congestion at peak hour and to assess the sustainability of U-turn at the Kuantan- Panching intersection, Jalan Kuantan - Gambang. The study area is located at Federal Road 2 from KM 16 until KM 18 Jalan Kuantan – Gambang. A set of video recorder was used as an observation device in the study area to collect the data on driving behavior and congestion factor within this area. The duration of recording is two hours, respectively, during peak hours from 7 a. m. to 9. a. m, 12. 00 p. m. to 2 p. m., and 4 p. m. to 6 p. m [...] The result of this study showed the common driving behavior done by road user’s at the study areas which are red light running, failing to signal, queue jumping, make an illegal U-turn and do not wear the helmet. The result also showed that the factor that lead to congestion happen is the more vehicles queuing in waiting for making a U-turn or right turn to Sg. Pahncing outside the <b>storage</b> <b>lane.</b> This situation happens cause inadequate design of storage length that failing to accommodate the maximum vehicles queuing during peak hour. Results from this study is the hope that the parties concerned, such as the Public Works Department (JKR) or Kuantan Council (MPK) can make some improvements of existing design {{in order to reduce the}} traffic congestion and indirectly will provide good benefits to road users in daily travel...|$|E
50|$|In a lane diet, {{the width}} of a lane is {{decreased}} to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use. Typically vehicular travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than ten feet, and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) <b>storage</b> <b>lanes</b> to nine or ten feet. Resulting space can be applied to pedestrian refuges, medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range.|$|R

Analytical travel distance models are developed for class-based and full turnover storage policies under across-aisle, within-aisle and a newly proposed hybrid product placement schemes. Our computational {{studies show that}} the analytical models developed in this paper are very accurate as compared to simulation results and a comparative study with a real-world warehouse case. Hybrid storage policies proposed in this paper outperform all other traditional storage policies. The paper also presents insights and simple design rules to warehouse practitioners...|$|R
50|$|There are 5 major {{at-grade}} and grade-separated junctions or junction sets on {{the middle}} section, including the end junctions i.e. Saki Vihar Road junction and LBS Marg junction, the details of which are given below: The Saki Vihar Road junction, {{also known as the}} L&T junction, is the first junction on Section 2 and is a staggered one connecting Section 1 with Section 2 via the Saki Vihar road. The JVLR from the Section 1 side (or Jogeshwari side) and from Vikhroli side join the Saki Vihar Road in a staggered manner as the L&T land intercepts the JVLR for 100 m length of initial portion of Section 2. At this location, the L&T flyover across Saki Vihar road connects Section 1 with Section 2 through L&T land. Also, the initial portion of the alignment from Saki Vihar road junction acts as slip roads to the flyover, serving the traffic dispersal from the Saki Vihar road. The at-grade improvements to this intersection were required for easy movement of Turing traffic from/to Saki Vihar road and the JVLR, and for through movement of Saki Vihar road traffic. The at-grade improvements such as auxiliary lanes for free left turning, <b>storage</b> <b>lanes</b> for right turn traffic, channelised islands for guiding the traffic etc. were built for better functioning of ground traffic movement. Also, improvements like widening of carriageway to suit the intersection requirements, median and footpath of the existing Saki Vihar road for 150 m length on either side near the intersection was also carried out under the intersection improvements.|$|R
40|$|Block {{stacking}} storage guarantees high {{storage density}} for end-of-line warehouses in product flow manufacturing systems, which are mostly diffused in food processing and beverage industry. These storage systems, characterized by high volumes per item and limited inventory mix, are organized through <b>storage</b> deep <b>lanes</b> of homogeneous items. Setting the optimal lane depths for the incoming stock-keeping-units (SKUs) influences the overall {{space and time}} efficiency performances, {{as well as the}} layout of the storage zones, the selection of the proper storage modes and equipment. This paper illustrates an original decision-support model to (1) manage existing block storage warehouses, and (2) to aid the design of new block storage systems from green field. The management of a warehouse (1) deals with the assignment of the incoming product lots to the optimal <b>lane</b> depth, <b>storage</b> mode, and zone in a constrained and capacitated storage environment. The design of a warehouse from green field (2) is aided by identifying the optimal configuration of <b>lane</b> depths and <b>storage</b> modes that minimizes the infrastructural costs. The proposed model is formulated via integer linear programming (ILP) and minimizes mutually the costs generated by space and time inefficiencies. The illustrated results obtained by its application to a real case study from the beverage industry, candidate the model as a tool to aid operative and strategic layout issues in deep <b>lane</b> <b>storage</b> systems...|$|R
50|$|The IIT Main Gate {{junction}} and the IIT Market junction {{are both}} 3-armed junctions; the minor arm {{is very small}} road leading to residential areas. Both IIT Main Gate junction and IIT Market junction are provided with traffic signals and the main intention of these signals was for safe crossing of the pedestrians. Since, the distance between IIT Main Gate, IIT Market Gate and Gandhi Nagar junctions is less and due to high traffic volume on Adi Shankaracharya Marg, traffic jams are common especially during peak hours. Grade separated pedestrian facilities (like footbridges) have been constructed to reduce the necessity of pedestrian traffic signals at these locations and lead to faster traffic flow on the JVLR. The LBS Marg junction, {{also known as the}} Gandhi Nagar junction, is the last junction on Section 2 and is a 4-legged one. LBS Marg from Mulund side and Vikhroli side join the JVLR. This junction is the crossing of two important arterial roads of Mumbai carrying long distance through traffic and also local traffic. A flyover across LBS Marg at this location, connects Section 2 with Section 3 of the JVLR. The at-grade improvements to this intersection were required for easy movement of Turing traffic from/to LBS Marg and the JVLR, and for through movement of LBS Marg traffic. The at-grade improvements such as auxiliary lanes for free left turning, <b>storage</b> <b>lanes</b> for right turn traffic, channelised islands for guiding the traffic etc. were built for better functioning of ground traffic movement. Also, improvements like widening of carriageway to suit the intersection requirements, median and footpath of the existing LBS Marg for 150 m length on either side near the intersection was also carried out under the intersection improvements. The JVLR flyover slip roads on both sides are concretized.|$|R
30|$|The {{comparison}} {{shows that}} most of the parts in our system consume fewer resources than those in [19]. In the line detection unit, our improved Hough transform uses part of BRAM as parameter <b>storage.</b> In the <b>lane</b> tracking unit, although the MicroBlaze soft core uses considerable resources, it can accommodate future developments. In other words, the tracking function in [19] is fixed; improvements or the addition of new functions are difficult to accomplish. By contrast, the functions of MicroBlaze in our system are easy to change, improve, and have new functions added.|$|R
40|$|Queuing {{occurs at}} intersections mostly due to {{overflow}} or inadequacy of turn bays. The ODOT L&D Manual Volume 1 has storage requirements for both signalized and unsignalized intersections. Figures 401 - 9 E and 401 - 10 E of the L&D Manual provide the required turn <b>lane</b> <b>storage</b> lengths {{which should be}} compared with the real world conditions to check for adequacy of these lengths as a measure of ensuring that accesses to the left turn lanes are not blocked. In addition to the projected turn lane volume, ODOT’s methodology incorporates both deceleration (based on the speed of the roadway) and potential blockage from the adjacent through lane. Currently, however, there are no records whether these storage lengths computed by the methodology put forth in this manual are valid and accurately represent the actual conditions at intersections in Ohio. This study used real world traffic and queue storage data at some intersections and analyzed these data to validate the model ODOT is currently using. This study used the observed field data to evaluate the ODOT’s model of storage length at intersections. In addition, the queue storage lengths observed from field data were compared with the prediction results of HCS and SYNCHRO computer packages. The model evaluation task evaluated the level of precision of each of the three models (ODOT, HCS, and SYNCHRO) with respect to the field data observation. L&D Manua...|$|R
5000|$|A bronze statue {{was made}} of the Earl by the Exeter {{sculptor}} Edward Bowring Stephens [...] and in October 1880 [...] was erected {{at the front of the}} central garden in Bedford Circus, Exeter, on the spot where Stephens' [...] "The Deer Stalker" [...] had formerly stood. (The latter statue now stands near the Earl's statue, both having been re-located in Northernhay Gardens). The unveiling ceremony was attended by Sir Stafford Northcote (1818-1887), later Lord Lieutenant of Devon 1886-7, (whose own statue in Northernhay Gardens now stands nearby) with the Mayor and Corporation, other dignitaries and the Earl himself. The statue was paid for by public subscription to the Devon Statue Fund, which had attracted 1,300 signatories for this work. A banquet was held following the unveiling ceremony. The plinth is of Cornish granite from the Cheesewring Quarries, on the rear of which a bronze plaque is affixed inscribed with verse from Wordworth's Happy Warrior:"Who not content that former worth stand fast, Looks forward persevering to the last,From well to better daily self-surpast."Although the Circus was destroyed by German bomb damage in World War II, in May 1942, the statue survived intact. It was thereafter hidden from view in <b>storage</b> at Tan <b>Lane</b> until the 1950s when it was re-erected in Bedford Street. A bronze plaque on the front of the plinth is inscribed:"This statue stood in Bedford Circus prior to World War II. The statue was erected on this site (i.e. Bedford Street) by Exeter City Council and Devon County Council as part of a joint landscaping scheme".Following the re-development of Princesshay in 2005 which involved the partial demolition of Bedford Street, the statue was again removed to storage in the Belle Isles council yard. It underwent restoration by Ian Clarke Restoration, including cleansing of graffiti, and was re-erected in Northernhay Gardens. The unveiling ceremony occurred on 9 February 2010, attended this time by only a small handful of interested parties, including the then Earl of Devon and the Lord Mayor, John Winterbottom. [...] Its last move is recorded by an inscription on a granite slab on the ground at the front of the plinth: [...] "Lord Devon was moved in 2010 to Northernhay Gardens from Bedford St".|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{the right}} turn lane length of urban roads in {{left-hand}} traffic countries, such as Australia, UK and India (left-turn lane length in right-hand traffic countries such as USA), at signalised intersections encounters two main geometric features namely, deceleration length and storage length. The literature shows that in routine practice, the deceleration length is generally estimated by using constant deceleration rate. Many researchers consider this assumption for all design speeds unrealistic as it {{does not reflect the}} influence of the pavement condition. Hence, it may be desirable to consider the pavement’s condition in terms of its longitudinal coefficient of friction in the design analysis. In regard to the storage length, a large number of the current guidelines and models estimate the storage length of right-turn lane at signalised intersections under split phase. Hence, {{there is a need to}} examine other phase types and timings and integrate the signal timing as a part of the geometric design In this thesis, two analytical expressions have been analysed for the design of deceleration length. The first expression assumes a constant deceleration rate, and the second expression employs the concept of forces on a rotating wheel in which the coefficient of longitudinal friction between a vehicle’s tyres and the road surface is considered. The calculated deceleration lengths by these two expressions were compared with the recommended values in American and Australian standards as well as with the deceleration lengths that were obtained by a recent simulation study presented in the literature. It has been found that applying a constant deceleration rate of 2. 74 m/s 2 in the first expression provides the values of deceleration length comparable to most guidelines and studies. The second expression highlights the importance of using the pavement design in terms of the coefficient of friction to reduce the deceleration length in the case of limited space. A MATLAB based simulation programme has been developed to provide an estimate {{of the right}}-turn <b>lane</b> <b>storage</b> length for different traffic volumes in order to avoid the problems associated with blocking and overflow of right turn vehicles in 95 % of cycles. In established intersections that cannot be modified due to physical constraints, the model is flexible enough to examine different signal phase types and timings and provides other solutions to reduce overflow and/or blockage situations. The simulation model also takes into consideration the leftover queue. The model results have been compared against an available analytical method in which similar signal phases and timings were investigated. The outcomes are similar to those of the analytical model in most of the signal phase types. The simulation model provides the flexibility to estimate the right-turn lane length for different combinations of through lane and right-turn lane traffic volumes. The developed simulation model has also been validated against the field data using three parameters, namely 95 th percentile of maximum queue, overflow cycle percentage, and blockage cycle percentage. Comparing with the field observations yields a level of accuracy in the range of 78 %- 85 %. Finally this simulation model has been used to optimise the green time in the case of split phase that demonstrates a large difference in traffic volumes of two opposite approaches; this could reduce the mean wait time by up to 28 %...|$|R
