5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, ostensibly {{to protect the}} {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|Dave Finnegan {{was cast}} as Mickah Wallace, a belligerent and hot-tempered bouncer {{who becomes a}} drummer for the band. Parker's first meeting with Finnegan began civilly before their exchanges grew more and more heated. They soon became {{verbally}} abusive, threatening each other with disturbing acts of violence. Parker cast Finnegan immediately, explaining that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> test the limits of Finnegan's aggression, as he wanted the truculence of the character to be convincing. Colm Meaney first learned of the film adaptation while working with Parker on Come See the Paradise. After Parker held auditions for the younger cast members, Meaney secured the role of Jimmy's father Jimmy Rabbitte, Sr. The audition scene in the film, in which various musicians audition at Jimmy Rabbitte's home, required more than 100 band members. Peter Rowen, brother of Irish artist Guggi, appears as a young skateboarding boy who asks to audition for the band. At {{the time of the}} film's production, Rowen had appeared on the cover art of U2's albums Boy (1980) and War (1983), and was a national skating champion.|$|E

25|$|In 1993 Peřina and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to the Czech Republic following {{the removal of the}} Communist regime. Many citizens, not least those in the newly emerging military, greeted him with a 'hero's welcome'. Peřina commented that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> die on home soil and that it was the country that he fought for and stressed repeatedly that he loved the Czech countryside. He was made a General of the Czech Republic Air Forces.|$|E
25|$|Plamondon was re-elected without {{difficulty}} in the 1993 federal election, as the Bloc won fifty-four out of seventy-five seats in Quebec {{to become the}} official opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberal Party won a majority government {{under the leadership of}} Jean Chrétien. At his own request, Plamondon was left out of the Bloc's initial shadow cabinet. He pleaded guilty to the charge against him in April 1994, maintaining his innocence but adding that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> resolve the matter as quickly as possible. He received an absolute discharge and does not have a criminal record.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Capone {{sent two}} {{more of his}} men, Frank Rio and Willie Heeney, to demand that Touhy once again hand over control of his operations. Touhy himself had no armed men among his gang members. Realizing that Capone would try to use force after his refusal, Touhy {{approached}} local law enforcement officers and others to ask for their support. He explained that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sell beer, while domination by the Capone gang would bring lawlessness, gambling and prostitution. Local leaders agreed to help him. Merchants refused to use Capone's gambling punchboards or buy his own low-quality beer. When Rio and Heeney met with Touhy, off-duty police and local farmers were lounging about in the building. This show of force unnerved Capone's gunmen, who reported that Touhy's gang must have had hundreds of armed men.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the Shang dynasty in the middle Yangtze area came to a sudden end with the dynasty's destruction by the Zhou people in c. 1046 BC, who in turn established their own dynasty on the Central Plains. To {{the people of the}} Yangtze, however, the Zhou were not unknown. Indeed, the Records of the Grand Historian record that before the conquest of Shang, the ruler of Chu, Yuxiong, had traveled {{all the way to the}} Zhou court at Feng in Shaanxi to submit to King Wen of Zhou. Perhaps, speculates Ralph D. Sawyer, Yu Xiong had recognized that the Shang dynasty was crumbling or he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ensure good relations with all powerful neighbors. Either way, he recognized the Zhou as promising upstarts and established a friendly relationship with them. Consequently, when the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, Chu supported the former by supplying bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|He {{found it}} {{difficult}} to control the mainly Burman region of Toungoo (Taungoo), over which Ava had only nominal suzerainty. When Thinkhaya, the ruler of Toungoo, came to Ava in 1426, he was treated almost as equal by Mohnyin Thado. Mohnyin Thado tried to encircle Toungoo by making his brother the governor of Tharrawaddy, an adjacent region of Toungoo, and staying on good terms with King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Nonetheless, Thinkhaya formed an alliance with Binnya Ran, decided to raise a rebellion and laid siege to Prome. However Binnya Ran <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep Ava occupied, and was not eager to restart a war with Ava. He sent envoys to Ava, asking for a princess of Ava as the price of alliance. Mohnyin Thado was so angry that he kept the envoys for three months without audience, and had to be dissuaded from killing them. He finally decided to ally with Hanthawaddy and gave his niece to the Hanthawaddy king. Toungoo remained out of his reach {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

25|$|The {{portion of}} the five-year plans which argued for full employment, public {{healthcare}} and housing, labour benefits, and raises {{are a result of}} Eva's influence on the policy-making of Perón in his first term, as historians note that at first he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep imperialists out of Argentina and create effective businesses. The humanitarian relief efforts embedded in the five-year plan are Eva's creation, which endeared the Peronist movement to the working-class people from which Eva had come. Her strong ties to the poor and her position as Perón's wife brought credibility to his promises during his first presidential term and ushered in a new wave of supporters. The first lady's willingness to replace the ailing Hortensio Quijano as Perón's running mate for the 1951 campaign was defeated by her own frail health and by military opposition. An 22 August rally organized for her by the CGT on Buenos Aires' wide Nueve de Julio Avenue failed to turn the tide. On 28 September, elements in the Argentine Army led by General Benjamín Andrés Menéndez attempted a coup against Perón. Although unsuccessful, the mutiny marked {{the end of the first}} lady's political hopes. She died the following July.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked about his role in the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either admit that he sees value in the present world, or that he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be glad to be proven wrong again.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1997, {{three days}} after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. {{received}} a letter from White House Counsel Charles Ruff protesting against the use of Clinton's digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton's appearance [...] "inappropriate". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President's image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy [...] "prohibits the use of the President in any way ...

500|$|Located [...] off {{the coast}} of Florida, Cuba had been {{discussed}} as a subject for annexation in several presidential administrations. Presidents John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson expressed great interest in Cuba, with Adams observing during his Secretary of State tenure that it had [...] "become an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union". He later described Cuba and Puerto Rico as [...] "natural appendages to the North American continent"—the former's annexation was [...] "indispensable to the continuance and integrity of the Union itself." [...] As the Spanish Empire had lost much of its power, a no-transfer policy began with Jefferson whereby the U.S. respected Spanish sovereignty, considering the island's eventual absorption inevitable.

500|$|Following [...] "The War of the Worlds" [...] {{broadcast}} of his CBS radio series The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract. RKO Pictures studio head George J. Schaefer {{wanted to work}} with Welles after the notorious broadcast, believing that Welles had a gift for attracting mass attention. RKO was also uncharacteristically profitable and was entering into a series of independent production contracts that would add more artistically prestigious films to its roster. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1939, Schaefer constantly tried to lure the reluctant Welles to Hollywood. Welles was in financial trouble after failure of his plays Five Kings and The Green Goddess. At first he <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season. Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939 and on his first tour, he called the movie studio [...] "the greatest electric train set a boy ever had".|$|E
500|$|Unable {{to contact}} U2 manager Paul McGuinness, Peter Shapiro instead {{proposed}} {{the idea to}} Owens. The latter was researching art content for the upcoming Vertigo Tour and thought the concept {{could be used to}} show 3D video as part of U2's concerts. Shapiro explained that the technology was not that developed and <b>simply</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> document the tour itself in 3D, but Owens was not interested in making a film of the band, fearing it would interfere with the tour, so she declined the offer. After Shapiro showed Owens the 3D footage of the NFL games, Owens expressed interest in directing the proposed film, despite having no previous experience. According to bassist Adam Clayton, U2 were not interested in making another concert film, but Owens [...] "pushed it down [...] throats". Once the band viewed the test shots, frontman Bono expressed interest in the project and convinced his band-mates to commit. Since U2 had already experimented with video technology in the past, they were interested in the project as a technological experiment rather than a means to make profit, and as a means to share the live experience with fans who could not afford concert tickets.|$|E
