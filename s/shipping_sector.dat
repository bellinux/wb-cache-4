25|$|Greece is a {{democratic}} and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life, and a very high standard of living. A {{founding member of the}} United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and {{has been part of the}} Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). Greece's unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, prominent <b>shipping</b> <b>sector</b> and geostrategic importance classify it as a middle power. It is the largest economy in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} {{regarding what}} flag should {{be adopted by}} the new confederation was first raised by the <b>shipping</b> <b>sector</b> and its desire to have an internationally recognisable identity. Virtually all international shipping {{that belonged to the}} confederation originated from either Prussia or the three former Hanseatic city-states of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. Based on this, Adolf Soetbeer, secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, suggested in the [...] on 22 September 1866 that any planned flag should combine the colours of Prussia (black and white) with the Hanseatic colours (red and white). In the following year, the constitution of the North German Confederation was enacted, where a horizontal black-white-red tricolour was declared to be both the civil and war ensign.|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{began to}} decline in the 1930s and 1940s, with the depredations of the Great Depression. The construction of the elevated Gowanus Parkway, which replaced the BMT Third Avenue Elevated in 1941, effectively cut the neighborhood off from the harbor. Sunset Park's <b>shipping</b> <b>sector</b> declined after World War II, {{with the rise of}} truck-based freight shipping and ports in New Jersey; the growth of the closure of the Army Terminal; and the decreasing importance of heavy industry in the northeastern United States. In 1945 Third Avenue was widened to ten lanes at the surface level to accommodate the truck traffic to/from the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. [...] This widening necessitated the removal of all industrial buildings and housing {{on the east side of}} the avenue. The four-lane parkway was replaced in the 1960s with a similarly named six-lane expressway to carry truck and car traffic to and from the then-new Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which opened in 1964.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2012 investigative {{piece by}} the Somalia Report, the OBP paper {{and other similar}} reports that attempt to {{calibrate}} the global cost of piracy produce inaccurate estimates based {{on a variety of}} factors. Most saliently, instead of comparing the actual costs of piracy with the considerable benefits derived from the phenomenon by the maritime industry and local parties capitalizing on capacity-building initiatives, the OBP paper conflated the alleged piracy costs with the large premiums made by insurance companies and lumped them together with governmental and societal costs. The report also exaggerated the impact that piracy has had on the <b>shipping</b> <b>sector,</b> an industry which has grown steadily in size from 25,000 billion tonnes/miles to 35,000 billion tonnes/miles since the rise of Indian Ocean piracy in 2005. Moreover, the global costs of piracy reportedly represent a small fraction of total maritime shipping expenses and are significantly lower than more routine costs, such as those brought on by port theft, bad weather conditions or fuel-related issues. In the United States alone, the National Cargo Security Council estimated that between $10–$15 billion were stolen from ports in 2003, a figure several times higher than the projected global cost of piracy. Additionally, while the OBP paper alleged that pirate activity has had a significantly negative impact on regional economies, particularly the Kenyan tourism industry, tourist-derived revenue in Kenya rose by 32% in 2011. According to the Somalia Report investigation, the OBP paper also did not factor into its calculations the overall decline in successful pirate attacks beginning {{in the second half of}} 2011, a downward trend largely brought about by the increasing use of armed guards. According to Admiral Terence E. McKnight, ransom demands and payments have risen exponentially and the financers and pirates decided they are willing to wait as long as it takes to receive [...] "high seven-figure payouts".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the dynamics of the spot freight rate in the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) shipping market. The spot freight rate process is nonparametrically specified so that the model allows for maximal flexibility in fitting the data. The model is estimated using data for the Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) sector and the estimation results are compared to those of crude oil tankers available in the literature. The empirical results suggest that the LPG spot freight rate can be appropriately described by a simple linear stochastic model and does not exhibit the non-linearity found in other bulk <b>shipping</b> <b>sectors.</b> ...|$|R
