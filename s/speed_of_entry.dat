40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{to gain an}} understanding of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into high-tech industries by "latecomers," private and national firms from late-industrializing countries. While entry is traditionally measured with R&D performance, we have approached it from the perspective of skill formation. Accordingly, we have investigated how some latecomers have quickly learned new skills and connected their existing technical knowledge with a new stock of knowledge, defining the speedy (latecomer) entrant as the first latecomer (for an initial entry) and the first-to-market (for subsequent entries), respectively. Specifically, we have conceptualized that a fast entry requires a continuous search for new markets and adaptation to a new environment. In this regard, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into the high-tech industries, based on the experience in the mid-tech industries, indicates of dynamic capability and, accordingly, becomes a competitive asset in the context of late-industrializing countries. Theories in economics, management, or geography, which our hypotheses for <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> are drawn from, have explained factors or mechanism that enable a firm to perform better. We have first examined how literature envisages the effects of business groups, a form of firms prevalent particularly in late-industrializing countries, in association with <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> However, relevant theories tend to compete and the overall theoretical predictions are not clear. Second, we have further reviewed literature in technology management and expected integration to occur both externally and internally when entry is executed. Third, given that the relevant theories highlight geographic proximity for generating externalities, we have suggested different measurements of geographic proximity for international learning, a distance from the headquarters of the partner firm and an international joint venture. (cont.) Based on the literature review, we have postulated that business groups, integration capability, and geographic proximity are significantly associated with the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> by latecomers and have constructed three hypotheses: H 1. <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> by latecomers is related to business groups; H 2. <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> by latecomers is related to integration capability; and H 3. <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> by latecomers is moderated by the relationship between their integration capability and geographic proximity. In order to test these hypotheses, we have adopted two methodologies, which are case study and regression analysis. Next, we have selected the thin film transistor liquid crystal diode (TFT-LCD) and wireless handsets industries. The TFT-LCD and wireless handset industries tend to have complementary features: TFT-LCD has a relatively short history compared to other electronics industries and is capital-intensive. In contrast, the wireless handsets are consumer goods and connected with the telecommunication service industry. Reviewing the histories of both industries, we have identified latecomer entrants and have subsequently collected their data by accessing available archives and interviewing managers and engineers. From the case studies, we have found in the fast latecomers several interesting points regarding entry dynamics: first, the owners of these latecomers continuously tried to upgrade their industrial technologies into more sophisticated ones by closely benchmarking the Japanese firms. Second, the fast latecomers mobilized managerial know-how from their firms and properly redeployed it to the necessary posts. Third, while managerial knowledge was possible to acquire within a firm, technical knowledge had to be externally supplied; but acquisition of the updated technical knowledge was extremely difficult. Fourth, due to the difficulties, latecomers accessed whatever sources they could and used whatever channels were available. (cont.) Therefore, no single path to acquiring the necessary knowledge was dominant. Unique aspects in skill formation and knowledge acquisition by latecomers have also been observed: while acquiring technical knowledge from outside sources, both the first latecomer and the first-to-market successfully relocated their skills from prior industries to the new ones quickly, for example, from semiconductor manufacturing to TFT-LCD or from beeper/car phone/cordless phone manufacturing to wireless handsets. Finally, in the TFT-LCD industry, the first latecomer and the first-to-market took advantage of business cycles and aggressively increased capital investment during downturns. In the wireless handset industry, these latecomers, associated with the government research institute, developed an alternative communication technology and quickly mass-produced it. However, not all counter-cycle investment strategies by latecomers in the TFT-LCD industry succeeded. Similarly, not all governmental efforts to incubate technologies were successful. Based on findings from case studies, we have also empirically tested our hypotheses. A brief summary of our regression analysis is that our first hypothesis is partially supported. The factors related to business groups are not necessarily significantly related to becoming the first latecomer or to making subsequent entries (the first-to-market performance) fast. In contrast, our second hypothesis is supported. The result indicates that the first latecomer performance and the first-to-market performance require different types of integration capability. Specifically, becoming the first latecomer is determined by efficiency in external learning, while the speed of subsequent product entries is driven primarily by internal efficiency. (cont.) We interpret that the relative weight of external learning may decrease over time, once a latecomer has entered. Finally, our third hypothesis is partially supported. Geographic proximity to the headquarters of the partner firm increases <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> perhaps by facilitating communication and diffusing best practices, but international joint venture between a latecomer and a leading incumbent firm does not necessarily enhance integration with sources and does not expedite <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> by Jooyoung Kwak.

Because {{there is more than one}} character on a key, the number of keys can be reduced to a point limited only by the required accuracy of the text produced which is itself limited by the ability of "disambiguation " algorithms to decode the ambiguous text strings. Reducing the number of keys increases text entry rates and reduces learning time. Experiments with keysets of 10, 12, 14, and 16 keys have produced keystroke rates of 3. 3 to 1. 7 characters per second and a 6 % keying error while the disambiguation programs can produce an accuracy of 85 to 95 %.

Ofloxacin (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 13 +/- 0. 12), temafloxacin (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 19 +/- 0. 18), and levofloxacin (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 24 +/- 0. 16) showed slow bactericidal activity (not significantly different from each other), while CP- 116, 517 (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 59 +/- 0. 21) and Win 57273 (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 72 +/- 0. 20) showed increased bactericidal activities in CSF that was comparable to that of ceftriaxone at 10 mg/kg. h (delta log 10 CFU/ml. h, - 0. 80 +/- 0. 17). These improved in vivo activities of the newer quinolones reflected their increased in vitro activities. All quinolones and ceftriaxone showed positive correlations between bactericidal rates in CSF and concentrations in CSF relative to their MBCs.

40|$|China {{has become}} one of the most popular foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) destinations since 1980 s, and its automotive industry always an attractive playing field for the global automakers. As there was a gap in the passenger car market in before the 1980 s, all the domestic manufacturers mainly at that time only produced trucks and buses for transportation, tractors for agriculture, and jeeps for military. Thus, the entry seems very necessary to supply this gap in the market; the early entry will help them to win the first move advantage. For European and U. S. automakers, the entry into China has become part of their global strategy. They strive to build up a business base in the Far East that will limit the dominance of Japanese firms. From a global strategy point of view, the step of entry into China seems very necessary; however, Chinas unstable institutional environment and different kinds of regulation limit the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> What the Chinese government wants to achieve through publishing the regulations to foreign funds, is to foster its own automotive industry and is not interested in turning China into an expansion base for European, American and Japanese auto industries. Simply, the government does not want to lose the control on this pillar industry while it opens to the world. Till the mid- 1990 s, the auto industry was still highly protected in China; high tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, screening, foreign equity limits and local content requirements are several common obstacles to the entry of foreigners. In the past, many researchers have studied the policies in Chinas automotive industry, but most of them mainly focus on two questions: 6 how does the protection environment in the auto industry affect the utility of domestic consumer by limiting their access to the cheaper import car?; and, how does the protected environment limit the development of the industry? Most of articles argued that the policy environment in China provides too much protection and is not good for the growth of domestic manufacturers. However, there are few studies focused on the foreign perspective; this paper would change the angle from the domestic side to foreign side. This paper looks to explore the link between policy regulations and entry model selection. In order to analyse this link, two famous joint ventures in the China automotive industry has been selected for study, the Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot. In the case, three dimensions about the entry strategy of these two companies will be analyzed. Finally, this paper is going to answer the question of whether the regulation is the main factor affect foreigners entry model selection and whether the limited availability of the entry model would be the important factor that affects the performance of joint ventures. In this paper, there are four main sections: Literature review, Methodology, Research analysis, and Conclusion. In the literature review section (Chapter 2), all the related theories and models about the entry model selection and entry strategies will be presented. The methodology (Chapter 3) will explain the research method of this research applied, the way to access the data, and the limitation of this research as well. Research analysis is a large section. All economic factors and regulations related to how foreign funds get in Chinas automotive industry will be analyzed in Chapter 4. The case studies of Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot will be shown in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 respectively; the three dimensions of entry strategy of each joint venture: partner selection, control over alliance, 7 and conflict management will be fully analyzed here. Finally, this paper is going to present some implications through the comparison of Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot cases, and end with a conclusion: Regulation and Policy, in some degree, limit the number of available entry model choices to the foreigner, but any limitation on the entry model selection should not fully be responsible to the performance of the foreign funds in this industry. By implementing and designing a right entry strategy based on the assumption of limit entry model choice, the foreign funds can still perform very well...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the present work thesis is {{diversification}} strategy. In particular the Portuguese context is studied, {{it proved to be}} breeding grounds for my studies. The interest of this research derived from the Erasmus experience that gave me the opportunity to know the companies analyzed, the Portuguese economic context and to collect all the data and information that the study required. In this thesis an empirical analysis of two Portuguese companies is proposed: Sonae and Jeronimo Martins. These companies focus on the retail industry and through operations, such as acquisitions and partnerships, they have diversified their activities over the years. Nowadays Sonae and Jeronimo Martins are leaders of the Portuguese retail industry and they have reinforced their position. The aim of the study is to determine whether the number of acquisitions and partnerships concluded by the companies has influenced the number of stores that the two companies have opened in the years 1998 - 2013. To achieve this objective both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis will be conducted: in fact a descriptive analysis of company data from a historical viewpoint will be proposed, in this regard a time series of data from 1998 to 2013 will be built for each company, and also an econometric analysis of time series data of the two case studies. The first part of the thesis is a comprehensive review of diversification strategy literature to better understand diversification strategy {{and the rest of the}} work. Starting from definitions of diversifications given by authors and the description of related and unrelated diversification, benefits and costs of diversification, and the theories of why firms diversify, the attention will be focalized on the relationship between diversification and performance. Literature review will be concluded with the link between resources and type of diversification. The second chapter focalizes on the diversification modes. The choice of entry mode is an important part of a firm’s new business development strategy. A diversifying entrant is concerned not only about what markets to enter, but also how to enter them. Firms typically enter new markets through internal development, a common alternative is to acquire a firm or business unit that is already established, a further alternative is to enter through alliances such as joint ventures. In any given context, the three modes are likely to differ referring to the costs, risk, and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> In the chapter advantages and disadvantages of the three diversification methods will be specified. In the last part of the work the empirical analysis is made, it is organized on three “levels”: the first one is an introduction of the two companies, in which a company overview and a business units descriptions are present both for Jeronimo Martins and Sonae. The second “level” is a description analysis of company data, in this part there is a descriptive analysis of the data of the two companies from a historical viewpoint, in this regard a time series of data from 1998 to 2013 has been built for each company. Thus, analyzing operating and financial trends of companies in the last 16 years relevant information on the overall performance of the companies may be obtained, moreover a comparative analysis of the companies is provided. The third “level” is an econometric analysis, to achieve the objective of the study four econometric models are proposed. In these econometric models the dependent variable is the number of stores, while the key independent variables are the number of acquisitions and the number of partnerships. Furthermore also an economic-financial variable or a variable of business growth will be added to each model, in order to verify its influence to the dependent variable. Finally the conclusions of the study are presented. From a methodological point of view, the electronic databases of the library of Universidade de Coimbra, (B-on or Proquest and ABI-INFORM Global), the consolidated annual reports of Jeronimo Martins and Sonae, and the software “STATA Version 12 ” for processing the time series in the econometric analysis, were used...|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{perspective is}} taken {{to the analysis of}} data upon the follower firm timing behaviour of 99 ‘non-pioneering’ firms introducing low-fat products into US food markets, encompassing extant approaches in marketing, economic and managerial literatures. The payoffs to followers are considered to be related to demand growth, the extent of competition, early mover advantages, firm characteristics, and risk and entry cost reductions. The propensity of firms to react to these potential payoffs is considered as involving four sequential stages and determined by organizational characteristics. The findings suggest: (i) follower firms vary in the rate at which they ultimately move through each and all of the stages identified; (ii) there is evidence that firm characteristics, time and previous entry (although not simply) impact upon the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> market <b>entry</b> by firms reflecting the various influences on payoffs identified; and (iii) <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> reaction are related to firms' abilities to internalize external market development...|$|R
40|$|From 1997 to 2001 {{we observe}} a faster {{growth in the}} number of Nonemployer {{businesses}} (mostly Partnerships) vis-à-vis F irms in the USA, a country with the mildest asymmetries between the two types of enterprise with respect to taxation, administrative entry barriers and other institutional aspects. The different <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> net <b>entry</b> may be due to the internal organisation of the two types of enterprise and its relation to some market features. In a continuous time stochastic environment, with sunk costs, we model entry as a growth option. Partnerships and F irms display specific entry patterns in terms of output price and size since they react in diverse fashions to market uncertainty. In most cases, the Partnership is less risky and better suited to enter under conditions of high volatility, as during the years betwee...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of the use of bar code readers and {{programmable}} keypads for <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> specimen details and results in two microbiology laboratories. METHODS: The solutions selected in each laboratory are described. The benefits resulting from the implementation were measured in two ways. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> data <b>entry</b> and error reduction were measured by observation. A questionnaire was completed by users of bar codes. RESULTS: There were savings in time and in reduced data entry errors. Average time to enter a report by keyboard was 21. 1 s v 14. 1 s for bar coded results entry. There were no observed errors with the bar code readers but 55 errors with keystroke entries. The laboratory staff of all grades found the system fast, easy to use, and less stressful than conventional keyboard entry. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect time savings should accrue from the observed reduction in incorrectly entered data. Any microbiology laboratory seeking to improve the accuracy and efficiency <b>of</b> data <b>entry</b> into their laboratory information systems should consider the adoption of this technology which can be readily interfaced to existing terminals...|$|R
