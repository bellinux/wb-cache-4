25|$|The non-Hungarian {{population}} of the territory ceded by the First Vienna Award {{can be divided into}} three groups – those who left already before the Award came into force, those who remained in their place during the war and until it was integrated to Czechoslovakia again and those who were expelled from the region. The Czechoslovak press reported after the Munich Agreement that border adjustments with Hungary were imminent, so the Czechoslovaks had five weeks to decide whether they stayed or left. According to Janics those officials and farmers who opted to move away (81,000 people) were given administrative, military and public <b>safety</b> <b>support</b> and they were provided road vehicles and railway wagons to transport their property. Deák estimates the number of state employees and Czech colonists who left territory before the arrival of the Hungarian army as one half while the total number of Slovaks who left territory before December 1938 (voluntarily or by forced expulsion) is unknown and can be estimated only by comparison of two censuses from 1930 and 1938 and assumed population growth. His estimate is about 50,000 people of Slovak nationality.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 SNC-Lavalin won an {{international}} bidding process for the reactor design division of the company. [...] Prior to the acquisition, 10% of SNC Lavalin's international power workforce (400 of 4000) were engaged in the production and refurbishment of nuclear reactors. [...] Concerns raised about the deal include a lack of commitment by SNC-Lavalin to keeping the design division intact (its size makes it more capable of providing ongoing <b>safety</b> <b>support).</b> [...] For 2010 and 2009 combined Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd lost $493 million. [...] Following divestiture of the reactor design division, AECL will consist of the current Nuclear Laboratories division, including the Chalk River laboratory (produces isotopes for medical imaging), {{and will continue to}} be a Crown Corporation on paper but will privatise the operation of its facilities.|$|E
