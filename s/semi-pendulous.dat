50|$|Dendrobium milaniae (Dr. Paciencia Milan's Dendrobium) is {{flower of}} the Orchid family found in Leyte, Visayas in the Philippines, {{where it is}} found growing as an {{epiphyte}} above bodies of water at elevations up to 600 metres. The flower grows to approximately 1.5 cm. The plant is <b>semi-pendulous</b> and sympodial. Pseudobulbs are 10 cm by 2 cm; 3 to 6 green lanceolate leaves are present on the top third of the pseudobulb. Hans Fessel and Emil Lückel named this species in 1996 in Die Orchidee.|$|E
5000|$|Pinalia polyura, or many-tailed pinalia, is {{a member}} of the orchid family endemic to the Philippines. It is <b>semi-pendulous</b> and sympodial, with pseudobulbs that are 20 cm long, 1 cm in diameter, and {{somewhat}} club shaped. Each new growth begins halfway along the previous year's pseudobulbs, making the plant longer each year. Each pseudobulb has about 5 shiny, lanceolate leaves approximately 15 cm long and 2 cm wide. Inflorescences appear at the upper portion of the plant and are pendulous, about 10 cm long and bear up to 40 flowers each 1.5 cm in diameter. It grows as an epiphyte and sometimes as a semi-terrestrial plant at elevations to 2,400 meters.|$|E
5000|$|... ''''Firescreen'''', a select, fast growing, {{broad leaf}} form. Glossy, copper-red new foliage growth is {{encouraged}} by a regular prune and feed, maturing to mid green. Selected for hedging from 1.2 m high, Firescreen has a <b>semi-pendulous,</b> dense habit, a short leaf internode and holds its foliage {{all the way}} to the ground. Unpruned height over 6 metres. Can also be used as a pot specimen for topiary or as a standard. Firescreen tolerates full sun to shade, windy conditions, heat waves and cold to -2 °C and it is psyllid and borer resistant. Bred by Tracey and Stuart Knowland of Bangalow Wholesale Nursery NSW, with plant breeders' rights granted in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Palm to 20 m tall, trunk to 26 cm in {{diameter}} and expanded at the base. Leaves about 3 m long with a moderate lateral twist. Crownshaft is green. Pinnae have silver/grey scales below and tend to be <b>semi-pendulous</b> in the apical 1/3. They lack ramenta on the midrib below. The infiorescence, branched to 3 orders, usually holds the branches erect though they become pendulous in fruit; it is usually wider than long and remains green with maturation of the fruit. Flowers are white/cream. Staminate flower has 13-19 stamens. Fruit is red/brick-red at maturity, 17-25 mm long. Fibres in the mesocarp are in two distinct layers, the outer with thin straight fibres, the inner with thick, fiat to 0.3 mm wide, usually held tight in the dried state.|$|E
40|$|The {{auditory}} thermometry {{has being}} used for measurement of temperature of dogs. However there is different acoustic conch conformation in this species, being that the pendulous ears can alter the auditory microclimate. This research aimed to study the difference of rectal and auditory canal temperatures according to acoustic conch conformation in dogs. One hundred and eleven dogs were used with erect ears (group I), <b>semi-pendulous</b> (group II) and pendulous (group II) with 37 animals each group. The measurement of rectal temperature (TR) was realized with traditional thermometer mercury column and measurement of both external ears temperature with infrared ear thermometer. The average hearing temperature (TAM) was obtained and realized difference between TR and TAM, being the results classify in scores, A=TAM<TR until 1. 2 °C and B=TAM<TR more than 1. 2 °C. The average of TAM was 37. 15 °C± 0. 81, whereas that TR was 38. 68 ºC± 0. 59. The average difference between TAM and TR was 1. 53 ºC± 0. 75. Seventy one ears (63. 96 %) were classify in the score B and 40 (36. 04 %) in the score A. The TAM average was 37. 17 °C± 0. 85, 37. 35 °C± 0. 50 and 36. 93 °C± 0. 96 respectively in groups I, II, III. There {{was no difference in}} the type of ear in TAM (p= 0. 5097). The average difference between the TR and TAM in the group I was 1. 57 °C± 0. 65, in group II 1. 26 °C± 0. 49 and in the III 1. 76 ºC± 0. 96. Predominated ears in the score B independent of type (p= 0. 7606). In the conditions of this study the average ear temperature is lower than the rectal temperature by 1. 53 °C± 0. 75 and the conformation of the ear does not influence the average ear temperature. A termometria auditiva vem sendo utilizada para mensuração da temperatura em cães. Porém, existem diferentes conformações da concha acústica nesta espécie, sendo que orelhas pendulares podem alterar o microclima auditivo. Portanto, objetivou-se estudar a diferença das temperaturas retal e do canal auditivo de acordo com a conformação da concha acústica em cães. Foram utilizados 111 cães hígidos com orelhas ereta (grupo I), semipendular (grupo II) e pendular (grupo III) com 37 animais cada. A aferição da temperatura retal (TR) foi realizada com termômetro tradicional coluna de mercúrio e aferição da temperatura de ambas as orelhas externas com termômetro auricular infravermelho. Foi obtida temperatura auditiva média (TAM) e realizada diferença entre TR e TAM, sendo os resultados classificados em escores, A=TAM<TR em até 1, 2 ºC e B=TAM<TR em mais de 1, 2 ºC. A média da TAM foi 37, 15 ºC± 0, 81, enquanto que a da TR foi 38, 68 ºC± 0, 59. A diferença média entre TAM e TR foi 1, 53 ºC± 0, 75. Setenta e uma orelhas (63, 96 %) foram classificadas no escore B e 40 (36, 04 %) no escore A. A média da TAM foi 37, 17 °C± 0, 85, 37, 35 °C± 0, 50 e 36, 93 ºC± 0, 96 respectivamente nos grupos I, II e III. Não houve influência do tipo de orelha na TAM (p= 0, 5097). A diferença média entre a TR e TAM no grupo I foi 1, 57 ºC± 0, 65, no grupo II 1, 26 ºC± 0, 49 e no III 1, 76 ºC± 0, 96. Predominaram orelhas no escore B independente do tipo (p= 0, 7606). Nas condições deste estudo a temperatura auditiva média é menor que a retal 1, 53 °C± 0, 75 e a conformação da orelha não influencia a temperatura auditiva média em cães...|$|E
