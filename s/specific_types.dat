5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|The government's income {{came from}} five {{principal}} sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, {{such as when}} it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land, wasteland, <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors.

5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E

5|$|Nathu La {{is one of}} {{the three}} open trading border posts between China and India; the others are Shipkila in Himachal Pradesh and Lipulekh (or Lipulech) at the trisection point of Uttarakhand–India, Nepal and China. Sealed by India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 {{following}} numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing {{a key role in the}} growing Sino-Indian trade. However, trade is limited to <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of goods and to specific days of the week.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The first {{style of}} Hachijō-daiko {{is thought to}} descend {{directly}} from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only <b>specific</b> <b>types</b> of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
