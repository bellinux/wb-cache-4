40|$|This {{thesis is}} a legal {{analysis}} of the fiduciary duty {{in the relationship between}} the Crown and Aboriginal Peoples in Canada as it specifically applies to the exercise of power by the Federal Government for national defence under section 91 (7) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal power of "Militia, Military and Naval Service, and Defence," and under the royal prerogative. Aboriginal and treaty rights may be infringed by defence activities conducted by the Canadian Forces and by foreign military allies training in Canada. Defence activities usually occur in non-residential areas in Canada and it is these areas that Aboriginal and treaty rights are often exercised by the holders of these rights. In applying the justification test developed in Sparrow to the infringement by defence activities of Aboriginal and treaty rights that are now "recognized and affirmed" in subsection 35 (1), I submit in the thesis that different legal interests need to be considered in assessing the justification of such activities. An assessment of justification would be made to ensure that the honour of the Crown was upheld and that any necessary infringement was minimized in resolving the conflict of interest. This assessment would be based on a full examination of the conduct of the Crown and of defence officials in the planning and implementation of any defence activity with real or potential impact on section 35 rights. Such an examination would involve considerations such as planning and identification of Aboriginal and treaty rights potentially affected in defence areas; alternative defence activities considered; consultation with Aboriginal Peoples; disclosure of information to Aboriginal Peoples concerning planned defence activities; the record of consideration by defence officials of information provided by affected Aboriginal Peoples; the adequacy of compensation for affected or extinguished rights; completion of other statutory reviews; and proportionality of degree or <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> and effort to minimize.

[...] Does the benefit to be derived from the legislation outweigh the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infringement?</b> [...] The legislation may not produce effects of such severity so as to make the impairment unjustifiable. [...] Professor Hogg has argued that merely satisfying the first three criteria of the Oakes test probably amounts to automatic satisfaction of the fourth criterion.|$|R

25|$|During general play, players may {{position}} themselves {{anywhere on the}} field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches, depending on the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infringement.</b> The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} look at the holding of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Trinity Western University v The Law Society of British Columbia that freedom of religion obliged the Law Society of British Columbia to approve Trinity Western University’s proposed new law school. The authors argue that that holding was wrong, and {{for a number of}} reasons. They contend that it was wrong in its characterization of the freedom of religion interest invoked by TWU; wrong in its assessment <b>of</b> the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> on freedom <b>of</b> religion resulting from the Law Society’s refusal to approve TWU’s new law school; wrong in both its characterization of the equality interest of members of the LGBTQ community invoked by the Law Society and in its assessment of the importance of that equality interest; and wrong in concluding that the balance of the competing interests of freedom of religion and equality in the context in question fell in favour of the former. Each of these contentions is developed separately and at some length, with significant reliance being placed inter alia on a number of relevant Supreme Court of Canada judgments to which the authors argue the Court of Appeal gave either no or insufficient attention...|$|R
40|$|Libertarian self-ownership {{views in}} the {{tradition}} of Locke, Nozick, and the left-libertarians have supposed that we enjoy very powerful deontological protections against infringing upon our property. Such a conception makes sense when we are focused on property that is very important to its owner, such as a person’s kidney. However, this stringency of our property rights is harder to credit when we consider more trivial infringements such as very mildly toxic pollution or trivial risks such having planes fly overhead. Maintaining that our rights against all infringements are very powerful threatens to implausibly make such pollution and trivial risk broadly impermissible. This paper suggests that self-ownership views have tended to inappropriately conflate the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> different types <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> and that treating all infringements so seriously is implausible because it would make too much impermissible. I consider several ways to avoid this result within a self-ownership framework and conclude that the best approach is to allow that the strength of the protection against infringements should be tied to the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the harm <b>of</b> the <b>infringement...</b>|$|R

40|$|The study uses power {{relations}} theory to investigate existence of perceived retaliation against internal whistleblowers in Sub-Saharan Africa using evidence from employees in public institutions of Kenya. Focus {{was on the}} way perceived retaliation is related to <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing, whistleblower psychological power and management support to whistleblowers. The research design was quantitative, exploratory and analytical using cross-sectional data. Respondents were selected using simple random sampling and requested to complete a self-administered questionnaire. Findings were that perceived retaliation against whistleblowers exists and it was positively correlated to position of a wrongdoer and <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing. Whistleblower psychological power and changing jobs among whistleblowers were associated with management support, position of a wrongdoer and perceived <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing by whistle blowers. Position of a wrongdoer and <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing were associated with management support to whistleblowers. A hierarchical regression revealed that <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing, whistleblower psychological power and management support to whistleblower predicted perceived retaliation. These findings suggest participative compliance programmes, organisational ethical cultures and management support to reduce perceived retaliation against whistleblowers as discussed in the policy and managerial implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} the frequency and <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> parental offending were related to their offspring offending. Police officers in one Dutch province completed a form to register risk factors and the actions undertaken when they came into contact with offenders aged 8 – 14 years. These juveniles were followed for 18 months to establish whether or not they committed more crimes. In addition, the parents of these children were traced in the police criminal record systems. Data were gathered from 577 children and their parents. Of these children, 34 % were exposed to parental criminality, of which 33 delinquents had two criminal parents and 163 had one criminal parent. If both parents were criminal, the child had the highest frequency of offending. Further, the frequency of parental offending was positively related to the frequency of the child's offending. Concerning the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> juvenile crimes, the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the committed offences of the father showed a positive relation with the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> his child's offending. Unexpectedly, a negative association was found between the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> maternal offending and the <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> her child offending. These results offered {{a better understanding of the}} influence that parents with a criminal history have on their children. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms underlying this relationship in order to provide appropriate prevention and intervention strategies...|$|R
