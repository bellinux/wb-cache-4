40|$|A {{new class}} of solitary waves arises in the {{solution}} of nonlinear wave equations with constant impedance and no dispersive terms. These solitary waves depend on a balance between nonlinearity and a dispersion-like effect due to spatial variation in the sound speed of the medium. A high-order homogenized model confirms this effective dispersive behavior, and its solutions agree well with those obtained by direct simulation of the variable-coefficient system. These waves are observed to be long-time <b>stable,</b> globally <b>attracting</b> <b>solutions</b> that arise in general as solutions to nonlinear wave problems with periodically varying sound speed. They share some properties with known classes of solitary waves but possess important differences as well...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the follow-the-leader model for traffic flow. The position of each car z_i(t) satisfies an ordinary differential equation, whose speed depends {{only on the}} relative position z_i+ 1 (t) of the car ahead. Each car perceives a local density ρ_i(t). We study a discrete traveling wave profile W(x) along which the trajectory (ρ_i(t),z_i(t)) traces such that W(z_i(t)) =ρ_i(t) for all i and t> 0; see definition 2. 2. We derive a delay differential equation satisfied by such profiles. Existence and uniqueness of solutions are proved, for the two-point boundary value problem where the car densities at x→±∞ are given. Furthermore, we show that such profiles are locally <b>stable,</b> <b>attracting</b> nearby monotone <b>solutions</b> of the follow-the-leader model...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for studying the}} linear stability of self-similar solutions is discussed. These fundamental ideas are illustrated on three prototype problems: a simple ODE with finite-time blow-up, a second-order semi-linear heat equation with infinite-time spreading solutions, and the fourth-order Sivashinsky equation with finite-time self-similar blow-up. These examples are used to show that self-similar dynamics can be studied using many of the ideas arising {{in the study of}} dynamical systems. In particular, the use of dimensional analysis to derive scaling invariant similarity variables is discussed, as well as the role of symmetries in the context of stability of self-similar dynamics. The spectrum of the linear stability problem determines {{the rate at which the}} solution will approach a self-similar profile. For blow-up solutions it is demonstrated that the symmetries give rise to positive eigenvalues associated with the symmetries, and it is shown how this stability analysis can identify a unique <b>stable</b> (and observable) <b>attracting</b> <b>solution</b> from a countable infinity of similarity solutions...|$|R
50|$|It is {{extremely}} insightful {{as to the}} presence of <b>stable</b> <b>solutions</b> (<b>attracting</b> or repelling) in the study of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations where times stepping {{in the form of the}} Crank Nicolson algorithm {{is extremely}} time consuming as well as unstable in cases of nonlinear growth of the dependent variables in the system. The study of turbulence is another field where the Numerical Continuation techniques have been used to study the advent of turbulence in a system starting at low Reynolds numbers. Also, research using these techniques has provided the possibility of finding stable manifolds and bifurcations to invariant-tori in the case of the restricted three body problem in Newtonian gravity and have also given interesting and deep insights into the behaviour of systems such as the Lorenz equations.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that if T: X → X is {{completely}} continuous or if there exists an n 0 > 0 such that Tn 0 is completely continuous, then T point dissipative implies {{that there is a}} maximal compact invariant set which is uniformly asymptotically <b>stable,</b> <b>attracts</b> bounded sets, and has a fixed point (see Billotti and LaSalle [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 6 1971]). The result is used, for example, in studying retarded functional differential equations, or parabolic partial differential equations. This result has been extended by Hale and Lopes [J. Differential Equations 13 1973]. They get the result that if T is an α-contraction and compact dissipative then there is a maximal compact invariant set which is uniformly asymptotically <b>stable,</b> <b>attracts</b> neighborhoods of compact sets, and has a fixed point. The above result requires the stronger assumption of compact dissipative. The principal result {{of this paper is to}} get similar results under the weaker assumption of point dissipative. To do this we must make additional assumptions. We will show these assumptions are naturally satisfied by stable neutral functional differential equations and retarded functional differential equations with infinite delay. The result has applications to many other dynamical systems, of course...|$|R

40|$|The {{alignment}} of vorticity and scalar gradient with the eigendirections {{of the rate}} of strain tensor is investigated in turbulent buoyant nonpremixed horizontal and vertical flames. The uniqueness of a buoyant nonpremixed flame is that it contains regions with distinct alignment characteristics. The strain-enstrophy angle Psi is used to identify these regions. Examination of the vorticity field and the vorticity production in these different regions indicates that Psi and consequently the alignment properties near the flame surface identified by the mixture fraction band F approximately equals F(sub st) differ {{from those in the}} fuel region, F > F(sub st) and the oxidizer region, F F(sub st) (and F < F(sub st) for the vertical flame) band(s) show(s) vorticity/beta alignment. The implication of this result is that the scalar dissipation, epsilon(sub F), attains its maximum value always near F approximately equals F(sub st). These results are also discussed within the framework of recent dynamical results [Galanti et al., Nonlinearity 10, 1675 (1997) ] suggesting that the Navier-Stokes equations evolved towards an <b>attracting</b> <b>solution.</b> It is shown that the properties of such an <b>attracting</b> <b>solution</b> are also consistent with our results of buoyant turbulent nonpremixed flames...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an accurate keypoint detector that is stable under view-point change. In this paper, keypoints correspond to actual junctions in the image. The principle of ASN differs fundamentally from other keypoint detectors. At each {{position in the}} image and before any detection, it systematically estimates {{the position of a}} potential junction from the local gradient field. Keypoints then appear where multiple position estimates are attracted. This approach allows the detector to adapt in shape and size to the image content. One further obtains the area where the keypoint has <b>attracted</b> <b>solutions.</b> Comparative results with other detectors show the improved accuracy and stability with viewpoint change. ...|$|R

In this context, a striking result appeared few years ago: the numerical integration, with the first order Euler scheme, of a scalar ordinary differential equation having a stationary globally <b>attracting</b> <b>solution</b> gives chaotic solutions with arbitrary small step of integration. This result is on the opposite side with respect to what we would expect.

This problem is approximately solved using Meshless Collocation, and it is shown that the approximate solu- tion {{can be used to}} determine the domain of attraction...|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{ideas in}} {{stability}} {{theory is that the}} qualitative behavior of an orbit under perturbations can be analyzed using the linearization of the system near the orbit. In particular, at each equilibrium of a smooth dynamical system with an n-dimensional phase space, there is a certain n×n matrix A whose eigenvalues characterize the behavior of the nearby points (Hartman-Grobman theorem). More precisely, if all eigenvalues are negative real numbers or complex numbers with negative real parts then the point is a <b>stable</b> <b>attracting</b> fixed point, and the nearby points converge to it at an exponential rate, cf Lyapunov stability and exponential stability. If none of the eigenvalues are purely imaginary (or zero) then the attracting and repelling directions are related to the eigenspaces of the matrix A with eigenvalues whose real part is negative and, respectively, positive. Analogous statements are known for perturbations of more complicated orbits.|$|R
