40|$|This work {{explores the}} use of both <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> and D-glucosamine HCl (GLU) as a {{hydrophilic}} carrier to improve the dissolution rate of piroxicam (PXM) whilst investigating the electrostatic charges associated with the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM:GLU solid dispersions were prepared and characterised (XRPD, DSC, SEM). Dissolution and triboelectric charging was also conducted. The {{results showed that the}} <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM alone, without GLU produced some PXM form II (DSC results) with no enhancement in solubility relative to that of the parent PXM. XRPD results also showed the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process to decrease the crystallinity of GLU and solid dispersions produced. The presence of GLU improved the dissolution rate of PXM. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM: GLU at a ratio of 2 : 1 had the most improved dissolution. The <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process generally yielded PXM-GLU spherical particles of around 2. 5 µm which {{may have contributed to the}} improved dissolution. PXM showed a higher tendency for charging in comparison to the carrier GLU (- 3. 8 versus 0. 5 nC/g for untreated material and - 7. 5 versus 3. 1 nC/g for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> materials). <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> GLU demonstrated higher charge densities than untreated PXM and untreated GLU, respectively. Regardless of PXM:GLU ratio, all <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM:GLU solid dispersions showed a negligible charge density (net-CMR: 0. 1 – 0. 3 3 nC/g). <b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> of PXM:GLU solid dispersions can be used to produce formulation powders with practically no charge and thereby improving handling as well as dissolution behaviour of PXM...|$|R

M. smegmatis that are <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> from stationary phase, subjected to accelerated temperature stress conditions, regrown to stationary phase, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> again, and resubmitted to this same process four consecutive times, display, on the fourth <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> iteration, an approximate ten-fold increase in stability during accelerated temperature stress testing, surviving up to 105 days. Microarray tests revealed significant differences in genetic expression of M. smegmatis between log phase and stationary phase conditions, between naïve (non spray-dried) and multiply cycled dried M. smegmatis (in log and stationary phase), and between M. smegmatis in the dry powder state following a single <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> operation and after four consecutive <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> operations. These differences, and other phenotypical differences, point to the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway as a probable pathway contributing to bacteria survival in the spray-dried state and suggests strategies for <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{that may lead to}} significantly greater room-temperature stability of mycobacteria, including mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the current TB vaccine...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{anti-inflammatory}} and antiallodynic {{effects of}} <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders starting from leaves, stems, roots, {{the mixture of}} leaves and stems, {{as well as the}} whole plant aqueous solutions of Phyllanthus niruri L., Phyllanthaceae, were assessed. Gallic acid, used as chemical marker, was quantified by HPLC in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders. Carrageenan-induced inflammatory and allodynic responses in the mouse paw were used as pharmacological models. Quantitative and qualitative differences among chemical composition of different herb parts were observed. The oral administration of leaves or leaves plus stems <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced allodynic effect (42 ± 5 and 54 ± 3 %, respectively). Additionally, the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema (35 ± 6 %). The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of roots, stems, or the mixture of leaves, stems and roots (100 mg/kg, p. o.) did not exhibit antiallodynic or antioedematogenic effect in the same model. In conclusion, differences in the chemical composition of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders from P. niruri are reflected in their in vivo pharmacological actions. Despite of a direct relationship of anti-inflammatory and antiallodynic effects with the gallic acid content had been observed, especially in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves, the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves plus stems showed to be more effective, suggesting a synergic effect between their constituents...|$|R

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable dry powders were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray dried powders were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained. The conformation of the secondary structures of sCTs was affected by both mannitol content and <b>spray</b> <b>dry</b> inlet temperature. The sCT-CS-NPs were recovered after reconstitution of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders in an aqueous medium. The sCT release profile from <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders was similar to that from sCT-CS-NPs. In vitro inhalation parameters measured by the Andersen cascade impactor indicated sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders having promising aerodynamic properties for deposition in the deep lung. Determination of the plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration to rats revealed that the inhalable sCT-CS NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders provided higher protein absorption compared to native sCT powders. Conclusion: The sCT-CS-NPs with mannitol based <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders were prepared to have appropriate aerodynamic properties for pulmonary delivery. The developed system was able to deliver sCT via a pulmonary route into the systemic circulation.

40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans. As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma {{is considered one of the}} most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma.

40|$|THESIS 7172 The {{solid state}} {{properties}} {{of a range}} of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> excipients and drugs and co-spray dried excipient/excipient, drug/excipient and drug/drug, systems were investigated. The excipients investigated were lactose, polyethylene glycol 4000, polyethylene glycol 20, 000, polyethylene oxide 300, 000 and chitosan. The drugs investigated were bendroflumethiazide, salbutamol sulphate, salbutamol base, ipratropium bromide monohydrate, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. The methods of analysis used to characterise the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> systems were powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis was performed on some samples to determine the presence of certain elements. The effect of co-spray drying lactose with PEG 4000 on the recrystallisation rate of lactose was studied under differing temperature and humidity conditions. Release studies were performed on BFMT/PEG 4000 systems to assess the effect of the modification of the solid-state properties on the dissolution behaviour of BFMT present in the BFMT/PEG co-spray dried composites. Twin stage impinger (TSI) experiments were carried out on systems which had potential for inhalation therapy. Lactose, chitosan, BFMT, salbutamol sulphate and budesonide <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> alone were X- ray amorphous. Formoterol fumarate was not <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> alone in this work but was known to form an amorphous composite on <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> Chitosan starting material was amorphous while the other materials were crystalline prior to <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> The polyethylene glycol/oxides of various molecular weights, salbutamol base and ipratropium bromide did not form X-ray amorphous phases on <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> Some reduction in crystallinity was observed for PEG 4000, PEO 300, 000 and salbutamol base.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to use a four-fluid nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>drier</b> as a new {{one-step}} method for preparing rifampicin (RFP) -containing mannitol microparticles. A RFP-acetone/methanol (2 : 1) solution and aqueous solutions of mannitol (MAN) were simultaneously supplied through different liquid passages of a four-fluid nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>drier</b> and then dried to obtain MAN microparticles containing RFP. Using a cascade impactor, the in vitro aerosol performance of RFP powder and RFP-MAN microparticles with 1 : 5, 1 : 10, and 1 : 20 ratios was compared. The in vivo retention of RFP in the lungs of rats after intratracheal administration of 1 : 20 RFP-MAN microparticles was also compared. The RFP-MAN microparticles had better aerosol performance than RFP powder and delivery to the lung stages improved as the fraction of MAN was increased. For the 1 : 20 RFP-MAN microparticles, deposition in stages 2 – 7 was approximately 43 %, which is sufficient for treatment. Approximately 8 % of the RFP-MAN microparticles were deposited in stages 6 – 7, which corresponds to alveoli containing alveolar macrophages. The initial retention of RFP in the lung following pulmonary delivery of 1 : 20 RFP-MAN microparticles was higher than following oral or intravenous administration of RFP, but the elimination was rapid, resulting in the disappearance of RFP from the lung within 4  h. The plasma concentration–time profile of RFP after intratracheal administration of 1 : 20 RFP-MAN microparticles was consistent with the profile for RFP retention in the lung. Addition of cholesterol or phosphatidylcholine to RFP had little effect on its retention in the lung. The RFP-MAN microparticles were effective for delivery of RFP to the lung, but the RFP rapidly removed from the lung into the blood circulation. This study demonstrated that RFP-containing MAN microparticles prepared in one step using the four-fluid nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>drier</b> efficiently deliver RFP to the lung, although methods must be developed to prolong its retention and improve targeting to alveolar macrophages...|$|E

The results of a recent international collaborative study on the development of <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process optimization software for skim milk manufacture are presented as an example of the application of 1 -D simulation in milk processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} on <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of whey has significantly changed {{during the last}} 20 years. Industries started to apply more technical and scientific information for whey powder production. The main problems in whey powder are: sticking and caking during production and storage, which lead to decrease of the yield. These problems {{are based on the}} control of the glassy state during the dehydration process and storage. Due to the importance of the glass transition, <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters should be adjusted to improve whey powder production. This review highlights the scientific research that deal with the impact of these factors on <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of whey. To conclude, in order to improve the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of whey the industries should: apply thermohygrometers to measure the air properties; to stablish the relation between water activity and outlet air relative humidity; and to adjust <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters based on the properties of the air and whey...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{preferred}} methods of converting food and pharmaceutical solutions into powder form. Very high product throughput, hygienic and highly automated process and relatively benign thermal and dehydration stress on products associated with this process has made it ubiquitous in powder manufacture. Compared to freeze <b>drying,</b> <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> is significantly less expensive both in terms of operation and capital costs. In this chapter, key features of <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> such as underlying operational principle, types of spray nozzles used, the flow pattern of droplets/particles and drying medium within the drying chamber, the particle formation process of individual droplet are discussed in considerable detail. The modelling aspect of a single droplet subjected to <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> environment has also been included. Finally, the most commonly considered characteristics of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders including morphology, crystalline/ amorphous nature and solubility are highlighted and discussed. The content presented in this chapter will be very useful for practising engineers, technologists, researchers as well as postgraduate and undergraduate students...|$|R
