5|$|To {{supplement}} water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake, even {{as early}} as in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake. However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake {{on a list of}} five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased.|$|E
5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to set up}} a water company for the town; pumping {{machinery}} was installed and works constructed in 1880 to provide a clean water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town. In 1948, the council took over the company and in 1962 its operation was handed to the Kesteven Water Board, which was absorbed by the Anglian Water Authority in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With {{disruption of the}} epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Uxbridge and District Electricity Supply Company had been {{established}} in Waterloo Road, {{and much of the}} town was connected by 1902, although some houses still had gas lighting in 1912.

5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted {{the view that}} monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|Bond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano {{in power}} in Bolivia while Quantum are given a {{monopoly}} to run the water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country. Bond ascertains Quantum are damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to {{flow into the}} cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Electricity <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Tiruchirappalli is {{the headquarters of the}} Trichy region of TNEB. The city and its suburbs form the Trichy Metro Electricity Distribution Circle, which is subdivided into six divisions. A chief distribution engineer is stationed at the regional headquarters at Tennur. Water supply is provided by the Tiruchirappalli City Corporation. The city gets its drinking water supply from the Kaveri River and 1,470 bore wells linked to 60 service reservoirs in and around the city. Four of the six head works from which the city gets its water supply are maintained by the municipal corporation and the rest by other agencies.|$|E
5|$|Electricity <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Ramanathapuram circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB).

About 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day in the four zones covering the whole of the town. Rameswaram does not have a sewerage system for disposal of sullage and the disposal system consists of septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry untreated sewage out of the town to let out raw into the sea or accumulates in low-lying area.|$|E

Both OAHU and TAHU consume the same amount of fan energy. The paper presents the system models, the simulation procedures and the simulation results...|$|R
5|$|Electricity <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Sirkazhi Circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Sirkazhi municipality from the Kollidam river; it is distributed through five water tanks which supply 2million (two million) litres a day. Push carts and tricycles are used to collect solid waste, which is deposited in marsh lands located outside the town. Sirkazhi municipality is implementing underground drainage and the current sewerage system is through septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry away untreated sewage, which is released into the sea or accumulates in low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} Clerk to the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of <b>Supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament {{in the first}} case, and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had {{established himself as a}} courtier and scientist at Whitehall, London, and employed Bruce as a trusted messenger between Whitehall and the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line and stations would {{be provided by}} a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Rome {{had become a}} major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
