25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} airbrushes {{work with}} a single-action mechanism where the depression of the trigger actuates air flow through the airbrush. [...] The airbrush's color flow and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> are adjusted separately from the trigger action. [...] This is done through an adjustment of the airbrush's needle placement within its paint tip, by the turning of the paint tip on an external mix airbrush (Badger 350 or Paasche Model H are good examples of single-action external mix airbrushes) or the turning of a needle setting dial on an internal mix airbrush (Badger 200 or Iwata SAR are good examples of single-action internal mix airbrushes). [...] The color volume and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> are maintained at a fixed level until the airbrush user re-adjust the setting. Single-action airbrushes are simpler to use and generally less expensive, but they present limitations in applications in which the user wishes {{to do something more}} artistic than simply apply a good, uniform coat of color.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-action or {{double-action}} airbrushes {{enable the}} simultaneous adjustment of both air and color at the trigger, {{by allowing the}} user to actuate air by depressing the trigger and simultaneously adjust color by sliding the trigger back and forth. [...] This ability to adjust color flow while spraying the airbrush, coupled with the users adjustment of distance from the sprayed surface allows for the variation of fine to wide lines without stopping to re-adjust the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> as is necessary with a single-action airbrush. [...] This allows for greater spray control and enables {{a wider variety of}} artistic effects. [...] This type of airbrush requires some amount of practice to become proficient in triggering technique and control, but it offers greater artistic versatility to the artists once the triggering technique is learned. Dual-action airbrushes (Badger Patriot 105, Paasche VL, Iwata CM-C are all good examples of dual-action airbrushes) are of a more sophisticated design model than single-action airbrushes, which tends to make them the more expensive of the two.|$|E

40|$|The use of splash {{plates and}} dual {{impinging}} liquid jets are common methods for fuel atomization, but {{the combination of}} these methods has not been explored. The goal of this experiment is to analyze how splash plate position and orientation affect the spray geometry for this combined method. The <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed for a single jet against a splash plate and two orientations of dual impinging jets against a splash plate. For all three cases, the <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> are analyzed for various splash plate angles between 30 and 60 degrees relative to the jet centerline. For the dual impinging jets, the splash plate is tested in multiple positions relative the two jets’ unimpeded impingement point.

The most desirable spray characteristics occur when the splash plate is at least two jet diameters lower than the unimpeded impingement point and at an angle between 45 and 60 degrees.

2500|$|Fuel {{systems on}} the modern diesel engine were not {{designed}} to accommodate biodiesel, while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends e.g. B20. Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail fuel system operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> and atomization are directly related to injection timing.|$|E

The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice.

In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Flat spray patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study on liquid mass distribution in effervescent sprays using water and air as working fluids {{is presented in}} this paper.

A large variety of instantaneous <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed in bubbly flow regime indicating a highly unsteady atomization process.

The evaluated showerheads were separated into three groups according to usage water flow and the level of satisfaction.

Limited by the scarce water resources, CSP plants built in arid areas choose Natural Draft Dry Cooling Tower (NDDCT) to remove waste heat. However, NDDCT suffers from low efficiency in hot summer days. To resolve this problem, inlet air spray-cooling is introduced to improve the performance of NDDCT. In {{the first part of this}} paper, the research progress focused on both the theoretical and experimental studies on NDDCT are summarized.

The results illustrate that the inlet air pre-cooling would improve the efficiency of NDDCT and thus reduce power generation loss under high-ambient air temperature conditions.

The water curtain is an open-air wet scrubber consisting of a linear array of elevated spray nozzles oriented such that the conical <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> are directed toward the ground. The <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> overlap to form a curtain of fine water droplets that “scrub ” dust particles from the air. Previous, small-scale prototypes removed nearly 80 % of total suspended particulate (TSP), but the system tested at that time operated at an extremely high specific flow rate of nearly 112 l min- 1 m- 1. The present, field-scale system operates at a more realistic specific flow rate of 15 l min- 1 m- 1, which is approximately equal to the water used by a conventional, solid-set sprinkler system operated 6 hours per day to suppress dust emissions from a cattle feedyard having a 1. 6 -km critical downwind frontage. Using an upwind/downwind sampling paradigm on three ideal monitoring dates in August 2002 and May 2003, the curtain appeared to remove about 40 % of suspended particulate matter (PM) along the centerline of the water curtain's zone of influence.

The {{objective was to}} establish quantitative, dimensional relationships between initial impact conditions (impact velocity, projectile diameter, and target thickness) and {{the diameter of the}} resulting crater or penetration hole. Such dimensional relationships and calibration experiments are needed to extract the diameters and fluxes of hypervelocity particles from space-exposed surfaces and to predict the performance of certain collisional shields.

However, crater depth is modestly deeper for our silicate impactors than the canonical value based on aluminum projectiles and aluminum 6061 -T 6 targets.
