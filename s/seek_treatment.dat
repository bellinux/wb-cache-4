People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and <b>seek</b> <b>treatment.</b> Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the reasons for <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> among 300 male young heroin abusers in Hong Kong (172 newcomers and 128 repeaters) recruited from non-government drug treatment agencies. A 55 -item Reasons for <b>Seeking</b> <b>Treatment</b> Scale (Reasons Scale) was developed to measure the participants' reasons for <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment.</b> The {{results showed that the}} scale was internally consistent and six factors with reliable related subscales were extracted. The findings are generally consistent with the "hitting of the bottom" hypothesis, which posits that drug abusers will seek help only when they perceive that their addicted life is out of control. The results suggest that drug treatment and rehabilitation services should target the reasons for <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> among young drug abusers. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors that contribute to women delaying <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for obstetric fistula. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select 384 study participants. A cross sectional analytical research design was used; data was collected by structured, closed ended questionnaires. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied. Results show a significant correlation between traditional treatment and delay in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> (P-Value = 0. 012). The presence of parents has a significant correlation in reaching treatment centres (p-value = 0. 013), those women who are speaking about their fistula have less chance of delay in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> (p-value = 0. 008), having no income significantly associated with delay in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> (AOR = 0. 28) and women living closer to the treatment centres have less chance of delay (p-value = 0. 008). Therefore, there are a number of factors that significantly influence women from early <b>seeking</b> of <b>treatment</b> for their fistulae. Health StudiesM. A. (Public Health...|$|R

Once news of his death had arrived, the match was abandoned and the Italian football calendar was suspended for a week. Milan and Arsenal paid respect to Spagnolo by observing a minute's silence before the first leg. A crowd of 38,044 witnessed both clubs play out a goalless draw at Highbury; the first leg marked the return of Paul Merson, who spent time away from football in order to <b>seek</b> <b>treatment</b> for various addictions.

40|$|Aims: Most people {{appear to}} stop using {{cannabis}} when getting older, but a certain subgroup becomes cannabis dependent, has problems on various life areas and needs treatment. Our aim is to compare treatment seekers with primary cannabis problems to those with primary alcohol, opiate, amphetamine or cocaine problems {{on a number of}} socio-demographic and <b>treatment</b> <b>seeking</b> variables. Understanding how primary cannabis users <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> differ from other treatment seekers may assist clinicians in better tailoring treatment processes to clients’ needs. Methods: For this purpose, intake information on 1 626 persons <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> in one of 16 treatment agencies in the province of Antwerp (Belgium) was registered via an on-line web application. Primary cannabis users <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> were compared with primary alcohol, opiate, amphetamine and cocaine users by means of bivariate analyses (Chi-square tests and analyses of variance), followed by four logistic regression analyses. Findings: 14. 5 % of all clients had cannabis as their primary drug. Compared to primary alcohol, opiate, amphetamine or cocaine users <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment,</b> cannabis users <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> appeared to be male, younger than 30 years old, Belgian and student. They are often referred to treatment by police or justice and 43. 6 % of them can be considered “single” cannabis users. Multivariate analyses showed that besides age and gender, using no other substances than the primary drug and being registered in outpatient facilities only were significant determinants for being a primary cannabis user <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment.</b> Conclusions: Primary cannabis users can clearly be differentiated from other drug users <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment.</b> Although cannabis plays an important part in a polydrug use pattern, persons who have cannabis as their primary drug are often using only this one substance. Since they have often brief contacts with treatment agencies, {{more research is needed to}} measure the effect of this brief intervention...|$|R

The goal of this research study was to do an explorative study in order to establish the experiences of patients with regard to social and health services factors that contribute to delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for Tuberculosis. The objectives to meet the goal were an exploration and description of patients’ experiences with regards to social and health service factors contributing to delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for Tuberculosis. Another goal was to make recommendations on social and health service factors that contribute to patients’ delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> based on the findings. The research study had been of a qualitative nature exploring patients’ experiences of social and health services factors that contribute to delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for Tuberculosis. Qualitative research was used in this study using semi-structured interviews with an interview guide. Data analysis was done according to the eight steps as recorded in Tesch in Creswell (1994 : 155). The findings of this research were or include social factors contributing to patients’ delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for TB. There were four categories related to social factors namely socio-economic, substance abuse, psycho-social and interpersonal relations factors. The findings also indicated that there were health service factors contributing to patients’ delay in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for TB. These include quality of health care services, attitudes of medical staff and other medical conditions treatment. It was concluded that social and health services, as mentioned indeed contribute to patients’ delays in <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for Tuberculosis. Recommendations for practice included better case detection, treatment and health education. In order to address the various social factors as described above it is necessary to treat TB holistically and include a social worker as part of the multidisciplinary team. South Afric...|$|R

He hoped his new rank {{would bring him}} a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to <b>seek</b> <b>treatment</b> for his eye, {{but it was not}} until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill, and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.|$|E

He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E

Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to <b>seek</b> <b>treatment</b> for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E
40|$|Background: The time spend for prehospital {{action and}} the type of <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> {{behaviors}} of MI patients are important. The present study was conducted to answer <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> behaviors at patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in Kashan Shahid Beheshti Hospital. Â Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional case study was conducted on 280 patients with MI during 2006 - 7. Data were gathered using a questionnaire including 7 questions related to the demographic characteristics of subjects, the time of manifestation of symptoms, the hospitalization history, the initial perception of symptoms, the patient's <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> behaviors and methods using to come to the hospital. The patient's behaviors were categorized in two groups of appropriate and inappropriate. Results: From a total of 280 samples 73. 8 were men (mean age: 61. 37 Â± 13. 34 years) and 26. 4 were female (mean age: 67. 21 Â± 9. 97 years). The most revealed behaviors were rest (42. 5), self medication (34. 3) and calling the Emergency Medical Service (22. 85), using sublingual TNG (20. 5), respectively. Only 107 patients had appropriate <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> behaviors. On the other hand, 60 patients displayed inappropriate treatment behaviors. A combination of appropriate and inappropriate <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> behaviors have also reported by 113 patients. Conclusion: A considerable number of the patients with MI demonstrated inappropriate <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> behavior. Public education would be helpful to reduce the prevalence of the inappropriate behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Due to lack {{of formal}} sex {{education}} in India, the unpleasant past sexual experiences and at times normal physiological activities can lead to various myths and sexual beliefs. Base on their beliefs, individuals <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation have their set of expectations. Premature ejaculation (PME) in Indian population thus, has personal meaning {{and there is no}} common agreement on it. Materials and Methods: With the help of semi-structured questionnaire, we surveyed the sexual activity, sexual beliefs and past sexual experiences of those <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation (n = 62) and compared them with an age-matched control (n = 50). Results: Those <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation expected more number of strokes (39. 1 vs. 32. 6) in lesser time (11. 5 min vs. 16. 3) during sexual encounters i. e. more rapid thrusting. Significantly more of those <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation felt that masturbation was not a normal activity and that both male and female partners must climax simultaneously for satisfactory sexual experience. Also, significantly more of those <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation reported their first sexual experience to be unsatisfactory. Conclusion: In the cultural context of India, those <b>seeking</b> <b>treatment</b> for early ejaculation may be distressed due to their inability to meet their own expectations in addition to distress of inability to hold ejaculation as desired. It is essential to re-educate such individuals before considering the diagnosis of PME. Various diagnostic criteria for PME have not emphasized the exclusion of cultural factors as contributors to distress of PME...|$|R
