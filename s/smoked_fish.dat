25|$|Cheese flies – Family Piophilidae - Most are {{scavengers}} {{in animal}} products and fungi. The best-known {{member of the}} family is Piophila casei. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, <b>smoked</b> <b>fish,</b> cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly iridescent and lie flat upon the fly's abdomen when at rest. At four mm (1/6inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common housefly.|$|E
