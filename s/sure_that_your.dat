500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying {{that one of the}} things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E

He did threaten to kill me and I said to him: 'Well, you'd better make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> assassin gets me first because, if he misses, you better know I won't miss you.' He could be a complete pig, you know. He could charm the birds out of the trees, but {{he could be a}} brute." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{one must}} {{be very careful about}} how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not {{sufficient}} to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively [...] "Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor," [...] (Proverbs 22:22) and from Talmudic-era commentaries including Numbers Rabba 5:2. It is taught that Tzedakah money was never yours to begin with, rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I came to you, sir," [...] the {{official}} replied, [...] "because I have {{the privilege of}} knowing you personally, and because I was quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> in <b>your</b> hands the matter would be treated wisely." ...|$|R
2500|$|Grandmaster (GM) John Nunn adds a caveat: when {{in a bad}} position, {{one must}} decide between two strategies, which he calls [...] "grim [...] " [...] and [...] "create confusion." [...] "Grim defence" [...] {{involves}} finding some way to hang on, often by liquidating to an ending. [...] "Create confusion" [...] entails trying to [...] "gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong." [...] Nunn cautions that, [...] "If you decide to go for 'create confusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early to give yourself a reasonable chance of success. However, you should be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, {{it is far more}} common to panic too early than too late." ...|$|E
60|$|THE EMPEROR. There is {{something}} in that: there is certainly something in that--if only I could feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> brother would not fret.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be nervous about it, for unless there is some dark horse I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Rosney has got the race in hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Courage," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{obliged to}} you for all this care; but I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>your</b> inner consciousness, you realize as I do that it is sheer waste of time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't much care," [...] Virginia answered. [...] "I {{have a sort}} {{of feeling}} in my throat that I want--some one to kiss me. You're quite, quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever}} <b>your</b> aunt may say you will never regret this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I share <b>your</b> satisfaction, old fellow," [...] {{said the}} painter ruefully; but he {{unpacked}} the sketches.|$|R
6000|$|L. There is no {{occasion}} for understanding it; {{but do you}} feel it? Are you <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it, yes," [...] I answered, looking into my lover's handsome, glowing face. [...] "You are <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> mother will not mind--that she approves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> maid agrees," [...] John laughed. [...] "She seemed rather horrified {{when she}} {{found that there was}} no woman servant about the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, my dear boy, prosper {{and keep}} you! I know enough {{of you to}} be <b>sure</b> <b>that,</b> {{whatever}} <b>your</b> course may be, you will bear yourself as a true gentleman, worthy of your father and of the name you bear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! A continuosity? I {{know what}} that is in the {{ordinary}} acceptation of the term, but I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I follow <b>your</b> meaning exactly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} feel with me--and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> with <b>your</b> {{excellent}} judgment it {{is a thing}} of course--that everything must be over between you and Lady Clara." [...] And then she came to a full stop as though all had been said that could be considered necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "As far as I can learn, {{they never}} really {{suspected}} him until after your answer had come. They {{had been quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> answer {{would be in the}} affirmative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cecil," [...] he said, [...] "are you quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{guests are}} worth the trouble you have taken to {{entertain}} them? I refer more particularly to the two men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! It was Gabe Werner's fault entirely! That boy ought {{really to}} be in jail! But, Jack, you are quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> eyes are all right?" [...] she went on anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hastings reflectively, [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>your</b> duty to put {{ideas into}} her mind when you can't be quite certain that she has entertained them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "there {{were little}} courtesies shown us at Las Palmas, {{things that made}} our stay there pleasanter, and I think there was, perhaps, no great reason why you should have done them for my father." [...] Then her eyes twinkled. [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> all <b>your</b> friends were very pleased with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, too, Lechmere. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> all <b>your</b> {{old friends}} {{will give you}} as hearty a welcome as they will give me. Indeed, {{it ought to be}} a good deal heartier, for you have been living among them all your life, while I have been away for the most part ever since I was a boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{father will}} do me the justice {{to say that}} I said nothing that could in any way be {{construed}} into such an opinion, Miss Hawtrey,' he replied, courteously.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, we {{all hope}} that Mr. Graham won't die--at any rate not at present. If there be any danger you may be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> papa will send for the best advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rachel said no more, {{but when}} she was gone upstairs Mr. Clare {{detained}} his nephew to say, [...] "I beg your pardon, Alick, but you should be quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> wife likes this proposal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chief Strom's {{philosophy}} for {{enforcing the}} law reflected his respect for individual rights. SLED Agents to this day carry cards bearing Strom's credo: [...] "Make sure a man is guilty before you affect his reputation, his freedom, or his pocketbook.

6000|$|... "Evidently," [...] said I, [...] "Mr. Wilson's {{assistant}} {{counts for}} a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you inquired <b>your</b> way merely in order that you might see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are," [...] Virginia answered, [...] "and {{you may be}} very {{thankful for}} it. I {{do not know whether}} it was wise of me or not, but I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I saved <b>your</b> life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “If it’s furs that you’re out for,” said Eleanor, “you {{will have}} to superintend the choice of them in person. You can’t be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> cousin knows the {{difference}} between silver-fox and ordinary squirrel.” ...|$|E
6000|$|What I did do, {{was to try}} {{and gain}} time by {{questioning}} her. [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> friend in London will receive you at such a late hour as this?" [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The drive will be pleasant," [...] he said, [...] "especially if it {{is through}} such country as this. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I regret <b>your</b> mistake, Harrison. You will remain and bring the baggage on, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? I {{caught a}} glimpse of your coat through the window, and I felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I knew <b>your</b> coat. Have you seen Katharine or William? I'm {{wandering}} about Lincoln looking for the ruins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' assented Jenny, {{screwing}} up {{her mouth with}} an appearance of conviction. 'Yes, to be <b>sure!</b> <b>That</b> accounts for <b>your</b> having so much time to give to interceding. But only to think how kind and friendly a gentleman you must be!' ...|$|R
