Four cannons were eventually installed in 1910, surrounding the monument, but these were removed during the Second World War (1939–1945) for scrap metal to help the war effort. The need for scrap metal fell and they were eventually buried at Watchet. The one cannon remaining at Exeter was brought to the monument in 1977 and finally installed in 1984.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Geographically {{distributed}} {{storage is}} an important method of ensuring high data availability in cloud computing and storage systems. With the increasing demand for moving file systems to the cloud, current methods of providing such enterprise-grade resiliency are very inefficient. For example, replication based methods incur large <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> though they provide low access latencies. While erasure coded schemes reduce <b>storage</b> <b>cost,</b> they are associated with large access latencies and high bandwidth cost. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named CAROM, an ensemble of replication and erasure codes, to provide resiliency in cloud file systems with high efficiency. Whilemaintainingthesame consistencysemantics seen in today’s cloud file systems, CAROM provides the benefit of low bandwidth <b>cost,</b> low <b>storage</b> <b>cost,</b> and low access latencies. We perform a large-scale evaluation using real-world file system traces and demonstrate that CAROM outperforms replication based schemes in <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> by up to 60 % and erasure coded schemes in bandwidth cost by up to 43 %, while maintaining low access latencies close to those in replication based schemes.

25|$|In {{a similar}} way as with {{synthetic}} alcohol production, hydrogen {{can be used on}} site to directly (nonbiologically) produce greenhouse-neutral gaseous fuels. Thus, captive-hydrogen-mediated production of greenhouse-neutral methane has been proposed (note that this is the reverse of the present method of acquiring hydrogen from natural methane, but one that does not require ultimate burning and release of fossil fuel carbon). Captive hydrogen (and carbon dioxide from, for example, CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage)) may be used onsite to synthesize methane, using the Sabatier reaction. This is about 60% efficient, and with the round trip reducing to 20 to 36% depending on the method of fuel utilization. This is even lower than hydrogen, but the <b>storage</b> <b>costs</b> drop by at least a factor of 3, because of methane's higher boiling point and higher energy density. Liquid methane has 3.2 times the energy density of liquid hydrogen and is easier to store compactly. Additionally, the pipe infrastructure (natural gas pipelines) are already in place. Natural-gas-powered vehicles already exist, and are known to be easier to adapt from existing internal engine technology, than internal combustion autos running directly on hydrogen. Experience with natural gas powered vehicles shows that methane storage is inexpensive, once one has accepted the cost of conversion to store the fuel. However, the cost of alcohol storage is even lower, so this technology would need to produce methane at a considerable savings with regard to alcohol production. Ultimate mature prices of fuels in the competing technologies are not presently known, but both are expected to offer substantial infrastructural savings over attempts to transport and use hydrogen directly.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} attempt at characterizing reading {{difficulty}} in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path dura-tion, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, {{and an increase in}} word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi-culty, integration and <b>storage</b> <b>cost,</b> have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures.

Nuclear power stations typically have high capital costs, but low direct fuel costs, with the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and spent fuel storage internalized costs. Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods {{is strongly dependent on}} assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear stations. Cost estimates take into account station decommissioning and nuclear waste storage or recycling costs in the United States due to the Price Anderson Act. With the prospect that all spent nuclear fuel/"nuclear waste" [...] could potentially be recycled by using future reactors, generation IV reactors are being designed to completely close the nuclear fuel cycle. [...] Presently, however there has not yet been any actual bulk recycling of waste from a NPP, and on-site temporary storage is still being used at almost all plant sites due to waste repository construction problems.

2500|$|CO2 {{has been}} {{injected}} into declining oil fields {{for more than}} 40 years, to increase oil recovery. [...] This option is attractive because the <b>storage</b> <b>costs</b> are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 10–15% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that {{is available from the}} oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO2 into Oil fields is that CO2 is soluble in oil. [...] Dissolving CO2 in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its interfacial tension which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration. [...] Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.|$|E

When compared with the traditional replication based schemes, erasure codes have the potential of significantly lowering <b>storage</b> and communication <b>costs</b> while simultaneously guaranteeing the desired resiliency levels. In this work, we propose the Storage-Optimized Data-Atomic (SODA) algorithm for implementing atomic memory objects in the multi-writer multi-reader setting. SODA uses Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, and is specifically designed to optimize the total <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> for a given fault-tolerance requirement. For tolerating f server crashes in an n-server system, SODA uses an [n, k] MDS code with k = n - f, and incurs a total <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> of n/n-f. SODA is designed under the assumption of reliable point-to-point communication channels. The communication cost of a write and a read operation are respectively given by O(f[superscript 2]) and n/n-f(δ[subscript w]+ 1), where δ[subscript w] denotes the number of writes that are concurrent with the particular read. In comparison with the recent CASGC algorithm [1], which also uses MDS codes, SODA offers lower <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> while pays more on the communication cost. We also present a modification of SODA, called SODA[subscript err], to handle the case where some of the servers can return erroneous coded elements during a read operation. Specifically, in order to tolerate f server failures and e error-prone coded elements, the SODAerr algorithm uses an [n, k] MDS code such that k = n - 2 e - f.
