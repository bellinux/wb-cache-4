40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the exact}} {{analyses}} are presented for the plane {{problem of a}} coating material subjected to a concentrated force acting at {{the interior of the}} substrate and the case when the force at the interface. The <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> are constructed as an infinite series form by utilizing the method of image. According to the orders of the image points from lower to higher, the terms in the <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> series have the recursive relationships. For the case when the force acting at the substrate, the first two terms are the original <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> for a homogenous infinite plane subjected to a concentrated force, which are known and simple. For the case when the force acting at the interface, the fundamental solution is obtained for two bonded dissimilar semi-infinite plane. The <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> in this solution can be used as the first two terms for the problem considered in this paper. Therefore, all other terms can be derived by the recurrence equations explicitly. Also, through comparisons between the theoretical results and the numerical results by FEM, it is verified that the convergence rate of the solutions is very rapid. In most practical cases only the first several image points can ensure the solutions with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{boundary}} collocation {{method is}} developed for analyzing cracked thin plates. Complex <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> which satisfy the equilibrium equations of an infinite domain having a single crack are first derived. As the functions have also satisfied the stress singularity {{at the crack}} tips, it is only necessary to enforce the <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> to satisfy the boundary conditions {{along the edges of}} the plates and the surfaces of the cracks, if {{there is more than one}} crack. This is achieved by the collocation least square approach. The unknown coefficients of the <b>stress</b> <b>functions</b> having been determined, the stress intensity factors can then be computed according to the related formulae. Examples of rectangular and circular plates with a different number of cracks and under different loadings are used to demonstrate the accuracy, versatility and advantages of the method. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
