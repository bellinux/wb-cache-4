40|$|We {{present a}} {{complete}} {{design of a}} multi channels PID controller for Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) using a pulse width modulation (PWM) technique implemented by a dedicated programmable logic device (PLD) programmed by VHDL. The PID control loop is implemented by software written by National Instrument Lab-Windows CVI. Due {{to the fact that}} the implementation is by a VHDL and PLD the design is modular, as a result, the circuit is very compact in size and very low cost as compared to any commercial product. In addition, since the control loop is implemented by software running on a personal computer (PC) using a C language, it is easy to adjust the controller to various environmental conditions and for a width range of sensors like: a thermo couple (TC), thermistor, resistance temperature detectors (RTD) etc. We demonstrate the performance of this circuit as a controller for a <b>small</b> <b>incubator</b> using thermistor as the temperature sensor...|$|E
40|$|Coucke (1998) was {{the first}} to use {{acoustic}} resonance analysis to monitor embryo development in chicken eggs. He remarked that at around 100 hours of incubation, the course of the resonant frequency and damping changed abruptly in the case of fertile eggs. He also showed that these changes were related to a physiologic event during early embryonic development. The objective of our study is to monitor the course of the vibration parameters during the early incubation of chicken eggs and to relate these changes to egg and embryo characteristics. A total of 72 Hybro eggs were incubated vertically in a <b>small</b> <b>incubator</b> at standard conditions. Several egg parameters were measured before incubation. During the early stages of incubation the vibration behavior of these eggs was monitored. The time at which the damping of the vibration suddenly changed, the diameter of the eggs and their interaction were found to be significant explanatory variables in order to predict hatching time.

40|$|A {{simple method}} of growing chick em-bryos in beakers {{up to an}} age of eight days is described. An {{analysis}} {{of the effect of}} incubator types, beaker size and transparent cover-ing materials on the survival of embryos grown in vitro was made. Results indicated tha t the embryos grown in 100 ml. beakers had significantly longer survival time than those in the 50 ml. beakers. A small forced draft incuba-tor (Lyons) gave significantly better re-sults than the commercial forced draft in-cubator or the commercial forced draft incubator used in these trials. This was probably due to less vibration in the <b>small</b> <b>incubator</b> than existed in the commercial forced draft incubator. The investigation of several different beaker covering films indicated that this material must retard moisture loss and yet have a high gas transmission rate. Handi-Wrap and Saran-Wrap were significantly superior to the other covering materials tested although Trycite appears to warrant further inves-tigation.

30|$|Data on 105 {{spin-off}} firms {{were collected in}} 2006 / 2007. The selection of {{spin-off firms}} took place using the criteria of existing in 2006 and being no older than 10  years. All firms in the population (150) were approached for the interview, with an overall response rate of 70  % (105 firms). Note that excluding non-survivors {{might have been a}} source of bias; however, it appeared that mortality rates among university spin-off firms are relatively low. Mustar et al. (2008) in a European study suggest that 75  % survived after 6  years, whereas local experts in Delft even suggest an 85  % survival rate (personal communication). This situation made us believe that representativeness of the sample for the population at the two universities is not a major concern. The face-to-face interview, using a semi-structured questionnaire, took 50 to 90  min, to obtain a good impression of the networks addressed at the firm’s level and of the socio-economic background of the partners. Several pilot interviews were conducted first, with the finding that the respondents would be better able to provide precise details about important networks partners if the maximum size of the networks is set at five persons. The network, as it was measured, is also limited to the ego-network. We are also dealing with early networks, meaning that most probably the spin-offs are in a process of moving away from small social circle-based networks (partners at university from pre-start times, <b>small</b> <b>incubator</b> firms, friends) to including new arm’s length relations like with (launching) customers and suppliers, and potentially adopting a stronger mediator role (Hite and Hesterley 2001).|$|E
40|$|Creative Industries {{was adopted}} as a {{platform}} in the 90 s by the Blair government in the UK to describe the convergence of the arts, media, communication and information technologies as a newly formed cluster, providing economic and cultural capital for the knowledge economy. The philosophy and rhetoric which has grown around this concept (Leadbeater 2000, Castells 2000, Florida 2000, Caves 2000, Hartley 2000) has been influential in re-contextualising culture and {{the arts in the}} 21 st century. Where governments and educational institutions have embraced the context of the creative industries, it is having a profound effect on the way arts are being positioned, originally as ‘creative content’ for the new economy. Countries and regions which have actively targeted the Creative Industries as an important economic growth factor in a post-industrial environment are numerous, but {{it is interesting to note}} that North and South East Asia and Australia have been at the forefront of developing the Creative Industries in its various guises. It could be argued that the initial phase of Creative Industries concentrated on media and communication technologies to provide commercial outcomes in <b>small</b> <b>incubator</b> business models; developing, for example, products for the games industry. Creative Industries is now entering a second phase of development; one in which the broader palette of the arts, though still not at the forefront of debate, is being re-examined. Both phases of Creative Industries have emphasised creativity and innovation as key drivers in the success and effectiveness of this sector, and although the arts by no means has a monopoly on these drivers, it is where they have an important part to play in the creative industries context. Arguably, the second wave of the creative industries acknowledges to a greater extent that commercialisation works in tandem with government and other support in a complex mixed economic model. In relation to the performing arts, the global market has seen an increase in large-scale cultural events such as festivals which are providing employment for the arts industry and multiplier effects in other parts of the economy. Differentiated product is important in this competitive arena and the use of mediated and digitised environments has been able to increase the amount of arts product available to an international market. This changed environment requires the development of new skills for our artists and producers and has given rise to a reappraisal of approaches to arts training and research in the Higher Degree Education sector (Brown 2007, Cunningham 2006). This paper examines pedagogical changes which took place in the first Creative Industries Faculty in the world at Queensland University of Technology as well as the increased opportunities for leading research initiatives. It concludes with the example of an interdisciplinary artwork produced in a creative industries precinct, exemplifying the convergence of arts and communication technologies and that of artistic practice and research. ...|$|E
