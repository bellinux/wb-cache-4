5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and <b>search</b> <b>out</b> suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier to <b>search</b> <b>out</b> {{an eastern}} route to Asia, {{the city of}} Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to <b>search</b> <b>out</b> others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E

5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They <b>search</b> <b>out</b> holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Monolith Soft {{and published by}} Namco (Namco Bandai Games in North America) for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. It is the final entry in both the Xenosaga trilogy and the larger Xenosaga series, which forms part of the Xeno franchise. Concluding the narrative of Xenosaga Episode I and Episode II, Episode III sees Shion Uzuki and the battle android KOS-MOS <b>search</b> <b>out</b> {{the origins of the}} hostile alien Gnosis while being hunted by Shion's former employers and four powerful humans called the Testaments. Gameplay is carried over from the first two games, featuring exploration of environments through a linear narrative, while battles follow a turn-based system featuring multiple leveling systems and combat with both a human party and mecha.|$|E
5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to <b>search</b> <b>out</b> a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid larva – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, coccinellids usually {{begin to}} appear indoors {{in the autumn}} when they leave their summer feeding sites in fields, forests, and yards and <b>search</b> <b>out</b> places to spend the winter. Typically, when {{temperatures}} warm to the mid-60s F (around 18°C) in the late afternoon, following a period of cooler weather, they will swarm onto or into buildings illuminated by the sun. Swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in September through November depending on location and weather conditions. Homes or other buildings near fields or woods are particularly prone to infestation.|$|E
25|$|At an 1888 {{convention}} of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers that was held in Richmond, Virginia, delegates organized a special committee to <b>search</b> <b>out</b> hiding places that might be used by labor spies.

25|$|Parasitoid wasps that parasitize tessaratomids {{usually come}} from the {{families}} Eupelmidae, Scelionidae, and Encyrtidae. Adult female parasitoid wasps will <b>search</b> <b>out</b> eggs laid by tessaratomoids. Upon finding some, they will thrust their ovipositors into them and lay eggs inside. The eggs of parasitoid wasps hatch and develop inside the tessaratomid eggs, feeding on the tessaratomid embryo and eventually killing it. Infested eggs characteristically turn darker in color as the wasp larva matures. After about a week, one or more adult wasps will then emerge from the now empty egg.|$|E

Some among the followers of Siyyid Kázim expected that Mullá Husayn would declare himself to be the Mahdi, or at least take up leadrship of the Shaykis; he forcefully refuted both suggestions.|$|E
25|$|USS Ferret was a two masted schooner, {{the third}} U.S. Navy vessel to bear this name, and was {{purchased}} 20 December 1822 at Baltimore, Maryland and commissioned early in 1823, with Lieutenant R.

Ferret served transporting U.S. sailors, marines and supplies to the pirate infested waters of the Caribbean and was used to <b>search</b> <b>out</b> and attack pirate ships and pirate strongholds {{for a little more}} than two years when her career was cut short when the vessel capsized in a gale force storm off the coast of Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Oppositely, {{there are}} myths {{with a similar}} plot, but a {{different}} role for the characters.

However, in the Danggeum Aegi myth, Danggeum Aegi becomes the goddess of childbirth, and her sons become the gods of life. In the Nogadanpungjajimyeong myth, Queen Nogadanpungjajimyeong becomes the goddess of luck, and her sons become the Underworld gods.|$|E
