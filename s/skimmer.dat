5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil <b>skimmer</b> vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the <b>skimmer</b> back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black <b>skimmer,</b> brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe <b>skimmer</b> dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies {{are found}} on every {{continent}} except Antarctica. In {{contrast to the}} damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are found across continents. For example, the blue-eyed darner Rhionaeschna multicolor is found all across North America, and in Central America; emperors Anax are found throughout the Americas from {{as far north as}} Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina, across Europe to central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The globe <b>skimmer</b> Pantala flavescens is probably the most widespread dragonfly species in the world; it is cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with far fewer species in temperate regions.|$|E
5|$|At {{school the}} {{following}} day, {{the town is}} stunned by Colin's death. Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool <b>skimmer</b> by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver penny of John from the early 13thcentury. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), and part of a <b>skimmer</b> that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12horseshoes.|$|E
5000|$|Effectiveness with {{chemicals}} in the water: Oleophilic <b>skimmers</b> may not work as effectively if there are detergents, cleaners or other surfactants in the water that interfere with the oleophilic attraction. Weir <b>skimmers</b> are not affected by chemicals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skimmers</b> made {{entirely of}} {{stainless}} steel are {{the best choice for}} use in the kitchen, since wooden-handled <b>skimmers</b> have a tendency to soak up liquids as the handle is exposed to hot water or oil. This allows growth of bacteria that could result in a food-borne illness.|$|R
50|$|Inland skimboarding {{emerged in}} the mid 1970s and {{has its roots in}} Sacramento, California. With {{homemade}} skimboards made of plywood, fiberglass and resin, <b>skimmers</b> were sliding on sandbars along the American and Sacramento rivers. Most <b>skimmers</b> back then were just doing headstands, multi-360 spins and 180 shuvits for tricks.|$|R

25|$|N. papillator is soft bodied, {{covered with}} small spines and has six legs. John C. Conroy {{examined}} 13 males and 43 females, and recorded mean male lengths of 0.46mm (range: 0.397-0.504mm) and mean female lengths of 0.563mm (range: 0.525-0.641mm); Ruth Marshall's original description differed slightly with {{males and females}} recorded as 0.6 and 0.78mm respectively. It has been recorded {{at a depth of}} 5 metres. Larvae of the Eastern forktail damselfly (Ischnura verticalis), larvae of <b>skimmer</b> dragonflies in the genus Libellula and adult water mites of the genus Limnesia have all been observed predating N. papillator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aperture}} {{visible from}} the pool side is typically 1' 0" [...] (300 mm) wide by 6" [...] (150 mm) high, which intersects the water midway though {{the center of the}} aperture. <b>Skimmers</b> with apertures wider than this are termed [...] "wide angle" [...] <b>skimmers</b> and may be as much as 2' 0" [...] wide (600 mm). Floating <b>skimmers</b> have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of pump suction and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. <b>Skimmers</b> should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{availability}} of production-made boards, inland <b>skimmers</b> just made their own wood boards from scratch. The boards back then were a classic tear-drop or tombstone shape. Current designs and constructions have not changed much, but the new shape preference for most inland <b>skimmers</b> is a twin-tip or symmetrical shaped board.|$|R

500|$|Surface feeding {{itself can}} be broken up into two {{different}} approaches, surface feeding while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds and storm petrels), and surface feeding while swimming (examples of which are practiced by fulmars, gulls, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels). Surface feeders in flight include {{some of the most}} acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigate-birds and some terns), or [...] "walk", pattering and hovering on the water's surface, as some of the storm-petrels do. Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so. Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the <b>skimmer,</b> which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water—this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. The skimmer's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one.|$|E

2500|$|SBVT's {{claims about}} the {{incident}} are primarily based on an account by retired Rear Admiral William Schachte, then a lieutenant. Schachte has stated that he regularly led training missions for recently arrived officers such as Kerry. One tactic described by Schachte was for a Swift Boat to tow the <b>skimmer</b> to the target area and wait nearby. [...] The <b>skimmer,</b> manned by three people, [...] "would go in, draw fire and get out immediately." [...] The waiting Swift Boats or air support would attack the enemies thus detected.
