Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996.

Generally reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street, with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as [...] "No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent". Zuel described it as [...] "Powderfinger's first dull album" [...] but the band as [...] "the biggest rock band in the country."

500|$|Michigan {{entered the}} game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Media outlets {{projected}} the team as favorites to win the Big Ten conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle Jake Long, tailback Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, each of whom had decided to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> rather than declare eligibility for the NFL Draft. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival Ohio State and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. Mark Schlabach of ESPN.com stated that [...] ", along with receivers Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could potentially {{be one of the}} most explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as captains, along with linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. [...] Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver formation, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that [...] "when you have some of the skill that we have at the wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [...] positive." [...] At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and defensive linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was [...] "loaded in speed".|$|E
