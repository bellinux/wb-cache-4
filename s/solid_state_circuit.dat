30|$|In Fig.  13, {{the natural}} current {{crossing}} {{point of the}} inverter fault current appeared at 1.0018  s. The progress of the DC circuit breaker included detection, looking up the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker database, and the auxiliary switching action. Therefore, the waiting time for the DC breaker to act is the setting time minus the delay times caused by detection and looking up the database. The simulation, detection, looking-up the database and {{the action of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker were treated as instantaneous, namely, they were completed within one simulation step that ranged from 10  μs to 50  μs. In this model, the setting time was 0.0018  s. Thus, a delay of 0.0018  s tripped the fast DC breaker. At the same time, the hybrid DC breaker was also tripped. After 1.2  s, the system reached a stable state again.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker for the {{improvement}} of transient stability margin. Long distance AC transmission is often subject to stability problems, which limits the transmission capability. Interconnected power systems suffer from weakly damped swings between synchronous generator and sub systems. The development of modern power system has lead to an increasing complexity in the study of power system and also presents new challenges to power system stability and in particular to the aspects of transient stability and small signal stability. Transient stability control plays a significant role in ensuring the stable operation of power systems in the event of large disturbances and faults and is thus a significant area of research. This study investigates the improvement of transient stability of a two area system, using <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> Breaker which is capable of fast switching in case of faults and thus controlling the real and reactive power flows in a faulted transmission line. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment for two area system model with <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> Breaker to analyze the effects of SSCB on transient stability performance of the system. From the simulation results, swing curves of the three phase faulted power system without SSCB gets increases monotonically and thus the system can be considered as unstable whereas the swing curves of the system with an SSCB reaches to a steady state...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} implementation of <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> Breaker in power system using MOSFET. The high power semiconductor switches {{can be used to}} separate the faulty portions {{from the rest of the}} power system in case of abnormal conditions. The <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Circuit</b> Breaker is a topology made in the form of module, can protect power system and its components from faults. Existing mechanical circuit breakers are based on the principle of magnetically latching a pair of mechanical contacts shrouded by an arc chute for arc extinction. Very often unnecessary tripping results from a phenomenon known as, “rapid rise” which subsequently results in the demand for frequent maintenance. Due to the long turn-off delay of the present mechanical circuit breaker, significant voltage sag is experienced in the grid which affects the sensible loads. The distortions caused by the three phase short circuit can be reduced to 100 µs in the system with SSCB, in contrast to 100 ms achieved by the present technology and hence it improves the power quality. The SSCB uses high power anti parallel switches to carry bidirectional current. The load voltage is sensed and it is used to turn on and turn off the SSCB. The Eight bus system with SSCB is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The hardware model is developed for implementation of SSCB using MOSFETand it is tested in the laboratory...|$|E

Nevertheless, further improvement of the conduction properties by increasing the doping concentration in the p-type channel region has to be carried out. Furthermore, it is determined that for {{a clear understanding of}} the temperature dependency of the output characteristic, further investigations concerning the influence of the incomplete ionization, ambipolar lifetime, and emitter efficiency are mandatory...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecently, {{solid state}} DC circuit breaker (SSCB) using {{normally-on}} SiC-JFET offers a great protection device for DC microgrid {{due to its}} fast response time (in tens of microseconds) and low on-state losses. At the simulation stage, an appropriate model of the SiC-JFET should be built in order to reflect correctly behaviors of the breaker during faults and clearing faults processes. For instance, the fault clearing time should be in tens of microseconds. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel model for commercial normally-on SiC-JFET in <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker application. The parameters of the model are first extracted from the SiC-JFET experimental data. Afterward, the operation of a SiC-JFET in a prototype of solid state breaker is evaluated by comparing the static and dynamic characteristics of SiC-JFET model, which is simulated in Matlab/Simulink, to the experimental measurement. Good agreement between simulation and experiment has been achieved and confirms the validity of the built model of the SiC JFET...|$|E
