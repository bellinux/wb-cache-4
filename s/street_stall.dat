25|$|The chindonya had {{a revival}} again between 1946 and 1956, and between 1950 and 1960 there {{were up to}} 2,500 chindon'ya active in Japan. They often {{performed}} on black markets. Many stores also moved from a <b>street</b> <b>stall</b> to fixed locations, generating business for chindon'ya, as did {{the rise of the}} pachinko business. One well known group in Osaka was Aozora Gakudan, founded by former actor Saeki Yosan. This group played with up to 18 members, and many other chindon'ya joined this group. The introduction of TV and radio advertising had only a small effect on the chindon'ya, as these new mediums were too expensive for the small shops that used the chindon'ya services, and not targeted enough for the customers living nearby the stores.|$|E
500|$|Xiaochi: Xiaochi (...) are {{forms of}} Chinese street food {{and serve as}} {{substantial}} snacks, which could be eaten together or with more substantial dishes like the Spanish tapas or Middle Eastern Levantine meze, or alone as a light meal or snack like the French [...] Typically, they are most commonly served by outlets ranging from market stalls to teahouses and restaurants in areas of heavy pedestrian traffic: for example near temples and markets in the commercial centres of Chinese towns and cities. The so-called [...] "four great xiaochi clusters" [...] of mainland China are all based around temples: Taiwanese food critic Shu Kuo-chih describes xiaochi as [...] "food from a <b>street</b> <b>stall,</b> shop or even a restaurant that comes in small portions and could never be considered a 'square meal' on its own. In New York, he says, 'hot dogs or nachos could be xiaochi.' Dim sum? Definitely." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{possible}} fathers of the hamburger is Charlie Nagreen (1871–1951) of Seymour, Wisconsin, who {{at the age of}} 15 sold Hamburg steaks from a <b>street</b> <b>stall</b> at the annual Outagamie County Fair. Nagreen said he began by selling Hamburg steaks, but these did not have much success because people wanted to freely move around the festival without the need to eat them at his stand. In response to this, in 1885 Nagreen decided to flatten the hamburger steak and insert it between two slices of bread, so that the public could move freely from booth to booth while eating his sandwich, an innovation that was well received by his customers. This became known as the [...] "Hamburger Charlie", and Nagreen's creation was sold at the festival until his death in 1951. To this day, his accomplishment is celebrated annually with a [...] "Burger Fest" [...] in his honor in his hometown of Seymour.|$|E
50|$|Food {{markets in}} Thailand, large open air halls with {{permanent}} stalls, tend {{to operate as}} a collection of <b>street</b> <b>stalls,</b> each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as <b>street</b> <b>stalls,</b> both pre-cooked as well as made to order.

2500|$|In October 2007, {{an article}} in the Los Angeles Times stated that, [...] "Dishwashers, waiters and others whose jobs and {{dilapidated}} home addresses seem to make them unpromising targets for political fundraisers are pouring $1,000 and $2,000 contributions into Clinton's campaign treasury. In April, a single fundraiser in an area long known for its gritty urban poverty yielded a whopping $380,000." [...] The Times further stated, [...] "At this point in the presidential campaign cycle, Clinton has raised more money than any candidate in history. Those dishwashers, waiters and <b>street</b> <b>stall</b> hawkers are part of the reason. And Clinton's success in gathering money from Chinatown's least-affluent residents stems from a two-pronged strategy: mutually beneficial alliances with powerful groups, and appeals to the hopes and dreams of people now consigned to the margins." [...] The New York Post reported similar findings. [...] The Washington Post editorialized that reports such as these appear [...] "to be another instance in which a Clinton campaign's zeal for campaign cash overwhelms its judgment," [...] comparing it to the 1996 Clinton-Gore finance controversy of her husband.|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{activities}} using {{public space}} are attracting attention across Japan. Fukuoka City {{is the top}} street-stall city in the country. There are more than 150 <b>street</b> food <b>stalls</b> in public spaces such as streets and parks, with which the citizens have been familiar for many years {{since the end of}} World War II. The stalls are an example of using public space while substantially contributing to the local economy. Moreover, analyze of the economic impact proves that <b>street</b> food <b>stalls</b> play a significant role for customers. The management of <b>street</b> <b>stalls,</b> however, has a lot of issues to be settled, in terms of hygiene or traffic. Among others, costs to rent public spaces need to be re-examined. This study revealed that if ground rents are based on market prices, a monthly fee of 18, 000 yen to 30, 000 yen per <b>street</b> food <b>stall</b> is regarded as appropriate. In addition, <b>street</b> <b>stalls</b> are not equipped with toilets or sewerage facilities.
