This thesis presents experimental investigations for the failure of a <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> of a coal-fired power plant using several failure analysis procedures. The failure analysis comprised of visual inspection, optical microscopic, scanning electron microscopy combined with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXD). A sample of a total-fractured <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> obtained from an industry was used in this investigation. Initial visual investigations found that the <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> had a longitudinal crack. This fracture appearance is called fish mouth stress rupture. The specimen was initially cut, mounted, grinded, polished and etched. A significant oxide layer of 1. 75 mm in thickness was occurred in the steam side surface. The optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to identify intergranular cracks, voids, elongated grain and deposit layers. The EDS and EDXD were used to identify types and compositions of the oxide substances. The results revealed that the steam and fire side surfaces consist of sodium iron oxide, hematite and magnetite. The study also demonstrates that the <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> of a coal-fired failed due to creep mechanism.

The application of superheated boiler tube includes {{a sequence of}} events such as fluctuating stress levels at constant temperature, fluctuating temperature levels at constant stress, and periods during which both stress and temperature are simultaneously fluctuating. This is supported by evidence indicating that the thermal cycling and creep processes interact to produce a synergistic response. In this study creep test was carried out at temperature 5500 C with constant stress 333. 3 MPa, and creep-thermal cycling test was generated by constant stress during hold periods at maximum temperature 5500 C and at minimum temperature 4200 C on low alloy steel with Grade 360 BS 3059. The samples were held at minimum temperature in two different media; in a furnace and in air respectively.

However this method for processing refuse has produces pollutants such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrochloride (HCl) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2).

40|$|This report {{broadens}} {{a previous}} review of published literature on corrosion of recovery boiler <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> materials {{to consider the}} performance of candidate materials at temperatures near the deposit melting temperature in advanced boilers firing coal, wood-based fuels, and waste materials {{as well as in}} gas turbine environments. Discussions of corrosion mechanisms focus on the reactions in fly ash deposits and combustion gases that can give corrosive materials access to the surface of a <b>superheater</b> <b>tube.</b> Setting the steam temperature of a biomass boiler is a compromise between wasting fuel energy, risking pluggage that will shut the unit down, and creating conditions that will cause rapid corrosion on the superheater tubes and replacement expenses. The most important corrosive species in biomass superheater corrosion are chlorine compounds and the most corrosion resistant alloys are typically FeCrNi alloys containing 20 - 28 % Cr. Although most of these materials contain many other additional additions, there is no coherent theory of the alloying required to resist the combination of high temperature salt deposits and flue gases that are found in biomass boiler superheaters that may cause degradation of superheater tubes. After depletion of chromium by chromate formation or chromic acid volatilization exceeds a critical amount, the protective scale gives way to a thick layer of Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } over an unprotective (FeCrNi) {sub 3 }O{sub 4 } spinel. This oxide is not protective and can be penetrated by chlorine species that cause further acceleration of the corrosion rate by a mechanism called active oxidation. Active oxidation, cited as the cause of most biomass superheater corrosion under chloride ash deposits, does not occur in the absence of these alkali salts when the chloride is present as HCl gas. Although a deposit is more corrosive at temperatures where it is molten than at temperatures where it is frozen, increasing <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> temperatures through the measured first melting point of fly ash deposits does not necessarily produce a step increase in corrosion rate. Corrosion rate typically accelerates at temperatures below the first melting temperature and mixed deposits may have a broad melting temperature range. Although the environment at a <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> surface is initially that of the ash deposits, this chemistry typically changes as the deposits mature. The corrosion rate is controlled by the environment and temperature at the tube surface, which can only be measured indirectly. Some results are counter-intuitive. Two boiler manufacturers and a consortium have developed models to predict fouling and corrosion in biomass boilers in order to specify tube materials for particular operating conditions. It would be very useful to compare the predictions of these models regarding corrosion rates and recommended alloys in the boiler environments where field tests will be performed in the current program. Manufacturers of biomass boilers have concluded that it is more cost-effective to restrict steam temperatures, to co-fire biofuels with high sulfur fuels and/or to use fuel additives rather than try to increase fuel efficiency by operating with <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> temperatures above melting temperature of fly ash deposits. Similar strategies have been developed for coal fired and waste-fired boilers. Additives are primarily used to replace alkali metal chloride deposits with higher melting temperature and less corrosive alkali metal sulfate or alkali aluminum silicate deposits. Design modifications that have been shown to control superheater corrosion include adding a radiant pass (empty chamber) between the furnace and the superheater, installing cool tubes immediately upstream of the superheater to trap high chloride deposits, designing superheater banks for quick replacement, using an external superheater that burns a less corrosive biomass fuel, moving circulating fluidized bed (CFB) superheaters from the convective pass into the hot recirculated fluidizing medium and adding an insulating layer to superheater tubes to raise their surface temperature above the dew point temperature of alkali chlorides. These design changes offer advantages but introduce other challenges. For example, operating with superheater temperatures above the dew point of alkali chlorides could require the use of creep-resistant tube alloys and doesn't eliminate chloride corrosion. Improved test methods that can be applied within this project include automated dimensional metrology to make a statistical analysis of depth of penetration and corrosion product thickness, and simultaneous thermal analysis measurements to quantify the melting of complex ashes and avoid the unreliability of the standard ash fusion test. Other important developments in testing include the installation of individually-temperature-controlled superheater loops for corrosion testing in operating boilers and temperature gradient testing...|$|E

Three ash samples were taken from the HRSG of a ferrosilicon furnace in Ningxia Province, China, which suffered from serious slagging and fouling. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to analyze the ash samples. The results show that low melting point salt Na 2 SO 4 and composite salts Na (AlSi 3 O 8) and 3 K 2 SO 4 ·CaSO 4 deposit on the <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> walls in aerosol form and solidify to form the initial slag layer. With the continuous deposition of the low melting point compounds, more and more ash particles in the flue gas adhere to the slag surface to form a thicker slag. Low melting point composite salt NaO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2 is absorbed on the evaporator tube walls in aerosol form. With the deposition of NaO·Al 2 O 3 ·SiO 2, more and more ash particles are absorbed to form the fouling. Since there is less space between pin-finned tubes, the large iron-rich slag particles are easily deposited on tube walls and fin surfaces, which is advantageous to the fouling process. There are large quantities of superfine ash particles in the flue gas that easily adhere to other particles or tube walls, which facilitates the slagging and fouling process...|$|E

Mineral matter present in coal is usually present as free ions, salts, organically bound inorganic and hard minerals. During {{coal combustion}} these minerals partly vaporized, coalesce or fragment. The mineral matter in coal transforms into ash during combustion and deposition on wall surfaces causing problems such as fouling and slagging. The deposited lumps called clinkers, mainly in radiation zone directly exposed to flame radiation resulting to slagging, while sintered deposit in convection zone not directly exposed by flame radiation called fouling. The scope of this work encompasses identification of slagging and clinker formation areas in a typical 330 MW boiler using commercial code FLUENT and several available empirical indices. The propensity of the slagging with the used coal is calculated by several thermal indices. Temperature distributions, velocity profiles and particle trajectories were analysed and utilised to predict the most probable zones likely to experience clinker formation. Most probable spots for slagging were found in the radiation zone near to the nose of furnace and left-top side of <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> sections which agrees closely with the plant observations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a physics-based model to describe accelerated corrosion because of alkali-halide-containing deposits, which form on <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> walls during biomass co-firing. Increased rates of corrosion during the co-firing of peat with biomass {{have been identified}} as a limiting factor on the level of biomass, which is viable to use at elevated temperatures. In the present work, a synthetic salt, representative of a 70 : 30 peat/biomass mix, has been applied to pure iron samples in air at 540 and 600 Â°C. The corrosion layers have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy (OM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental mapping to provide insight into the material degradation and structure of the corrosion layer. Two distinct types of oxides are found to form on the iron substrate. Initially, a compact, uniform oxide layer forms over the substrate. As the process continues, this oxide layer degrades, leading to spalling, which sees the broken oxide pieces mix with the salt layer. Additional test samples were examined without deposits as controls to highlight the accelerated rate of corrosion. Two modeling techniques are examined: the widely used labyrinth factor method (LFM) and the newly proposed porosity-based corrosion method (PCM). The PCM uses measurements of porosity and pore radius, coupled with a physically based corrosion mechanism, to predict corrosion rates.

The local heat transfer around the tube bundles was measured {{to predict the}} local temperature distribution and vulnerable positions of the superheated tube bundles. The maximally superheated tube bundles were simulated in the laboratory and local heat transfer was measured by using the naphthalene sublimation method. The experiment was conducted on three lines of tube bundles, all with in-line arrangements. Each line consist of six tubes. The distance in the streamwise direction (Sx/∅) was 1. 99 {{and that in the}} spanwise direction (Sz/∅) was 5. 45. The Reynolds number varied from 5000 to 30, 000, which covers a range of different operating conditions. Thermal and stress analyses were conducted numerically, based on the experimental data. The results showed that the flow characteristic changes the local heat transfer of the tube bundles. The flow impinged on the stagnation point of Tube 1 and reattached at 60 ° of Tube 2. The high heat transfer occurred at those positions of the tube bundles. The temperature and stress distributions on the surface of each tube bundle also varied. The reattachment point on Tube 2 had the highest heat transfer and temperature distribution. That position on Tube 2 was subjected to the highest stress due to the large temperature gradient.

Welding a nickel alloy similar to IN 625 onto the outer bore of a 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo steel tube enhances its service life as a <b>superheater</b> <b>tube</b> in the highly corrosive environment of a Waste-to-Energy boiler. For the purposes of studying the effects of high temperature service on the microstructure of this laid tube with a weld overly, a series of thermal exposure tests at 650 ˚C was performed for different times from 1 day up to 128 days. The microstructural evolution was studied {{using a combination of}} analytical techniques along with changes in hardness profile across the interface. Changes in the microstructure were examined using OM, SEM, EPMA, EBSD and FIB-STEM. Hardness survey results indicate significant changes in the interfacial region during ageing. Formation of a soft zone ~ 300 μm wide and its subsequent re-hardening was observed in the steel side while the hardness of the bulk steel remained unchanged. Development of a hard band ~ 30 μm wide adjacent to the interface in the weld overlay region and hardening of the bulk overlay material occurs {{in the early stages of}} ageing and remained unchanged with ageing time. Thermodynamic calculations were performed using Thermo-Calc software and TCFE 6 and TTNI 7 databases to aid interpretation of experimental data. Microstructural evolution in the steel region is related to the carbide transformation process and carbon migration. In the bulk of the steel tube, the bimodal microstructure is stable and in the tempered martensite/bainite areas, the initial M 3 C transform to M 23 C 6 through a series of metastable carbides while in the ferrite grains, M 2 C carbide precipitates and transforms directly to the equilibrium carbide. The main process for supply of carbon atoms is transformation of carbides and the rates of transformation are related to the as-welded microstructure. On the steel side of interfacial region where bainite was formed after welding, the stability of metastable carbides is related to the carbon content. Long term ageing causes Mo replenishment in the coexisting ferrite and fine grains have formed in this region following long term ageing. Experimental observations confirmed that a network of alloyed M 23 C 6 carbide precipitates was formed at the interface in the steel side which are believed to interrupt the carbon migration across the interface. Moreover, there is a carbide precipitation region within ~ 100 μm from the interface in the weld overlay. Beyond this region intermetallic phases like Mo-rich μ and Nb-rich δ were formed in the interdendritic regions and along the grain boundaries. Hard band formation is related to precipitation of the σ phase. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Early US waste-to-energy {{plants were}} {{constructed}} using conventional boilers designed for fossil fuels, gas, and oil. Combusting MSW exposed those boilers {{to high levels}} of sulfides and chlorides that caused accelerated corrosion problems. MSW fuel required higher amounts of excess air that resulted in high furnace gas velocities and metal erosion. Depending upon the individual design of each boiler, effects of higher upper furnace temperature, flame impingement, and flyash carry over were reported. This paper describes a test conducted to extend the useful metal life of <b>superheater</b> <b>tubes</b> by employing recently developed high velocity continuous combustion (HVCC) metal spray materials...|$|R

One {{of the biggest}} problems for their development is superheater corrosion due to fuel corrosivity, especially of the straw. This limits both the temperature of the vapour and also the effectiveness of the plant. In order {{to know more about the}} reactions which happen inside the boiler of biomass, thermodynamic calculations using software (HSC Chemistry) have been carried out. Field tests have been carried out in the Sangüesa Biomass Plant in Navarra (Spain) : determination of the types of oxides and the deposits formed on the <b>superheaters</b> <b>tubes</b> as well as a program to measure temperatures. Finally, the global results are discussed...|$|R
