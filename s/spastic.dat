5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with <b>spastic</b> quadriplegia and <b>spastic</b> hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis viruses {{can develop}} into a chronic viral {{infection}} that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical <b>spastic</b> paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses {{that have been used}} as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary <b>spastic</b> paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 it {{merged with}} the British Council for the Welfare of <b>Spastics</b> to become The <b>Spastics</b> Society. The <b>Spastics</b> Society {{provided}} sheltered workshops and day centres for people with cerebral palsy (commonly referred to as <b>spastics</b> at the time, despite spasticity being a symptom of only one variant of cerebral palsy), who were seen as being unemployable in mainstream society. The Society also provided residential units and schools, as well as opening a chain of charity shops.|$|R

25|$|<b>Spastic</b> diplegia (the lower {{extremities}} {{are affected}} {{with little to}} no upper-body spasticity). The {{most common form of}} the <b>spastic</b> forms. Most people with <b>spastic</b> diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of <b>spastic</b> diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with <b>spastic</b> diplegia is unaffected by the condition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spastic</b> {{hemiplegia}} (one side being affected). Generally, {{injury to}} muscle-nerves {{controlled by the}} brain's left side will cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have <b>spastic</b> hemiplegia are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.|$|E

25|$|<b>Spastic</b> {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with <b>spastic</b> quadriplegia are {{the least}} {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
25|$|Progressive <b>spastic</b> {{weakness}} in legs and incontinence {{may be caused}} by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, <b>spastic</b> CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of <b>spastic</b> CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep <b>spastic</b> CP well-managed. If the spasticity {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E

25|$|Mixed {{cerebral}} palsy has symptoms of athetoid, ataxic and <b>spastic</b> CP appearing simultaneously, each to varying degrees, and both {{with and without}} symptoms of each.

25|$|Gait {{analysis}} techniques {{allow for}} the assessment of gait disorders and the effects of corrective orthopedic surgery.

25|$|Ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy is clinically observed in approximately 5-10% {{of all cases}} of {{cerebral palsy}}, making it the least frequent form of cerebral palsy diagnosed. Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures, differentiating it from the other two forms of cerebral palsy, which are <b>spastic</b> cerebral palsy (damage to cortical motor areas and underlying white matter) and athetoid cerebral palsy (damage to basal ganglia).|$|E
25|$|Speech and {{language}} disorders {{are common in}} people with cerebral palsy. The incidence of dysarthria is estimated to range from 31% to 88%, and around a quarter of people with CP are non-verbal. Speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control, laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction, and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oral-facial muscles. There are three major types of dysarthria in cerebral palsy: <b>spastic,</b> dyskinetic (athetosis), and ataxic.|$|E
25|$|This GABAA {{receptor}} {{contains many}} binding sites that allow conformational changes {{and are the}} primary target for drug development. The most common of these binding sites, benzodiazepine, allows for both agonist and antagonist effects on the receptor. A common drug, diazepam, acts as an allosteric enhancer at this binding site. Another receptor for GABA, known as GABAB, can be enhanced by a molecule called baclofen. This molecule acts as an agonist, therefore activating the receptor, and is known to help control and decrease <b>spastic</b> movement.|$|E
