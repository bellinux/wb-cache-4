5|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> was {{disarmed}} and decommissioned on 8 February {{and became}} a training ship for stokers and engineers in Toulon. The ship was condemned on 20 June 1920, although she was converted into an accommodation hulk. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> listed for disposal on 29 June 1931, but was not purchased, for 600,230 francs, until 24 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne {{was less}} {{severely}} damaged and was repaired at Bizerte, {{returning to the}} Dardanelles in May. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> arrived that same month and both ships provided fire support for French troops ashore. Charlemagne was transferred to Salonica in October 1915 where she joined the French squadron assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations in Greece. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> departed for a refit in Lorient that same month and relieved Charlemagne at Salonica in May 1916 so the latter could be refitted in Bizerte. Gaulois remained at the Dardanelles until August, covering the evacuation of Allied troops from Gallipoli {{at the end of}} 1915, when she started a refit at Brest.|$|E

5|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis,</b> {{named after}} King Louis IX, a Catholic saint, was {{authorised}} on 30 September 1895 {{as one of}} the three Charlemagne-class battleships. The ship was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 25 March 1895 and launched on 2 September 1896. She was commissioned on 15 September 1900 after completing her sea trials at the cost of 26,981,000 francs. Even before <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> was formally commissioned, she participated in a naval review conducted by the President of France, Émile Loubet, at Cherbourg in July 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Squadron and arrived in Toulon on 24 September. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> became the squadron flagship on 1 October and retained that duty until 24 February 1904. She transported Louis André, the Minister of War and Jean de Lanessan, the Minister of Marine on their tours of Corsica and Tunisia later in October. The following year, <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> and the Mediterranean Squadron participated in an international naval review by President Loubet in Toulon with ships from Spain, Italy and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} older French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. On 23 September, <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> was ordered to Port Said to escort a British convoy {{carrying}} troops from India. She remained on escort duties until November when she was ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by the German battlecruiser Goeben. The ship remained on station there until January 1915 when she was given a brief refit at Bizerte. Upon its completion, <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> was ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean where she became the flagship of the newly formed Syrian Squadron (escadre de Syrie) on 9 February. These ships were intended to attack Turkish positions and lines of communication in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> participated in the bombardment of Gaza and El Arish in April before she was transferred back to the Dardanelles in May.|$|E

5|$|European powers {{ignored the}} area until accidentally {{settling}} there in 1685. Miscalculations by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.

5|$|Four {{of the men}} deserted {{when they}} reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for twomonths.

5|$|In late 1996, Keeran ranch workers {{exploring}} {{with metal}} detectors located eight cast-iron cannons buried near Garcitas Creek.

5|$|The {{physician}} André du Laurens (1558–1609) {{claimed that}} Clovis I (r. 481–511) {{was the first}} king who touched for scrofula, but the medievalist Marc Bloch (1886–1944) {{argued that it was}} probably Philip I. Modern scholars, most notably Frank Barlow (1911–2009), agree that the French practice most likely originated from <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> IX (r. 1226–1270). The earliest direct evidence of the royal touch in England are the financial records dating from the reign of Edward I (r. 1272–1307). The crusading Edward I did not arrive in England until 1274 but the custom of giving one penny to each patient had become well established by 1276, suggesting that the practice dated at least from the reign of his father, Henry III (r. 1216–1272). Henry III, known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions, loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother-in-law, <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> IX, all of which makes it likely that he introduced the practice in England.|$|E
5|$|The two {{surviving}} {{ships were}} placed in reserve during 1917. Charlemagne was decommissioned later in 1917 and sold for scrap in 1923. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> briefly became a training ship in 1919–20 and was then converted {{to serve as an}} accommodation hulk in 1920. She was not sold until 1933, although she was listed for disposal in 1931.|$|E

50|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis’s</b> Catholic Parish Church (Ludwigskirche) {{was built}} in 1828 and 1829 in the Classicist style.

5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> Academy, later renamed <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> was {{the last}} of the three Charlemagne-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the mid-1890s. She spent most of her career {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Squadron (escadre de la Méditerranée) and usually was chosen to serve as a flagship. The ship was involved in two accidental ramming incidents with two other French warships in her career, one of which sank a submarine.|$|E
