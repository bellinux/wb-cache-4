5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum <b>state</b> <b>is</b> observed, the other particle's quantum <b>state</b> <b>is</b> determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} qubit channels for which three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> always sufficient to achieve the Holevo capacity. For these channels {{it is known that}} there are cases where two orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, two non-orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, or three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> necessary. Here a systematic theory is given which provides criteria to distinguish cases where two <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, and determine whether these two <b>states</b> should <b>be</b> orthogonal or non-orthogonal. In addition, we prove a theorem on the form of the optimal ensemble when three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, and present efficient methods of calculating the Holevo capacity.

5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each <b>state</b> <b>is</b> represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each <b>state</b> <b>is</b> entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new <b>state</b> <b>is</b> admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation <b>state</b> <b>is</b> spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 <b>state</b> <b>is</b> not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
