40|$|The doping culture {{represents}} {{an issue for}} sport and for society. Normative debates on doping have been mainly concerned with questions of the justifiability of doping. The practice <b>of</b> assigning <b>responsibility</b> for doping behaviour has chiefly been individual-based, focusing mainly on the individual athlete’s doping behaviour. The overarching aim of this thesis is to investigate the relevance {{and the importance of}} the ideas <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in relation to ethical debates on doping. The more specific aim is to examine the possibility <b>of</b> broadening the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> beyond the individual athlete, and to sketch a theoretical framework within which this expansion could be accommodated.  In the first study, it is argued that bioethicists have a moral/professional responsibility to start out from a realistic and up-to-date view of genetics in ethical debates on gene doping, and that good bioethics requires good empirics. In study 2, the role played by affective processes in influencing athletes’ attitudes towards doping behaviour is investigated, both on an individual and on a collective level. It is concluded that an exclusive focus on individual-level rule violation and sanctions may entail overlooking the greater social picture and would prove to be ineffective in the long term. In study 3, the common doping-is-cheating arguments are examined and it is argued that they fail to capture vital features of people’s moral responses to doping behaviour. An alternative account of cheating in sport is presented in terms of failure to manifest good will and respect. It is concluded that putting cheating in the broader context of human interpersonal relationships makes evident the need to broaden the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>responsibility</b> and agency beyond the individual athlete. In study 4, the particular case <b>of</b> assigning <b>responsibility</b> for doping to sports physicians is used to examine the current individual-based approach to responsibility. This approach underestimates the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>responsibility</b> by leaving out a range of other actors from the discourse <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> The central conclusion of the thesis is that transforming the current doping culture requires broadening the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to include individuals and groups of individuals other than the athletes themselves. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the criticisms of Carroll’s CSR Pyramid model have {{generated}} many attempts to construct a model that can genuinely be appropriate for other countries than America, and for the conditions faced by smaller businesses. One such attempt of worth, was that by Visser, since his model’s use of the stakeholder approach may ultimately widen the initially-outlined <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> The difference between the two models is not only in the order of priority or emphasis between the categories of responsibilities, but also in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> However, this addition still does not address all the issues. As for the other models briefly mentioned, it is clear that they are limited in their additions/changes and do not present a comprehensive answer. In this study, therefore, the categories proposed by both Carroll and Visser in their models, as social responsibilities, are followed with some modifications, in an effort to devise a new pyramid that can be transferred to all environments. The four CSR responsibilities within this new pyramid are economic, glocal, legal and ethical, and philanthropic. The glocal drivers of CSR, which represent a new addition, include: environmental conditions, socio-cultural matters, users of technology, and political rights. These are the conditions which do vary {{from one place to another}} and change over time due to the active or passive behaviour among managers, leaders and power structure in society. Given the argument by Antal et al. (2009, p. 285) that “the relations between business and society are defined in different ways according to historical, [cultural, political] socio-economic and legal context and the powers of the relevant actors”, it seems necessary to acknowledge this in the new pyramid.|$|E
