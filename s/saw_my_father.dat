25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

[...] In a December 16, 2007, {{interview}} with Tim Russert, Romney repeated {{his claim that}} his [...] "dad marched with Martin Luther King." [...] An article published by The Phoenix on December 19, 2007, argues that while David S. Broder [...] "references a 1967 book he co-authored on the Republican Party, which included a chapter on George Romney [...] a one-line statement that the senior Romney 'has marched with Martin Luther King through the exclusive Grosse Pointe suburb of Detroit',” historical sources found by The Phoenix found no references to George Romney having marched with Martin Luther King {{and that it was}} unlikely that a Governor and former Presidential candidate would go unnoticed. The Phoenix also discovered that Dr. King did not visit Grosse Pointe until after Broder's book was published. [...] The Detroit Free Press reported on December 20, 2007, that the Romney campaign later asserted that when Romney made these two statements to a national audience about his father marching with King that he was [...] "speaking figuratively, not literally." [...] Subsequently, The Politico reported that at least two witnesses did remember George Romney and King marching together. and the Romney campaign put out a string of citations affirming them appearing together and George Romney's commitment to civil rights in general. [...] In November 2007, the New York Times reported that Romney had participated with his father in civil rights marches.|$|E

60|$|My heavy head {{dropped into}} my hands, and I groaned. Many a temperance tale perused on Sunday afternoons {{came back to}} me.

In the misty air about me I <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> white face, <b>my</b> mother's sad eyes. I thought of Barbara, of the scorn that could quiver round that bewitching mouth; of Hal, with his tremendous contempt for all forms of weakness. Shame of the present and terror of the future between them racked my mind.|$|R
60|$|We {{got under}} way in fine style, and as the pungy swung around with the current, I <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> waving his hat from the craft to which he belonged, and thus knew he {{understood}} we were bound on some service for the commander.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the nascent Review {{had formed a}} junction with another project, of a purely literary periodical, to be edited by Mr. Henry Southern, afterwards a diplomatist, then a literary man by profession. The two editors agreed to unite their corps, and divide the editorship, Bowring taking the political, Southern the literary department. Southern's Review {{was to have been}} published by Longman, and that firm, though part proprietors of the Edinburgh, were willing to be the publishers of the new journal. But when all the arrangements had been made, and the prospectuses sent out, the Longmans <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> attack on the Edinburgh, and drew back. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was now appealed to for his interest with his own publisher, Baldwin, which was exerted with a successful result. And so in April, 1824, amidst anything but hope on <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> part, and that of most of those who afterwards aided in carrying on the Review, the first number made its appearance.|$|R

As we neared the castle I <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and three other of the workmen, together with the baron, {{coming down from the}} castle toward the spot. As my mother did not wish to approach while the baron was at hand, we stood within the trees {{at the edge of the}} wood and watched what was being done. The baron came with them down to the bushes, and then they again came out, crossed the river, and one of them cut some willows, peeled them, and erected the white staves in a line toward the castle. They walked for a bit on each side, and seemed to be making calculations. Then they went back into the castle, and I never <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] he said, also rising, [...] "if I have {{seemed a little}} dazed. I am very {{grateful}} to you for coming.

6000|$|Why I {{bought them}} I {{did not know}} at the time, and I do not know now.

60|$|I {{caught the}} general there, and, {{while my mother}} turned her head aside and smiled, I <b>saw</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> colored a little, though he made out to laugh.

6000|$|After we had been, with a {{good deal}} of form, {{presented}} to each other, at which time I easily <b>saw</b> by <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> manner that he was desirous of supporting Peter's character in my eyes, as much as circumstances would permit, 'Alan,' he said, 'this is the gentleman who has agreed to accept of you as his counsel, in place of young Dumtoustie.' ...|$|R
