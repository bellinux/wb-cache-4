5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given <b>shape,</b> <b>and</b> assert that it uniquely determines the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> is robust against small {{variations in the}} shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dirty paper coding (DPC) {{refers to}} methods for pre-subtraction of known {{interference}} at the transmitter of a multiuser communication system. There are numerous applica-tions for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels. Recently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for DPC. In lattice-based DPC, {{there are two}} codes- a convolutional code that defines a lattice used for <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> an error correction code used for channel coding. Several specific designs {{have been reported in}} the recent literature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder works on a joint trellis of <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> channel codes or the decoder requires iterations between the <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> channel decoders. This results in high complexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC scheme that provides good <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> coding gains with moderate complexity at both the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit <b>shaping,</b> <b>and</b> a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The crucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of the bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at the receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the <b>shaping</b> <b>and</b> channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the proposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an application of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition coding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast channel. I...|$|R
