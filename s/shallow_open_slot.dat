40|$|Manure {{application}} to grassland and arable land {{is an important}} source of ammonia and nitrous oxide losses. For both gasses, national and international policies have been developed with the objective of reducing the emissions. Since the early 1990 s, measurements have been carried out in The Netherlands to assess the gaseous losses from manure application, especially for ammonia. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions are relatively scarce. This paper presents the results of these measurements with the objective of providing an updated quantification of the effect of techniques for application and incorporation of manure, and to assess influencing factors. The manure application techniques differ in their spreading or placement of the manure onto the grass or soil surface or into the soil. The following techniques are treated in this paper: surface spreading, narrow-band application, <b>shallow</b> injection with <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> on grassland, and surface spreading, surface incorporation, deep placement on arable land. Low emission techniques such as narrow band application, shallow injection, incorporation or injection on arable land show a significant reduction of ammonia emission compared to surface spreading. On grassland, average emission factors (% of total ammonium nitrogen) were 74 % for surface spreading and 16 % for shallow injection. On arable land, the emission factors were 69 % for surface spreading and 2 % for deep placement. However, the nitrous oxide emission factor from manure applied with low ammonia emissions techniques is higher than the emission factor for surface applied manures. In a whole farm context, the higher nitrous oxide emission with shallow injection is partly offset directly by reduced emissions from fertiliser savings and indirectly from lower ammonia losses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel skewed-type iron slot wedge that can improve both the cogging torque and the output {{power of a}} {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). Generally the <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> structure is adopted in a PMSG due to its convenient winding work, but the high cogging torque is undesired. Firstly, an iron slot wedge was utilized to reduce the cogging torque of an <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> type PMSG. However, the output power of the machine decreased rapidly with this method. Thus, a proposed skewed type iron slot wedge is presented to improve the output power {{as well as the}} cogging torque as compared to the <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> type. Shape optimization of the skewed-type iron slot wedge is performed to simultaneously maximize the output power and reduce the cogging torque. The Kriging model based on the Halton sequence method and a genetic algorithm are used to optimize the design...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} mechanics {{of particles with}} shapes on a one-dimensional lattice is investigated {{in the context of}} the s = 1 Ising chain with uniform nearest-neighbor coupling, quadratic single-site potential, and a magnetic field, which supports four distinct ground states: | ↑↓↑↓···), |◦◦···), | ↑↑ ···), | ↑ ◦ ↑ ◦···). The complete spectrum is generated from each ground state by particles from a different set of six or seven species. Particles and elements of the pseudovacuum are characterized by motifs (patterns of several consecutive site variables). Particles are floating objects that can be placed into <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> on the lattice. <b>Open</b> <b>slots</b> are recognized as permissible links between motifs. The energy of a particle varies between species but is independent of where it is placed. Placement of one particle changes the open-slot configuration for particles of all species. This statistical interaction is encoded in a generalized Pauli principle, from which the multiplicity of states for a given particle= combination is determined and used for the exact statistical mechanical analysis. Particles from all species belong to one of four categories: compacts, hosts, tags, or hybrids. Compacts and hosts find <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> in segments of pseudovacuum. Tags find <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> inside hosts. Hybrids are tags with hosting capability. In the taxonomy of particles proposed here, “species” is indicative of structure and “category” indicative of function. The hosting function splits the Pauli principle into exclusion and accommodation parts. Near phase boundaries, the state of the Ising chain at low temperature is akin to that of miscible or immiscible liquids with particles from one species acting as surfactant molecules...|$|R

The hydrothermal fluid may have been released to the surface gradually from the newly formed fumarole area in Owakudani just above the open crack.|$|R

50|$|The {{hopscotch}} {{hashing algorithm}} works by defining {{a neighborhood of}} buckets near the original hashed bucket, where a given entry is always found. Thus, search {{is limited to the}} number of entries in this neighborhood, which is logarithmic in the worst case, constant on average, and with proper alignment of the neighborhood typically requires one cache miss. When inserting an entry, one first attempts to add it to a bucket in the neighborhood. However, if all buckets in this neighborhood are occupied, the algorithm traverses buckets in sequence until an <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> (an unoccupied bucket) is found (as in linear probing). At that point, since the empty bucket is outside the neighborhood, items are repeatedly displaced in a sequence of hops. (This is similar to cuckoo hashing, but with the difference that in this case the empty slot is being moved into the neighborhood, instead of items being moved out with the hope of eventually finding an empty slot.) Each hop brings the <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> closer to the original neighborhood, without invalidating the neighborhood property of any of the buckets along the way. In the end, the <b>open</b> <b>slot</b> has been moved into the neighborhood, and the entry being inserted can be added to it.|$|R
