50|$|The {{standard}} {{does not}} cover electrical hazards from work on, near, or with conductors or equipment in electric utilization (premise wiring) installations, which are outlined by 29 CFR Part 1910 <b>Subpart</b> <b>S.</b> The specific lockout and tagout provisions for electrical shock and burn hazards {{can be found in}} 29 CFR Part 1910.333. Controlling hazardous energy in installations for the exclusive purpose of power generation, transmission, and distribution, including related equipment for communication or metering, is covered by 29 CFR 1910.269.|$|E
50|$|OSHA Standards 29 CFR, Parts 1910 and 1926. Occupational Safety and Health Standards. Part 1910, <b>subpart</b> <b>S</b> (electrical) §§ 1910.332 through 1910.335 contain {{generally}} applicable requirements for safety-related work practices. On April 11, 2014, OSHA adopted revised standards for electric power generation, transmission, and distribution work at part 1910, § 1910.269 and part 1926, subpart V, which contain requirements for {{arc flash protection}} and guidelines for assessing arc-flash hazards, making reasonable estimates of incident heat energy from electric arcs, and selecting appropriate protective equipment (79 FR 20316 et seq., Apr. 11, 2014). All of these OSHA standards reference NFPA 70E.|$|E
40|$|In February 1993, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the {{corrective}} action management unit (CAMU) and temporary unit (TU) regulations as 40 CFR Part 264, <b>Subpart</b> <b>S.</b> These regulations {{are intended to}} foster the selection of protective and cost-effective remedies {{for the restoration of}} sites contaminated by hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, and hazardous waste constituents by removing certain regulatory impediments to implementing those remedies, most notably those of the land disposal restrictions (LDRs). This paper provides a brief overview of the CAMU and TU regulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{procedure}} provides {{guidelines and}} techniques for analyzing and trending data using statistical methods for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). This procedure outlines the steps used in data analysis and trending. It includes guidelines for performing data analysis and for monitoring (or controlling) processes using performance indicators. This procedure is used when trending and analyzing item characteristics and reliability, process implementation, and other quality-related information to identify items, services, activities, and processes needing improvement, {{in accordance with}} 10 CFR Part 830, <b>Subpart</b> A, U. <b>S.</b> Department of Energy (DOE) Order 414. 1 C, and University of California (UC) Assurance Plan for LBNL. Trend codes, outlined in Attachment 4, are assigned to issues {{at the time of}} initiation and entry into the Corrective Action Tracking System (CATS) database in accordance with LBNL/PUB- 5519 (1), Issues Management Program Manual. Throughout this procedure, the term performance is used to encompass all aspects of performance including quality, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability. Data analysis tools are appropriate whenever quantitative information describing the performance of an item, service, or process can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|On July 27, 1990, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{proposed}} a regulatory framework (55 FR 30798) {{for responding to}} releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents from solid waste management units (SWMUs) at facilities seeking permits or permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The proposed rule, `Corrective Action for Solid Waste Management Units at Hazardous Waste Facilities`, would create a new <b>Subpart</b> <b>S</b> under the 40 CFR 264 regulations, and outlines requirements for conducting RCRA Facility Investigations, evaluating potential remedies, and selecting and implementing remedies (i. e., corrective measures) at RCRA facilities. EPA anticipates instances where releases or suspected releases of hazardous wastes or constituents from SWMUs identified in a RCRA Facility Assessment, and subsequently addressed as part of required RCRA Facility Investigations, will be found to be non-existent or non-threatening to human health or the environment. Such releases may require no further action. For such situations, EPA {{proposed a}} mechanism for making a determination that no further corrective action is needed. This mechanism {{is known as a}} Determination of No Further Action (DNFA) (55 FR 30875). This information Brief describes what a DNFA is and discusses the mechanism for making a DNFA. This is {{one of a series of}} Information Briefs on RCRA corrective action...|$|E
40|$|Pulping is {{the term}} used for the process which {{separates}} wood fibers. Chemical pulping, dissolving the lignin in the wood to create a pulp, is {{the most commonly used}} pulping process. Chemical pulping creates higher sheet strength than mechanical pulping; however, yields 40 to 50 percent pulp, where mechanical pulping yields 95 percent pulp. The two main types of chemical pulping are the more common sulfate pulping (most commonly known as Kraft pulping) and sulfite pulping. Kraft pulping accommodates a variety of tree species, recovers and reuses all pulping chemicals, and creates a paper with a higher sheet strength. Sulfite pulp, however, is easier to bleach, yields more bleached pulp, and is easier to refine for papermaking. The major difference between the two types of chemical pulping is the types of chemicals used to dissolve the lignin. This report will focus mainly on these two types of chemical pulping and bleach plants. Pulp mills are one of the largest emission sources in Washington and a large toxic pollutant emission producer. There are eight pulp mills in Washington: six Kraft (sulfate) mills and two sulfite mills (one sulfite mill has recently closed). EPA formally adopted MACT in April 1998 for certain pulping processes. Sources will have between 3 and 8 years to come into compliance with the provisions of the MACT. Emissions estimations made after MACT has become effective should be sure to take emissions limitations due to MACT into account. The MACT provisions are found in Part 63, <b>Subpart</b> <b>S,</b> sections 63. 440 - 63. 459 of the Code of Federal Regulations. MACT requirements for combustion sources at pulp and paper mills will be subject to a separate MACT. Kraft (Sulfate) Pulping The Kraft process was developed in Germany in 1879 and was first applied to a Swedish mill i...|$|E
40|$|Corrective Action Management Units (CAMUs) were {{established}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to streamline the remediation of hazardous waste sites. Streamlining involved providing cost saving measures for the treatment, storage, and safe containment of the wastes. To expedite cleanup and remove disincentives, EPA designed 40 CFR 264 <b>Subpart</b> <b>S</b> to be flexible. At {{the heart of this}} flexibility are the provisions for CAMUs and Temporary Units (TUs). CAMUs and TUs were created to remove cleanup disincentives resulting from other Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste provisions [...] specifically, RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDRs) and minimum technology requirements (MTRs). Although LDR and MTR provisions were not intended for remediation activities, LDRs and MTRs apply to corrective actions because hazardous wastes are generated. However, management of RCRA hazardous remediation wastes in a CAMU or TU is not subject to these stringent requirements. The CAMU at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico (SNL/NM) was proposed through an interactive process involving the regulators (EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department), DOE, SNL/NM, and stakeholders. The CAMU at SNL/NM has been accepting waste from the nearby Chemical Waste Landfill remediation since January of 1999. During this time, a number of unique techniques have been implemented to save costs, improve health and safety, and provide the best value and management practices. This presentation will take the audience through the corrective action process implemented at the CAMU facility, from the selection of the CAMU site to permitting and construction, waste management, waste treatment, and final waste placement. The presentation will highlight the key advantages that CAMUs and TUs offer in the corrective action process. These advantages include yielding a practical approach to regulatory compliance, expediting efficient remediation and site closure, and realizing potentially significant cost savings compared to off-site disposal. Specific examples of CA MU advantages realized by SNL/NM will be presented along with the above highlighted process improvements, Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) performance, and associated lessons learned...|$|E
