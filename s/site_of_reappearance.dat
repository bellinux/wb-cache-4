40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} host {{factors affecting}} the delay <b>of</b> <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> malaria parasites after radical treatment, a study was underdaken in Dielmo, Senegal, {{an area of}} intense perennial malaria transmission. A 7 -day course of quinine was administered to 173 asymptomatic persons from 1 to 85 years <b>of</b> age and <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> malaria parasites in the peripheral blood was monitored weekly for 14 weeks. Additional thick blood films were made in case of fever {{as part of a}} daily clinical surveillance. The median times before <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> Plasmodium falciparum were 22, 39, and 53 days among persons 1 – 6, 7 – 14, and 15 years of age, respectively (P 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the daily rate <b>of</b> <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> P. falciparum was 2. 2 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 – 4. 5) times lower in sickle cell trait carriers than in AA individuals, and 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 1) times lower in bed nets users than in non-users. The risk ratio for the daily risk <b>of</b> <b>reappearance</b> was significantly related to the level of parasitemia before treatment. No influence of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, HLA-B 53, and DR 13 were ob-served. Findings show that monitoring during a few weeks the <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> malaria parasites after treatment among a small cohort of individuals naturally exposed to malaria is relevant for investigating host resistance factors. This suggest that small, low-cost, field trials may be very informative on the potential of new malaria vaccine candidates. Recent studies in highly malarious areas have shown a...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chilling}} temperatures (5 °C) on chlorophyll fluorescence transients {{was used to}} study chilling-induced inhibition of photosynthesis in plant species with differing chilling sensitivities. A Brancker SF- 20 fluorometer {{was used to measure}} induced fluorescence transients from both attached and detached leaves of chilling-sensitive cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv Ashley) and chilling-resistant pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska). The rate <b>of</b> <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> the variable component of fluorescence (Fv), following a period of illumination at 25 °C, was dependent on the temperature at which the leaf was allowed to dark adapt in chilling-sensitive cucumber, but not in chilling-resistant pea. In cucumber, dark adaptation at 25 °C following illumination resulted in a much faster return of Fv than dark adaptation at 5 °C following illumination. However, Fv reappearance during the dark adaptation period in chilling-resistant pea was temperature independent. The difference in the temperature response of Fv following illumination correlated with temperature sensitivity of these two species. The process responsible for the difference in Fv may represent a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> chilling sensitivity in the photosynthetic apparatus...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a naturalistic behavioral task {{to investigate the}} influence of spatial and temporal expectations on attentional orienting to moving targets. In this task, the movement of an object before its disappearance under an occluding barrier generated expectations concerning the location and/or time <b>of</b> its <b>reappearance.</b> Four different trial types were intermixed, each inducing a different state of expectation: no expectation, only spatial expectation about the location <b>of</b> <b>reappearance,</b> only temporal expectation about the moment <b>of</b> <b>reappearance,</b> and combined spatial and temporal expectation. The behavioral validity of the task was shown {{by the fact that}} all expectation conditions produced significantly shorter reaction times than the control state of no expectation. Spatial attention modulated early perceptual analysis in extrastriate areas, as demonstrated by significant enhancement of the visual P 1 component. Temporal attention alone had no effect on P 1 but instead modulated response-specific components. However, when spatial and temporal attention were combined, the enhancement of perceptual processing was significantly augmented, leading to a greater enhancement of the P 1 component than by spatial attention alone. Perceptual analysis reflected by the P 1 component correlated significantly with reaction times. In summary, event-related potentials revealed the presence of individual modulatory effects attributable to spatial and temporal expectation as well as synergistic effects indicative of an interaction of the two. This synergistic effect is likely to {{play a critical role in}} directing attention to the <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> a temporarily occluded moving target, a process of obvious importance in everyday situations.

We manipulated a baseline auditory rhythm - consisting of equal sound and pause durations - in two ways: either the pause durations or the sound durations were increased to create slower rhythms. Participants had to press a button at the moment they expected the disk to reappear. Variations in pause duration (Experiments 1 and 2) affected expected TTC, in contrast to variations in sound duration (Experiment 3). These results show that auditory rhythms affect expected <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> an occluded moving object.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} rate and magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> photosystem II (PSII) variable fluorescence following illumination {{has been used to}} determine plant temperature optima. The present study was designed to determine the effect of a plant's environmental history on the thermal dependency <b>of</b> the <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> PSII variable fluorescence. In addition, this study further evaluated the usefulness of this fluorescence technique in identifying plant temperature optima. Laboratory and greenhouse grown potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv “Norgold M”) plants had a thermal kinetic window between 15 and 25 °C. The minimum apparent Km of NADH hydroxypyruvate reductase for NADH occurred at 20 °C. This temperature was also the temperature providing maximal <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> variable fluorescence. Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill cv “Wayne”) plants had a thermal kinetic window between 15 and 30 °C with a minimum apparent Km at 25 °C. Maximal <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> variable fluorescence was seen between 20 and 30 °C. To determine if increasing environmental temperatures increased the temperature optimum provided from the fluorescence response curves, potato and soybean leaves from irrigated and dryland field grown plants were evaluated. Although the absolute levels of PSII variable fluorescence declined with increasing thermal stress, the temperature optimum of the dryland plants did not increase with increased exposure to elevated temperatures. Because of variability in the daily period of high temperature stress in the field, studies were initiated with tobacco plants grown in controlled environment chambers. The <b>reappearance</b> <b>of</b> PSII variable fluorescence in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv “Wisconsin 38 ”) leaves that had experienced continuous leaf temperatures of 35 °C for 8 days had the same 20 °C optima as leaves from plants grown at room temperature.
