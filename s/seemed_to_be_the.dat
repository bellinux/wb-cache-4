5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time {{on the island of}} Capreae.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; {{the cream}} of the Allied forces, which {{included}} the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either reinforcing the Belgians in the east of the country, at the Meuse–Albert Canal line, and holding the Scheldt Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting Ghent and Antwerp, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> soundest defensive strategy.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Democratic nominating convention, Brown <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{favorite}} for the nomination. On the first ballot, he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over {{the next nine}} ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> answer the Devils were looking for in goal, however the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would {{have the responsibility to}} draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E
5|$|One {{striking}} {{difference was}} that late army doctrine (and practice) aimed at avoiding open battle with the enemy if possible, unlike the early doctrine from the Principate of seeking to bring the enemy to battle as often and as quickly as possible. The main motivation was likely not a reduced ability to win such encounters. The late army continued to win {{the great majority of}} its battles with barbarians. Rather, the primary concern <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> need to minimise casualties. Pitched battles generally resulted in heavy losses of high-grade comitatenses troops, which could not be easily replaced. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the late army had greater difficulty than the Principate in finding sufficient recruits, and especially high-quality recruits. The late army preferred to attack the enemy by stealth or stratagem: ambushes, surprise attacks, harassment and manoeuvres to corner the enemy in zones where they could not access supplies and from which they could not escape (e.g. by blocking mountain passes or river crossings).|$|E

Comparing the results of all SSRIs with different treatment methods, paroxetine and fluvoxamine <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> easiest compounds <b>to</b> eliminate independent of method, while fluoxetine and sertraline <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most stable.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

25|$|By 1768, {{the rapid}} growth of Glasgow had vastly {{increased}} the demand for coal, and its price: several bodies expressed concern, and the magistrates of Glasgow took action. The Lord Provost was James Buchanan of Drumpellier, and the rich Monklands coalfield was practically untapped. Canals were being promoted all over the country, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> obvious solution here; the magistrates commissioned James Watt to recommend a route.|$|E
25|$|The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala {{took nearly}} {{three years in a}} {{painstaking}} search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers.

Gene Autry, though holding a controlling interest in the Angels, was in control in name only due to poor health in his advanced years. Autry's wife Jackie, 20 years his junior, at times <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> decision-maker, and at other times the Disney Company, then a minority owner, seemed to be in charge.|$|E
25|$|Plex {{began as}} a {{freeware}} hobby project in December 2007 when the developer Elan Feingold {{was looking for a}} media centre application for his Apple Mac, better than Front Row. Feingold came out of the desire to get XBMC (now known as Kodi) code running on a more powerful machine that could handle higher resolution media than the devices on which XBMC was usually running. According to Feingold, the perfect platform <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Mac, especially with the form factor of the Mac Mini.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the larval stage, the pupal stage seems {{much less}} variable.

Sex {{did not affect}} the length of the stage. When compared to other wasps, the M. drewseni pupal stage is very stable and less prone to variation. Graphic representations of the duration of pupal stage vs. date shows that the duration seems to ebb and flow, being very long in the end of October and dipping significantly in the month of December.|$|E
