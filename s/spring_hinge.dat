A boom attached by tape spring to a rigid stand was released and the boom bounced up to 60 ° before coming to rest (as opposed to snap-through behavior). These large amplitude bounces can cause the boom to collide with sensors, other booms or arrays causing damage or preventing full deployment. Results show the first bounce of deployment is nearly bounded by a four parameter ellipse. The ellipses of similar folds are similar also, suggesting that a model can be developed.

A spacecraft bus with dimensions of 0. 6 × 0. 6 × 0. 8 m 3 is assumed and the deployable structures are required to fit alongside the bus, in an envelope not exceeding 0. 6 × 0. 2 × 0. 8 m 3. Three types of requirements are considered, as follows: booms for space based GPS ap-plications; 1. 5 – 2 kW solar arrays; X-band (9. 65 GHz) SAR’s requiring either a 3 m diameter parabolic reflector or a 5 × 1. 5 m 2 planar array. This report presents three novel deployable structures that have been developed to meet these requirements.

40|$|The {{ability to}} fold and unfold large sensor {{structures}} in space using hinges {{is important for}} space-based sensor technology. Tape <b>spring</b> <b>hinges</b> have become common in deployable space structures due to simplicity, repeatability and unique folding properties. The mechanical response of these hinges (moment-curvature, energy stored etc.) is important in ensuring safety, deployment accuracy as well as optimizing cost of the structure. In an effort {{to learn more about}} the folding and deployment properties, finite element software, Abaqus™, was used to analyze a hinge using multidirectional bending. The analysis involved large deformation (rotation through 180 degrees), nonlinear geometric loading. In order to increase confidence in the analysis procedures, a study was conducted on how the type and size of elements affects stability and buckling of a simply-supported plate. In order to fold a tape spring, a specified length of the middle segment of the hinge was first flattened, so the initial curvature about the long axis of the hinge was removed. This minimizes the moment of inertia and hence stiffness allowing it to be folded. With the middle segment flattened, the hinge was subjected to opposite-sense bending about the hinge’s short axis (axis perpendicular to the length of the tape spring). In addition to providing the needed mechanical response, the study allowed investigation into the optimum method of folding a hinge. Energy stored during folding and unfolding could be evaluated which allows the designer to determine adequate passive damping to obtain necessary post-deployment stability and pointing accuracy.
