25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a <b>short</b> <b>final</b> pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E

500|$|A 200-page autobiographical {{account of}} her travels was {{published}} in July 1857 by James Blackwood as Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, the first autobiography written by a black woman in Britain. Priced at one shilling and six pence (1/6) a copy, the cover bears a striking portrait of Seacole in red, yellow and black ink. Robinson speculates that she dictated the work to an editor, identified in the book only as W.J.S., who improved her grammar and orthography. In the work Seacole deals with the first 39years {{of her life in}} one short chapter. She then expends six chapters on her few years in Panama, before using the following 12chapters to detail her exploits in Crimea. She avoids mention of the names of her parents and precise date of birth. A <b>short</b> <b>final</b> [...] "Conclusion" [...] deals with her return to England, and lists supporters of her fund-raising effort, including Rokeby, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Newcastle, William Russell, and other prominent men in the military. The book was dedicated to Major-General Lord Rokeby, commander of the First Division; and William Howard Russell wrote as a preface, [...] "I have witnessed her devotion and her courage... and I trust that England will never forget one who has nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and succour them and who performed the last offices for some of her illustrious dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{entering}} {{service with}} the US Army, the aircraft received {{the reputation of}} a [...] "" [...] due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. The Marauder had to be flown at exact airspeeds, particularly on final runway approach and when one engine was out.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out whether ironic effects in a far aiming task were {{accompanied}} by <b>shorter</b> <b>final</b> fixations on the target. Generally, it is well known that a sufficiently long final fixation on the target is of crucial importance for accurate performance in far aiming. Recently, it has been shown that ironic effects in golf putts and penalty kicks (in which one does the opposite of what was intended, e. g., shoot close to the keeper while attempting to avoid this) were preceded by longer fixations on the to-be-avoided area, which may have resulted in <b>shorter</b> <b>final</b> fixations on the target area. Therefore, in the current study we examined football players taking penalties in a simulated penalty environment with and without instructions to avoid the goalkeeper. The findings revealed that ironic effects were indeed accompanied by significantly <b>shorter</b> <b>final</b> fixations on the target area, i. e., the open goal space. It is concluded that in far aiming tasks, ironic effects are accompanied by insufficiently long final fixations on the target. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

The aircraft were on <b>short</b> <b>final</b> approach to runway 23 at an altitude of about [...] above ground level. The nose of the F-16D severed the C-130E's right elevator. On impact, the F-16 pilot applied full afterburner to try to recover the aircraft, but it began to disintegrate, showering debris on the runway and a road that ran around it. Both F-16 crewmembers ejected, but their aircraft, still on full afterburner, continued on an arc towards Green Ramp. At the same time, the C-130 crew took their aircraft away from the airfield and checked to ensure it could safely land. While the C-130 crew knew they were most likely struck by the F-16, they had no idea how it happened or the extent of the damage. After performing their checks, the crew returned to Pope and landed on the debris-littered runway.|$|E

6000|$|... [FN#1] Men of the Maghrab, or Western Africa; the vulgar plural is Maghrabin, {{generally}} written [...] "Mogrebyn." [...] May not {{the singular}} {{form of this}} word {{have given rise to}} the Latin [...] "Maurus," [...] by elision of the Ghayn, to Italians an unpronounceable consonant? From Maurus comes the Portuguese [...] "Moro," [...] and our [...] "Moor." [...] When Vasco de Gama reached Calicut, he found there a tribe of Arab colonists, who in religion and in language were the same as the people of Northern Africa,-for this reason he called them [...] "Moors." [...] This was explained long ago by Vincent (Periplus, lib. 3), and lately by Prichard (Natural History of Man). I repeat it because it has been my fate to hear, at a meeting of a learned society in London, a gentleman declare, that in Eastern Africa he found a people calling themselves Moors. Maghrabin-Westerns,-then would be opposed to Sharkiyin, Easterns, the origin of our [...] "Saracen." [...] From Gibbon downwards many have discussed the history of this word; but few expected in the nineteenth century to see a writer on Eastern subjects assert, with Sir John Mandeville, that these people [...] "properly, ben clept Sarrazins of Sarra." [...] The learned M. Jomard, who never takes such original views of things, asks a curious question:-"Mais comment un son aussi distinct que le Chine [Arabic text] aurait-il pu se confondre avec le Syn [Arabic text] et, pour un mot aussi connu que charq; comment aurait-on pu se tromper a l'omission des points?" [...] Simply because the word Saracens came to us through the Greeks (Ptolemy uses it), who have no such sound as sh in their language, and through the Italian which, hostile to the harsh sibilants of Oriental dialects, generally melts sh down into s. So the historical word Hashshashiyun-hemp-drinker,-civilised by the Italians into [...] "assassino," [...] became, as all know, an expression of European use. But if any one adverse to [...] "etymological fancies" [...] objects to my deriving Maurus from [...] "Maghrab," [...] let him remember Johnson's successfully tracing the course of the metamorphosis of [...] "dies" [...] into [...] "jour." [...] An even more peculiar change we may discover in the word [...] "elephant." [...] "Pilu" [...] in Sanscrit, became [...] "pil" [...] in old Persian, which ignores <b>short</b> <b>final</b> vowels; [...] "fil," [...] and, with the article, [...] "Al-fil," [...] in Arabic, which supplies the place of p (an unknown letter to it), by f; and elephas in Greek, which is fond of adding [...] "as" [...] to Arabic words, as in the cases of Aretas (Haris) and Obodas (Obayd). [...] "A name," [...] says Humboldt, [...] "often becoming a historical monument, and the etymological analysis of language, however it may be divided, is attended by valuable results." [...] [FN#2] The Toni or Indian canoe is the hollowed-out trunk of a tree,-near Bombay generally a mango.

[FN#3] In these vessels each traveller, unless a previous bargain be made, is expected to provide his own water and firewood.

[FN#6] The hands are raised in order to catch the blessing that is supposed to descend from heaven upon the devotee; and the meaning of drawing the palms down the face is symbolically to transfer the benediction to every part of the body. [FN#7] As is the case under all despotic governments, nothing can be more intentionally offensive than the official manners of a superior to his inferior in Egypt. The Indians charge their European fellow-subjects with insolence of demeanour and coarseness of language. As far as my experience goes, our roughness and brusquerie are mere politeness compared with what passes between Easterns. At the same time it must be owned that I have seen the worst of it. [FN#8] It was far safer and more expeditious in Al-Adrisi's day (A.D. 1154), when the captain used to sit on the poop [...] "furnished with numerous and useful instruments"; when he [...] "sounded the shallows, and by his knowledge of the depths could direct the helmsman where to steer."

The Christians have two equally favourite lines: the Moslems patronise one so impossible, that it has had attractions enough to fix their choice. It extends from Zafaran Point to Hammam Bluffs, ten miles of deep water. [FN#11] The Hebrew name of this part of the Red Sea. In a communication lately made to the Royal Geographical Society, I gave my reasons for believing that the Greeks borrowed their Erythraean Sea from the Arabic [...] "Sea of Himyar." [...] [FN#12] Most travellers remark that they have never seen a brighter blue than that of the Red Sea. It was the observation of an early age that [...] "the Rede Sea is not more rede than any other sea, but in some place thereof is the gravelle rede, and therefore men clepen it the Rede Sea." [...] [FN#13] Jild al-Faras (or Kamar al-Din), a composition of apricot paste, dried, spread out, and folded into sheets, exactly resembling the article after which it is named.

[FN#14] [...] "Pharaoh's hot baths," [...] which in our maps are called [...] "Hummum Bluffs."

[FN#15] One of the numerous species of what the Italians generally call [...] "Pasta." [...] The material is wheaten or barley flour rolled into small round grains. In Barbary it is cooked by steaming, and served up with hard boiled eggs and mutton, sprinkled with red pepper. These Badawi Maghrabis merely boiled it. [FN#16] The Azan is differently pronounced, though similarly worded by every orthodox nation in Al-Islam. [FN#17] The usual way of kissing the knee is to place the finger tips upon it, and then to raise them to the mouth. It is an action denoting great humility, and the condescending superior who is not an immediate master returns the compliment in the same way. [FN#18] The Maghrabi dialect is known to be the harshest and most guttural form of Arabic. It owes this unenviable superiority to its frequency of [...] "Sukun," [...] or the quiescence of one or more consonants;-"K'lab," [...] for instance, for [...] "Kilab," [...] and [...] "'Msik" [...] for [...] "Amsik." [...] Thus it is that vowels, the soft and liquid part of language, disappear, leaving in their place a barbarous sounding mass of consonants. [FN#19] Burckhardt mentions the Arab legend that the spirits of the drowned Egyptians may be seen moving at the bottom of the sea, and Finati adds that they are ever busy recruiting their numbers with shipwrecked mariners. [FN#20] I thus called upon a celebrated Sufi or mystic, whom many East-Indian Moslems reverence as the Arabs do their Prophet. In Appendix I the curious reader will find Abd al-Kadir again mentioned. [FN#21] Those people are descendants of Syrians and Greeks that fled from Candia, Scios, the Ionian Islands, and Palestine to escape the persecutions of the Turks. They now wear the Arab dress, and speak the language of the country, but they are easily to be distinguished from the Moslems by the expression of their countenances and sometimes by their blue eyes and light hair. There are also a few families calling themselves Jabaliyah, or mountaineers. Originally they were 100 households, sent by Justinian to serve the convent of St. Catherine, and to defend it against the Berbers.	Sultan Kansuh al-Ghori, called by European writers Campson Gaury, the Mamluk King of Egypt, in A.D. 1501, admitted these people into the Moslem community on condition of their continuing the menial service they had afforded to the monks. [FN#22] Adam's forehead (says the Tarikh Tabari) brushed the skies, but this height being inconvenient, the Lord abridged it to 100 cubits. The Moslems firmly believe in Anakim. Josephus informs us that Moses was of [...] "divine form and great tallness"; the Arabs specify his stature,-300 cubits. They have, moreover, found his grave in some parts of the country S.E, of the Dead Sea, and make cups of a kind of bitumen called [...] "Moses' Stones." [...] This people nescit ignorare-it will know everything. [FN#23] [...] "Moses' Well." [...] I have no argument except the untrustworthy traditions of the Badawin, either for or against this having been the identical well near which Moses sat when he fled from the face of Pharaoh to the land of Midian. One thing is certain, namely, that in this part of Arabia, as also at Aden, the wells are of a very ancient date.|$|E
