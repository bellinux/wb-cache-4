40|$|Tropospheric ozone is a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{produced}} {{in the presence of}} nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and solar radiation. In an urban environment, ground-level vehicular exhaust is the major anthropogenic source of ozone precursors. In the cases of street canyons, pollutant dilution is weakened by the surrounding buildings that creates localized high concentration of NOx and VOCs, and thus leads to high potential of ozone formation. By considering the major physical and chemical processes, a chemistry box model is employed to investigate the characteristics of ozone formation due to vehicular exhaust inside street canyons under the worst case scenario, i. e. the calm wind condition. It is found that a high level of ozone concentration, of the order of 100 ppbv and higher, would occur inside the street canyons, in particular, when the emission rate (concentration) ratio of VOCs to NOx is greater than 10. This elevated ozone concentration appears at the transition from VOCs to NOx sensitivity and may extend to a few hundreds. © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In order to develop {{effective}} air quality policy to minimise ozone pollution, it is important to gain a quantitative understanding of the chemical factors that drive tropospheric ozone production. There are a number of limitations and uncertainties in the current models and indirect methods used to estimate chemical ozone production rates. Here, an Ozone Production Rate (OPR) instrument is developed to fulfil the demand of accurately measuring ambient ozone production rates in the atmosphere. This prototype system aims to directly measure the in situ oxidant (Ox: O 3 + NO 2) production rate p(Ox) in ambient air. This thesis describes the OPR experimental methodology, instrument properties and system characteristics. Two field deployments (London and India) are comprehensively discussed, and correction approaches are implemented to improve measurement accuracy. The field measurement results indicated the measured p(Ox) levels could be used to interpret modelled Ox production rates, and changes in ambient oxidant level.

40|$|Ozone {{is a major}} <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant,</b> {{the current}} {{concentrations}} {{of which have been}} shown to have significant adverse effects on crop yields, forest growth and species composition. In North America and Europe, emissions of ozone precursors are decreasing but in other regions of the world, especially Asia, where much less is known about its impacts, they are increasing rapidly. There is also evidence of an increase in global background ozone concentrations, which will lead to significant changes in global ozone exposure over this century, during which direct and indirect effects of other changes in the global atmosphere will also modify plant responses to ozone. This paper considers how far our current understanding of the mechanisms of ozone impacts, and the tools currently used for ozone risk assessment, are capable of evaluating the consequences of these changing global patterns of exposure to ozone. Risk assessment based on relationships between external concentration and plant response is inadequate for these new challenges. New models linking stomatal flux, and detoxification and repair processes, to carbon assimilation and allocation provide a more mechanistic basis for future risk assessments. However, there are a range of more complex secondary effects of ozone that are not considered in current risk assessment, and there is an urgent need to develop more holistic approaches linking the effects of ozone, climate, and nutrient and water availability, on individual plants, species interactions and ecosystem function...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ozone {{is a major}} <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> often {{reaching}} {{high concentrations}} in urban areas under strong daylight, high temperature and stagnant high-pressure systems. Ozone in the troposphere is a pollutant that is harmful to the plant. Principal Findings: By exposing cells to a strong pulse of ozonized air, an acute cell death was observed in suspension cells of Arabidopsis thaliana used as a model. We demonstrated that O 3 treatment induced the activation of a plasma membrane anion channel that is an early prerequisite of O 3 -induced cell death in A. thaliana. Our data further suggest interplay of anion channel activation with well known plant responses to O 3, Ca 2 + influx and NADPH-oxidase generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating the oxidative cell death. This interplay might be fuelled by several mechanisms {{in addition to the}} direct ROS generation by O 3; namely, H 2 O 2 generation by salicylic and abscisic acids. Anion channel activation was also shown to promote the accumulation of transcripts encoding vacuolar processing enzymes, a family of proteases previously reported to contribute to the disruption of vacuole integrity observed during programmed cell death. Significance: Collectively, our data indicate that anion efflux is an early key component of morphological and biochemical events leading to O 3 -induced programmed cell death. Because ion channels and more specifically anion channels assume a crucial position in cells, an understanding about the underlying role(s) for ion channels in the signalling pathway leading t...|$|E

Ground-level ozone is considered a harmful pollutant due to its adverse impact on human health, agricultural crops and materials. The concern-ing factor is {{that in spite of}} decreasing trends in some other air pollutants (e. g. NOx), ozone concentrations are still increasing. This paper describes the temporal variations of ozone at four air quality monitoring sites (Harwell, Leeds, Marylebone and Strath Vaich) in the United Kingdom for the year of 2008. The association of ozone with some traffi c-related air pollutants has been explored applying a quantile regression model (QRM). The traffi c-related air pollutants considered as predictors for this study are hydrocarbons (HC), nitric oxides (NO), nitrogen dioxides (NO 2), carbon monoxides (CO) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5). QRM can handle the non-linearities in the relationship of ozone and its predictors and is applicable to non-normal air quality data distribution. The behaviour and interaction of ozone with its predictors vary at different regimes of ozone distributions, which remains hidden when applying an ordinary least square regression model. QRM explains signifi cantly more variations in ozone concentrations (global goodness of fi t R 1 = 0. 88) as compared to ordinary least square regression (coeffi cient of determination R 2 = 0. 32) and is therefore better suited for ozone data analysis and prediction...|$|E

In this note we try to identify the ways in which ground level O 3 impact on biodiversity is relevant to the key criteria agreed by the CBD CoP. (a) New evidence of unexpected and significant impacts on biodiversity; Tropospheric ozone (O 3) is a global, <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> impacting human health and ecosystems and an important greenhouse gas resulting in a direct radiative forcing of 0. 35 - 0. 37 W m- 2 on climate (Foster et al., 2007; Shindell et al., 2009).

Current O 3 concentrations are considerably higher in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, with background monthly mean O 3 in the Northern Hemisphere ranging from 35 to 50 ppb (Stevenson et al., 2006).

In this work we examine effects of the climate pattern known as the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and NOx variability on surface ozone from 1990 to 2007 over the South African Highveld, a heavily populated region in South Africa with numerous industrial facilities. Over summer and autumn (December-May) on the Highveld, El Nio, as signified by positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean, is typically associated with drier and warmer than normal conditions favoring ozone formation. Conversely, La Nia, or negative SST anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean, is typically associated with cloudier and above normal rainfall conditions, hindering ozone production. We use a generalized regression model to identify any linear dependence that the Highveld ozone, measured at five air quality monitoring stations, may have on ENSO and NOx. Our results indicate that four out of the five stations exhibit a statistically significant sensitivity to ENSO at some point over the December-May period where El Nio amplifies ozone formation and La Nia reduces ozone formation. Three out of the five stations reveal statistically significant sensitivity to NOx variability, primarily in winter and spring. Accounting for ENSO and NOx effects throughout the study period of 18 years, two stations exhibit statistically significant negative ozone trends in spring, one station displays a statistically significant positive trend in August, and two stations show no statistically significant change in surface ozone...|$|E

Involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PAN toxicity was suggested by PAN-dependently increased intracellular H 2 O 2 and also by the cell-protective effects of ROS scavengers and related inhibitors. Calcium chelator also lowered the level of PAN-induced cell death, indicating that Ca 2 + is also involved. Using a transgenic cell line expressing aequorin, an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration responsive to the pulse of PAN, but sensitive to Ca 2 + channel blockers, was recorded, indicating that Ca 2 + channels are activated by PAN or PAN-derived signals.

Specifically, the phytotoxic nature of O- 3 can impair CO 2 assimilation that, in turn affects forest productivity. This study aims to evaluate the effects of tropospheric O- 3 on Gross Primary Production (GPP) at 37 European forest sites during the time period 2000 - 2010. Due {{to the lack of}} carbon assimilation data at O- 3 monitoring stations (and vice-versa) this study makes a first attempt to combine high resolution MODIS Gross Primary Production (GPP) estimates and O- 3 measurement data. Partial Correlations, Anomalies Analysis and the Random Forests Analysis (RFA) were used to quantify the effects of tropospheric O- 3 concentration and its uptake on GPP and to evaluate the most important factors affecting inter-annual GPP changes. Our results showed, along a North-West/South-East European transect, a negative impact of O- 3 on GPP ranging from 0. 4 % to 30 %, although a key role of meteorological parameters respect to pollutant variables in affecting GPP was found. In particular, meteorological parameters, namely air temperature (T), soil water content (SWC) and relative humidity (RH) are the most important predictors at 81 % of test sites. Moreover, it is interesting to highlight a key role of SWC in the Mediterranean areas (Spanish, Italian and French test sites) confirming that, soil moisture and soil water availability affect vegetation growth and photosynthesis especially in arid or semi-arid ecosystems such as the Mediterranean climate regions.

40|$|Surface ozone is a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{produced}} during the atmospheric photochemical degradation of emitted {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) {{in the presence of}} sunlight and nitrogen oxides (NO x). Temperature directly influences ozone production through speeding up the rates of chemical reactions and increasing the emissions of VOCs, such as isoprene, from vegetation. In this study, we used an idealised box model with different chemical mechanisms (Master Chemical Mechanism, MCMv 3. 2; Common Representative Intermediates, CRIv 2; Model for OZone and Related Chemical Tracers, MOZART- 4; Regional Acid Deposition Model, RADM 2; Carbon Bond Mechanism, CB 05) to examine the non-linear relationship between ozone, NO x and temperature, and we compared this to previous observational studies. Under high-NO x conditions, an increase in ozone from 20 to 40  °C of up to 20  ppbv was due to faster reaction rates, while increased isoprene emissions added up to a further 11  ppbv of ozone. The largest inter-mechanism differences were obtained at high temperatures and high-NO x emissions. CB 05 and RADM 2 simulated more NO x -sensitive chemistry than MCMv 3. 2, CRIv 2 and MOZART- 4, which could lead to different mitigation strategies being proposed depending on the chemical mechanism. The increased oxidation rate of emitted VOC with temperature controlled the rate of O x production; the net influence of peroxy nitrates increased net O x production per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised. The rate of increase in ozone mixing ratios with temperature from our box model simulations was about half the rate of increase in ozone with temperature observed over central Europe or simulated by a regional chemistry transport model. Modifying the box model set-up to approximate stagnant meteorological conditions increased the rate of increase of ozone with temperature as the accumulation of oxidants enhanced ozone production through the increased production of peroxy radicals from the secondary degradation of emitted VOCs. The box model simulations approximating stagnant conditions and the maximal ozone production chemical regime reproduced the 2  ppbv increase in ozone per degree Celsius from the observational and regional model data over central Europe. The simulated ozone–temperature relationship was more sensitive to mixing than the choice of chemical mechanism. Our analysis suggests that reductions in NO x emissions would be required to offset the additional ozone production due to an increase in temperature in the future...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone is a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{which is}} formed during {{chemical}} reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) {{in the presence of}} solar radiation. Ozone enters the plant leaf mainly through the stomata. Inside the leaf, the oxidizing potential of ozone and the resulting formation of radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) make ozone highly phytotoxic. Ozone exposure thus can cause visible foliar injury, biomass reduction and increased leaf senescence, as well as alteration in the assimilate partitioning. The background for this thesis is that there are indications of that plants growing under Nordic conditions seem less tolerant to ozone than plants which grow further south in Europe. Thus, the main aim of this thesis was to compare the reaction to ozone exposure of plants growing under a long daylength and plants growing under a short daylength. Three experiments were performed where long day plants of the genus Trifolium were grown under controlled conditions in a phytotron. In experiment I, 52 d old plants of T. subterraneum were investigated, in experiment II 21 d old plants of T. subterraneum were investigated whereas in experiment III, 31 d old plants of T. subterraneum, T. pratense var. Bjursele and T. repens var. Norstar were investigated. To study the effect of daylength in relation to ozone exposure, the plants were subjected to the same daily ozone dose (0 ppb or 70 ppb for 3 d for 6 h day- 1) and grown under different photoperiods where the only factor varying was the light during the night period (long day: 10 h PAR/ 14 h dim light, short day: 10 h PAR/ 14 dark). The different daylength treatments resulted in different degree of visible ozone-induced foliar injury; LD induced significantly more visible ozone- induced foliar injury in 21 and 52 days old plants of Trifolium subterraneum and 31 days old plants of Trifolium pratense compared to SD. The LD promoted visible ozone-injury was mostly accompanied by an increase in the above ground biomass. The LD treated plants thus might have been using a greater proportion of their metabolic gain in order to grow {{at the expense of the}} repair of the ozone-induced damage. Other explanations involve increased ethylene formation under LD conditions, or that a photoreceptor (e. g. phytochrome) activates the defense system to a higher degree under SD - than under LD conditions. In experiment III, two new methods to detect ozone stress were investigated by using an infrared camera. By using passive thermography, parallel digital and infrared imaging of the leaves of T. subterraneum and T. pratense revealed an ozone induced change in the temperature. In the fourth trifoliate leaf of T. subterraneum, there was a significant increase in the leaf temperature after three days of ozone exposure, and an increase in the temperature of the fifth trifoliate leaf after two days of ozone exposure. In Trifolium pratense there was a temperature decrease in the third trifoliate leaf after 3 days of ozone exposure. These temperature changes were not dependent on visible ozone-induced foliar injury. As the leaf temperature might be an indirect measure of the transpiration, the different responses can possibly be related to stomatal behaviour. Other additional or alternative explanations might involve changes in the internal structure of the leaves, or changed biochemical events which might affect the leaf temperature. Leaves of all the Trifolium species were also subjected to active thermography where the leaf temperature responses were recorded before, during and after a 25 s light pulse. The time constant (ô) was calculated and used as an indicator of how quickly the temperature cools down to the leaf s temperature before the light pulse. In addition, the maximum temperature differences due to the light pulse were compared. The results showed an indication towards a decrease in the maximum temperature difference, followed by an increase in the time for cooling in ozone-exposed leaves of T. subterraneum and T. pratense. T. repens seemed to respond in an opposite manner, and showed a less stable temperature response. The use of thermography seems to be a supplementary method to investigate ozone stress as it is non-destructive and has the potential to detect ozone injury before it becomes apparent...|$|E

40|$|For <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> {{precursor}} emissions may impact {{concentrations in}} nonlinear and interdependent manners. We explore the nonlinear responses {{of one such}} pollutant, ozone, to emissions of its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds. Modeling is conducted for a high ozone episode in the southeastern United States, applying a second-order direct sensitivity method in a regional air quality model. As applied here, the sensitivity method neglects most aerosol and aqueous chemistry processes. Inclusion of second-order sensitivities is shown to enable accurate characterization of response to large perturbations in emissions. An index is introduced to characterize the nonlinearity of ozone response to NO_x emitted from each source region. Nonlinearity is found to increase with the tonnage and emission density of the source region. Interactions among the impacts of emission sources are shown to lead to discrepancies between source contribution attributed to an ensemble of emitters and {{the sum of the}} contributions attributed to each component. A method is introduced for applying these “cross-sensitivity” interactions to assess the uncertainty of sensitivity and source apportionment estimates arising from uncertainty in an emissions inventory. For ozone response to NO_x, underestimates in emission rates lead to underprediction of total source contribution but overprediction of per-ton sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Air Quality Forecasting System (AAQFS) is the {{culmination}} of a 3 -yr project to develop a numerical primitive equation system for generating high-resolution (1 – 5 km) short-term (24 – 36 h) forecasts for the Australian coastal cities of Melbourne and Sydney. Forecasts are generated 2 times per day for a range of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particles that are less than 10 μm in diameter (PM 10). A preliminary assessment of system performance has been undertaken using forecasts generated over a 3 -month demonstration period. For the priority pollutant ozone it was found that AAQFS achieved a coefficient of determination of 0. 65 and 0. 57 for forecasts of peak daily 1 -h concentration in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively. The probability of detection and false-alarm rate were 0. 71 and 0. 55, respectively, for a 60 -ppb forecast threshold in Melbourne. A similar level of skill was achieved for Sydney. System performance is also promising for the primary gaseous pollutants. Further development is required before the system can be used to forecast PM 10 confidently, with a systematic overprediction of 24 -h PM 10 concentration occurring during the winter months. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Wildland {{fires are}} {{major sources of}} trace gases and aerosol, and these {{emissions}} are believed to significantly influence the chemical composition of the atmosphere and the earth’s climate system. The wide variety of pollutants released by wildland fire include green-house gases, photochemically reactive compounds, and fine and coarse particulate matter. Through direct emissions and secondary chemical and physical processes, wildland fire can {{have a significant impact}} on tropospheric chemistry and serve as a major source of air pollution. We provide a synthesis of emission factor data from the literature and previously unpublished research for use in global, continental and regional scale studies investigating the role of wildland fire emissions in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The emission factor data is presented by geographic zones (boreal, temperate, and tropical) and vegetation group (forest and savanna/ rangeland), allowing researchers to account for the different emission characteristics exhibited by biomass burning in these disparate regions. A brief overview of the wildland fuel combustion process as related to emissions production is also provided. The atmospheric fate of wildland fire emissions is briefly discussed and related to the production of <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Previously unpublished results from a series of fire emission studies in the United States and Canada are presented in an appendix.

40|$|Ozone-driven {{chemistry}} {{is a major}} source of indoor secondary pollutants of health concern. This study investigates <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> formed from reactions between constituents of household products and ozone. Gas-phase product emissions were introduced along with ozone at constant rates into a 198 -L Teflon-lined reaction chamber. Gas-phase concentrations of reactive terpenoids and oxidation products were measured. Formaldehyde was a predominant oxidation byproduct for the three studied products, with yields under most conditions of 20 - 30 % with respect to ozone consumed. Acetaldehyde, acetone, glycolaldehyde, formic acid and acetic acid were each also detected for two or three of the products. Immediately upon mixing of reactants, a scanning mobility particle sizer detected particle nucleation events that were followed by a significant degree of ultrafine particle growth. The production of secondary gaseous pollutants and particles depended primarily on the ozone level and was influenced by other parameters such as the air-exchange rate. Hydroxyl radical concentrations in the range 0. 04 - 200 x 10 {sup 5 } molecules cm{sup - 3 } were measured. OH concentrations were observed to vary strongly with residual ozone level in the chamber, which was in the range 1 - 25 ppb, as is consistent with expectations from a simplified kinetic model. In a separate test, we exposed the dry residue of two products to ozone in the chamber and observed the formation of gas-phase and particle-phase secondary oxidation products...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} an {{analysis}} of continuous Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> (SO 2, NO 2 and O 3) in the Athens basin is performed combined with Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) vertical ozone measurements obtained inside the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and the lower free troposphere. The measurements {{took place during the}} period May 2005 -February 2007, at the National Technical University of Athens Campus (200 m above sea level (asl.), 37. 96 °N, 23. 78 °E). The SO 2 and NO 2 DOAS measurements showed maximum 1 -hour mean values (around 20 μg/m 3 and 74 μg/m 3, respectively) in winter and did not exceed the current European Union (EU) air quality standards (European Council Directive 2008 / 50 /EC), in contrast to ozone, which shows its maximum (around 128 μg/m 3) in summer and frequently exceeds the EU standard for human health protection (120 μg/m 3). If the measurements are classified according to the two most frequent flow-patterns of the air masses in the Athens basin (northern-southern circulation), it is observed that in general the atmospheric concentrations of all measured pollutants including ozone are higher when the southern circulation occurs, in comparison to the corresponding values under the northern circulation. The vertical ozone profiles obtained by DIAL were also higher under the southern circulation. During the summer months a mean difference (between the southern-northern circulations) of the order of 15 - 20 μg/m 3, maximized at the 0. 9 - 1. 1 km and 1. 7 - 1. 8 km height, was observed within the PBL. It was also observed that the summer surface ozone levels remained relatively high (around 80 - 110 μg/m 3) even during strong northerly winds, verifying the high levels of rural surface ozone in the surrounding area reported by previous studies. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) {{is one of}} the {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOx) pollutants. Not only the NO 2 itself is toxic to human health, but also the precursors of a number of hazardous <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> such as nitric acid, tropospheric ozone and nitrate component of particulate matters. Besides, NO 2 is also an essential substances involving in ozone destruction in the stratosphere. The main source of NO 2 over urban is combustion processes from traffic. Jeopardized by the severe situation, the monitoring and observation to this harmful trace gas is important. For urban regions, the in-situ and remote sensing techniques are combined. However, these measurements can be problematic due to the meteorological conditions or atmospheric processes, such as clouds. Besides, the retrieval of the measurements provides limited information on concentration fields under various a-priori assumptions. Alternatively, the atmospheric dispersion modeling is in use to study the air quality, which provides a more complete deterministic description of pollutants dispersion problem. Currently, the dominating atmospheric dispersion models are based on the parameterization. These models are efficient to simulate meso-scale or macro-scale atmospheric dispersion, with spatial resolution of magnitude of kilometers. Considering on urban scale, however, this resolution is too coarse to resolve the <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> where the emission sources are close to receptors. Instead, a more effective technique is large eddy simulation (LES). It applies a low-pass filter that effective removes small-scale turbulences from numerical calculation. By nesting DALES (Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation) into LOTOS-EUROS (LOng Term Ozone Simulation-EURopean Operational Smog model), an air quality module is developed to evaluate the LES-based air quality model by comparing with LOTOS-EUROS. The conclusion of this thesis consists of two parts. The first one is the sensitivity study, where the properties of DALES original chemical module are explored. These properties includes the sensitivity of NO 2 concentration to background ozone level, reaction rate coefficient, clouds perturbation and turbulent control. In the second part, simulation over Rotterdam is operated on a relative coarse resolution, as the consequence of the limitation of restore space and process capability. The slab averaged profiles are not significantly different because of the strongly constrained concentration boundary condition by LOTOS-EUROS. Although attempt to study the difference of concentration field due to the dynamics scheme is not achieved, DALES still has much higher resolution compared with LOTOS-EUROS. Hence, the spatial variability in DALES is more detailed. Conclusively, the DALES air quality module performs consistently with LOTOS-EUROS. The improvement in terms of chemical mechanism, the emission inventory, the capability of processing. etc. will complete this module in future.

40|$|Non-methane {{volatile}} organic compounds (NMVOCs) influence air quality and global climate change through their effects on <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> and climate forcers. Here we simulate the air quality and radiative forcing (RF) impacts of changes in ozone, methane, and sulfate from halving anthropogenic NMVOC emissions globally and from 10 regions individually, using a global chemical transport model and a standalone radiative transfer model. Halving global NMVOC emissions decreases global annual average tropospheric methane and ozone by 36. 6 ppbv and 3. 3 Tg, respectively, and surface ozone by 0. 67 ppbv. All regional reductions slow the production of PAN, resulting in regional to intercontinental PAN decreases and regional NO x increases. These NO x increases drive tropospheric ozone increases nearby or downwind of source regions in the Southern Hemisphere (South America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Australia). Some regions' NMVOC emissions contribute importantly to air pollution in other regions, such as East Asia, Middle East, and Europe, whose impact on US surface ozone is 43 %, 34 %, and 34 % of North America's impact. Global and regional NMVOC reductions produce widespread negative net RFs (cooling) across both hemispheres from tropospheric ozone and methane decreases, and regional warming and cooling from changes in tropospheric ozone and sulfate (via several oxidation pathways). The total global net RF for NMVOCs is estimated as 0. 0277 W m − 2 (~ 1. 8 % of CO 2 RF since the preindustrial). The 100 yr and 20 yr global warming potentials (GWP 100, GWP 20) are 2. 36 and 5. 83 for the global reduction, and 0. 079 to 6. 05 and − 1. 13 to 18. 9 among the 10 regions. The NMVOC RF and GWP estimates are generally lower than previously modeled estimates, due to differences among models in ozone, methane, and sulfate sensitivities, and the climate forcings included in each estimate. Accounting for a~fuller set of RF contributions may change the relative magnitude of each region's impacts. The large variability in the RF and GWP of NMVOCs among regions suggest that regionally-specific metrics {{may be necessary to}} include NMVOCs in multi-gas climate trading schemes...|$|R

Data from this campaign provided an opportunity to examine and improve our understanding of atmospheric photochemical oxidation processes related {{to the formation of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as ozone (O 3). O 3 production and its sensitivity to NO x and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were calculated at different locations and times of day. Ozone production efficiency (OPE), defined as the ratio of the ozone production rate to the NO x oxidation rate, was calculated using the observations and the simulation results of the box and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. Correlations of these results with other parameters, such as radical sources and NO x mixing ratio, were also evaluated. It was generally found that O 3 production tends to be more VOC-sensitive in the morning along with high ozone production rates, suggesting that control of VOCs may be an effective way to control O 3 in Houston. In the afternoon, O 3 production was found to be mainly NO x -sensitive with some exceptions. O 3 production near major emissions sources such as Deer Park was mostly VOC-sensitive for the entire day, other urban areas near Moody Tower and Channelview were VOC-sensitive or in the transition regime, and areas farther from downtown Houston such as Smith Point and Conroe were mostly NO x -sensitive for the entire day. It was also found that the control of NO x emissions has reduced O 3 concentrations over Houston but has led to larger OPE values. The results from this work strengthen our understanding of O 3 production; they indicate that controlling NO x emissions will provide air quality benefits over the greater Houston metropolitan area in the long run, but in selected areas controlling VOC emissions will also be beneficial...|$|R
