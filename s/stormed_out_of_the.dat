5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero {{should be able to}} identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conference.|$|E

His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room and refused to give an answer.|$|E

Brunne denied that the speech was directed against a specific party.|$|E
25|$|The UMNO {{leaders were}} also sceptical of the idea; {{there was some}} {{distrust}} of the PAP government, and some were concerned that a merger with Singapore, with its large urban Chinese population, would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue {{came to a head}} in 1961, when Ong Eng Guan, a long-standing member of the PAP, <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent by-election, a move that threatened to bring down Lee's government.|$|E

25|$|Although he was hot-headed, Michael was {{convinced}} {{to cool the}} debate and thus attempt to prevent the impending breach. However, Humbert and the pope made no concessions and the former was sent with legatine powers to the imperial capital to solve the questions raised once and for all. Humbert, Frederick of Lorraine, and Peter, Archbishop of Amalfi arrived in April 1054 and were met with a hostile reception; they <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace, leaving the papal response with Michael, who in turn was even more angered by their actions. The patriarch refused to recognise their authority or, practically, their existence. When Pope Leo died on April 19, 1054, the legates' authority legally ceased, but they effectively ignored this technicality.|$|E

25|$|The Nazis and Germany's {{professional}} diplomats {{shared the}} goal of destroying the Treaty of Versailles and restoring Germany as a great power. In October 1933, German Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath presented a note at the World Disarmament Conference announcing that it was unfair that Germany should remain disarmed by Part V of the Versailles treaty and demanded that the other powers either disarm to Germany's level, or that they abolish Part V and allow Germany Gleichberechtigung ("equality of armaments"). When France rejected Neurath's note, Germany <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. It all but announced its intention to unilaterally violate Part V. Consequently, there were several calls in France that autumn for a preventive war {{to put an end}} to the Nazi regime while Germany was still more-or-less disarmed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1910, Welsh was finding it {{difficult}} to find a fight. Wolgast was pricing himself out of the market, McFarland could not reach the weight and the National Sporting Centre could not find a credible contender to challenge for the Lonsdale Belt. Jim Driscoll, who had earlier won the flyweight Lonsdale Belt, was in a similar situation and a highly anticipated match was arranged between them. Two uninspiring fights were arranged before the Driscoll encounter in December, a sixth round win over middleweight Joe Heathcote and then a ninth round stoppage over Dick Bailey. A long build up to the game caused the relationship between Welsh and Driscoll to sour, and when they met to sign the contracts, an argument broke out between the two men over the choice of referee. Driscoll lost his temper with Welsh, became verbally abusive and <b>stormed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meeting.|$|E
