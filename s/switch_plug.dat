40|$|Action {{completion}} detection is {{the problem}} of modelling the action's progression towards localising the moment of completion - when the action's goal is confidently considered achieved. In this work, we assess the ability of two temporal models, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to localise completion for six object interactions: <b>switch,</b> <b>plug,</b> open, pull, pick and drink. We use a supervised approach, where annotations of pre-completion and post-completion frames are available per action, and fine-tuned CNN features are used to train temporal models. Tested on the Action-Completion- 2016 dataset, we detect completion within 10 frames of annotations for ~ 75 % of completed action sequences using both temporal models. Results show that fine-tuned CNN features outperform hand-crafted features for localisation, and that observing incomplete instances is necessary when incomplete sequences are also present in the test set...|$|E

50|$|Later Otto engines {{employed}} a small magneto {{directly on the}} engine. Rather than tripping a <b>switch,</b> the spark <b>plug</b> firing arm applies a quick rotation to the magneto rotor, which then snaps back under spring tension.

50|$|In {{the family}} of dialkyl phosphinic acid salts, {{aluminium}} diethyl phosphinate {{has been found to}} be an excellent flame retardant for use in engineering plastics such as polyamides, polyesters, thermosets and elastomers. It was developed by Hoechst, later by Clariant chemicals and Ticona.In 2004 and 2012, Clariant chemicals opened its first and second commercial production lines respectively in Huerth-Knapsack near Cologne.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack. In parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals H. and OH., which determine flame propagation and heat release.The phosphinate partly vaporises and partly decomposes to volatile diethyl phosphinic acid and an aluminium phosphate residue, which acts as a barrier for fuel and heat transport.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is used as a halogen-free flame retardant for polyamides, polyesters, thermoset resins (e.g. epoxies) in electrical engineering and electronics (E&E) applications for <b>switches,</b> <b>plugs,</b> PC fans, and structural and housing components. Smartphones, washing machines, and airplane parts, among others, contain the product. Other applications include thermosetting resins and adhesives as well as cable sheaths and insulation made from thermoplastic elastomers. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate can give these plastics flame retardant properties that are otherwise only achievable with expensive high-performance plastics, which are less easy to work with. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is often used in combination with other halogen-free flame retardant additives like melamine polyphosphate or melamine cyanurate.|$|R

The stabilizer compensates for two axes, pitch and roll, as well as vertical movement. The system (currently only compatible with one cell phone model) is handheld and uses a combination of brushless DC motors, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a microcontroller to compensate for the operator’s movements, stabilizing the phone for nonshaky, high quality video recording. The stabilizer provides a lowcost alternative to professional stabilization solutions employed in the production of featurelength films; the system is designed for amateur video producers and enthusiasts to have access to physical camera stabilization. The final system is also intended to provide higher quality stabilization than the rudimentary physical (i. e. springs and counterweights) or software (postproduction) solutions available now.

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{model was}} applied to the passenger door unit of a fleet of 38 Class 380 trains operating on Scotland’s railway network. The data required for the analysis were collected from the literature, the company’s maintenance management software system called EQUINOX, the UK’s railway performance management software DATASYS BUGLE and the UK’s train movements monitoring system called TRUST. The five why’s technique was used to identify the potential failure modes of door unit components and their root causes, including the defects in relation to pushbuttons, door control unit (DCU), mechanical failures, light barrier, door drive, guard operating panel (GOP), limit <b>switches,</b> loose <b>plugs,</b> obstructions, door roller and lubrication. The results of the risk evaluation showed that the nine failure modes (12  % {{of the total number of}} failure modes identified) are “high critical” to door system functionality. The results of this study were used not only for assessing the performance of current maintenance practices, but also to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance (PM) programme for different components of rolling stock. To avoid the recurrence of the failure modes, a new mileage-based preventive maintenance (PM) programme including 14 tasks was proposed.|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective <b>switch,</b> socket, <b>plug,</b> wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R

Homes were often built of sod, heated with wood-fired stoves, and lit with candles they made themselves. The majority of twenty-first century Canadians would perish in similar living conditions. The Canadian Encyclopaedia in its history of Western and Northwest Canada describes the lives of the pioneer homesteaders who purchased 160 acres of land for $ 10 and struggled to survive. “Homesteaders and their families were often separated from friends and relatives, and many suffered years of hardship and loneliness. One of the greatest difficulties was the absence of roads and bridges. Most trails were impassable when wet. Medical care was scarce and farm injuries were often crippling or fatal, and many simple ailments caused prolonged hardship. For many settlers the price of homesteading was too high, they cancelled their claims and moved away” (McCracken, 2011). Today, off-grid living is sought out for different reasons.

Wind power installed {{capacity in the}} UK and Nordic systems is increasing dramatically in recent years. However, one cannot precisely predict renewable energy output: if wind stops blowing, turbines don’t produce electricity. Moreover, we expect to receive power whenever we <b>switch</b> on or <b>plug</b> in electrical appliances. Since electricity cannot be stored efficiently, reserves must be available to continuously match the difference between generation and consumption. The number of occasions in which not enough reserves are available is growing because of renewable generation, increasing the risk of blackout.

This poster concentrates on flexible use of industrial plants, which can vary their electricity consumption and act as reserves whenever an imbalance arises. However, since flexibility is only a by-product of the plant, special care is devoted to assure stable and safe operation of the main industrial production: for instance, a plant that uses electricity to liquefy metal at high temperatures may reduce its power consumption for some time, provided that the metal doesn’t solidify. Industrial load flexibility is the largest unexploited resource in power system reliability: frequency control schemes must be revisited in light of load participation.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} an electrical safety program that incorporates all workers into the program, not just the electrical workers. It is largely in response to a paper presented at the 2012 ESW by Lanny Floyd entitled "Facilitating Application of Electrical Safety Best Practices to "Other" Workers" which requested all attendees to review their electrical safety program to assure that non-electrical workers were protected as well as electrical workers. The referenced paper indicated that roughly 50 % of electrical incidents involve workers whose primary function is not electrical in nature. It also encouraged all to "address electrical safety for all workers and not just workers whose job responsibilities involve working on or near energized electrical circuits. " In this paper, a program which includes specific briefings to non-electrical workers as well as to workers who may need to perform their normal activities in proximity to energized electrical conductors is presented. The program uses a targeted approach to specific areas such as welding, excavating, rigging, chart reading, <b>switching,</b> cord and <b>plug</b> equipment and several other general areas to point out hazards that may exist and how to avoid them. NFPA 70 E- 2004 was incorporated into the program several years ago and with it the need to include the "other" workers became apparent. The site experience over the years supports the assertion that about half of the electrical incidents involve non-electrical workers and this prompted us to develop specific briefings to enhance the knowledge of the non-electrical worker regarding safe electrical practices.

40|$|Copper–graphite {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} possess {{the properties of}} copper, i. e. excellent thermal and electrical conductivities, and properties of graphite, i. e. solid lubricating and small thermal expansion coefficient. They are widely used as brushes, and bearing materials because of the above properties. Copper-graphite with low percentages of graphite is also used for slip rings, <b>switches,</b> relays, connectors, <b>plugs</b> and low voltage DC machines with very high current densities. In the present investigation, {{attempts have been made}} for the fabrication of Cu-graphite MMC by conventional and spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques. The MMCs were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different mechanical properties like density, bulk hardness and wear study were also conducted. XRD spectra show the presence of Cu, graphite and Cu 2 O peaks which shows that no interaction between Cu and graphite takes place during fabrication. The presence of a weak peak of Cu 2 O proves that slight oxidation of Cu takes place during sintering. It has been found that addition of graphite into copper does not result in much improvement in hardness due to the soft nature of graphite. However, 90 % and 97 % of theoretical density have been obtained for conventional sintered and SPS samples respectively. Maximum Vickers hardness value of around 100 has been achieved for Cu- 1 vol. % graphite MMC when it is fabricated by SPS. However, a hardness value of 65 has been obtained for the same composite when it is fabricated by conventional sintering at 900 °C for 1 hour. The micrographs of Cu-graphite reflect the clean interface and good compatibility between matrix and reinforcement. From wear study, it is concluded that the wear resistance of the composite increases with increase in graphite content due to the lubricating properties of graphite. It has also been found that wear depth decreases with increase in graphite content. SPS sintered samples show higher wear resistance than conventional sintered samples...|$|R
