40|$|Dual-parameter inductive-capacitive (LC) {{resonant}} sensor {{is gradually}} becoming the measurement trend in complex harsh environments; however, the coupling between inductors greatly affects the <b>readout</b> <b>signal,</b> which becomes {{very difficult to}} resolve by means of simple mathematical tools. By changing the values of specific variables in a MATLAB code, the influence of coupling between coils on the <b>readout</b> <b>signal</b> is analyzed. Our preliminary conclusions underline that changing the coupling to antenna greatly affects the <b>readout</b> <b>signal,</b> but it simultaneously influences the other signal. When f 01 =f 02, {{it is better to}} broaden {{the difference between the two}} coupling coefficients k 1 and k 2. On the other side, when f 01 is smaller than f 02, it is better to decrease the coupling between sensor inductors k 12, in order to obtain two <b>readout</b> <b>signals</b> averaged in strength.

50|$|Phase {{modulated}} light, {{consisting of}} a carrier frequency and two side bands, is directed onto a two-mirror cavity. Light reflected off the cavity is measured using a high speed photodetector, the reflected signal consists of the two unaltered side bands along with a phase shifted carrier component. The photodetector signal is mixed down with a local oscillator, which is in phase with the light modulation. After phase shifting and filtering, the resulting electronic signal gives {{a measure of how}} far the laser carrier is off resonance with the cavity and may be used as feedback for active stabilization. The feedback is typically carried out using a PID Controller which takes the PDH error <b>signal</b> <b>readout</b> and converts it into a voltage that can be fed back to the laser to keep it locked on resonance with the cavity.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{performance}} of 8 -input superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) for multiplexing transition-edge sensor signals by using frequency-domain multiplexing. We found the typical critical current and the flux noise to be 17 - 19 μA and 0. 7 - 1. 1 μΦ 0 /Hz, respectively. We also measured the crosstalk current between the input coils of the SQUIDs, {{and found that}} the mutual inductance was consistent with the design value, 800 pH. We confirmed that the cross talk current due to the mutual inductance was reduced by the flux-locked-loop (FLL) feedback, and its reduction rate was consistent with 1 /(1 +L), where L is the FLL feedback gain.

50|$|The first {{demonstrations of}} the superconducting transition's {{measurement}} potential {{appeared in the}} 1940s, thirty years after Onnes's discovery of superconductivity. D.H. Andrews demonstrated the first transition-edge bolometer, a current-biased tantalum wire which he used to measure an infrared signal. Subsequently he demonstrated a transition-edge calorimeter made of niobium nitride which {{was used to measure}} alpha particles. However, the TES detector did not gain popularity for about 50 years, due primarily to the difficulty of <b>signal</b> <b>readout</b> from such a low-impedance system. A second obstacle to the adoption of TES detectors was in achieving stable operation in the narrow superconducting transition region. Joule heating in a current-biased TES can lead to thermal runaway that drives the detector into the normal (non-superconducting) state, a phenomenon known as positive electrothermal feedback. The thermal runaway problem was solved in 1995 by K. D. Irwin by voltage biasing the TES, establishing stable negative electrothermal feedback, and coupling them to superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) current amplifiers. This breakthrough has led to widespread adoption of TES detectors.|$|E

We {{found that the}} responses to cytokinin signaling during Arabidopsis development are constrained by the transporter PURINE PERMEASE 14 (PUP 14). In our experiments, the expression of PUP 14 was inversely correlated to the cytokinin <b>signaling</b> <b>readout.</b> Loss of PUP 14 function allowed ectopic cytokinin signaling accompanied by aberrant morphogenesis in embryos, roots, and the shoot apical meristem. PUP 14 protein localized to the plasma membrane and imported bioactive cytokinins, thus depleting apoplastic cytokinin pools and inhibiting perception by plasma membrane–localized cytokinin sensors to create a sink for active ligands. We propose that the spatiotemporal cytokinin sink patterns established by PUP 14 determine the cytokinin signaling landscape that shapes the morphogenesis of land plants...|$|R
40|$|SummaryContact-dependent {{signaling}} between membrane-linked ligands and receptors {{such as the}} ephrins and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases controls a {{wide range}} of developmental and pathological processes. Paradoxically, many cell types coexpress both ligands and receptors, raising the question of how specific <b>signaling</b> <b>readouts</b> are achieved under these conditions. Here, we studied the signaling activities exerted by coexpressed EphA receptors and GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands in spinal motor neuron growth cones. We demonstrate that coexpressed Eph and ephrin proteins segregate laterally into distinct membrane domains from which they signal opposing effects on the growth cone: EphAs direct growth cone collapse/repulsion and ephrin-As signal motor axon growth/attraction. This subcellular arrangement of Eph-ephrin proteins enables axons to discriminate between cis- versus trans-configurations of ligand/receptor proteins, thereby allowing the utilization of both Ephs and ephrins as functional guidance receptors within the same neuronal growth cone...|$|R

40|$|Abelson (Abl) family {{tyrosine}} kinases {{have been}} implicated in cell morphogenesis, adhesion, motility, and oncogenesis. Using a candidate approach for genes involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, we identified Drosophila Abl (dAbl) as a modulator of Frizzled(Fz) /PCP signaling. We demonstrate that dAbl positively regulates the Fz/Dishevelled (Dsh) PCP pathway without affecting canonical Wnt/Wg–Fz signaling. Genetic dissection suggests that Abl functions via Fz/Dsh signaling in photoreceptor R 3 specification, a well-established Fz–PCP <b>signaling</b> <b>readout.</b> Molecular analysis shows that dAbl binds and phosphorylates Dsh on Tyr 473 within the DEP domain. This phosphorylation event on Dsh is functionally critical, as the equivalent DshY 473 F mutant is nonfunctional in PCP signaling and stable membrane association, although it rescues canonical Wnt signaling. Strikingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for Abl 1 and Abl 2 /Arg genes also show reduced Dvl 2 phosphorylation as compared with control MEFs, and this correlates with a change in subcellular localization of endogenous Dvl 2. As in Drosophila, such Abl-deficient MEFs show no change in canonical Wnt signaling. Taken together, our results argue for a conserved role of Abl family members in the positive regulation of Dsh activity toward Fz–Dsh/PCP signaling by Dsh phosphorylation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Androgen {{deprivation}} therapy (ADT) {{is initially}} effective in treating metastatic prostate cancer, and secondary hormonal therapies are being tested to suppress androgen receptor (AR) reactivation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite variable responses to AR pathway inhibitors in CRPC, {{there are no}} reliable biomarkers to guide their application. Here, we used microfl uidic capture of circulating tumor cells (CTC) to measure AR <b>signaling</b> <b>readouts</b> before and after therapeutic interventions. Single-cell immunofl uorescence analysis revealed predomi-nantly “AR-on ” CTC signatures in untreated patients, compared with heterogeneous (“AR-on, AR-off, and AR-mixed”) CTC populations in patients with CRPC. Initiation of fi rst-line ADT induced a profound switch from “AR-on ” to “AR-off ” CTCs, whereas secondary hormonal therapy in CRPC resulted in vari-able responses. Presence of “AR-mixed ” CTCs and increasing “AR-on ” cells despite treatment with abi-raterone acetate were associated with an adverse treatment outcome. Measuring treatment-induced signaling responses within CTCs may help guide therapy in prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Acquired resistance to fi rst-line hormonal therapy in prostate cancer is heterogeneous in the extent of AR pathway reactivation.
