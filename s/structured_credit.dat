40|$|We {{examine the}} link between volume and {{liquidity}} in money markets where there are close substitutes.

Controlling for interest-rate levels, day-of-the-week, calendar, term <b>structure,</b> <b>credit</b> spread, time-series, and cross-equation effects, we find that the substitution effect does not eliminate the impact of market-size changes on rates, but it does preserve the hierarchy of rates across instruments.

This suggests {{that the use of}} cross-acceleration provisions increases when the costs of cascading defaults are lower, the conflicts between creditor classes are higher, and the benefits of delegating monitoring to banks are higher. We also find a lower interest rate on public debt contracts with cross-acceleration provisions, but the rate reduction depends on borrowers' financial reporting quality...|$|R

5000|$|On June 22, 2007, Bear Stearns pledged a collateralized loan {{of up to}} $3.2 {{billion to}} [...] "bail out" [...] one of its funds, the Bear Stearns High-Grade <b>Structured</b> <b>Credit</b> Fund, while {{negotiating}} with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund, the Bear Stearns High-Grade <b>Structured</b> <b>Credit</b> Enhanced Leveraged Fund. Bear Stearns had originally put up just $25 million, so they were hesitant about the bailout; nonetheless, CEO James Cayne and other senior executives worried about {{the damage to the}} company's reputation. The funds were invested in thinly traded collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Merrill Lynch seized $850 million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction $100 million of them. The incident sparked concern of contagion as Bear Stearns might be forced to liquidate its CDOs, prompting a mark-down of similar assets in other portfolios. Richard A. Marin, a senior executive at Bear Stearns Asset Management responsible for the two hedge funds, was replaced on June 29 by Jeffrey B. Lane, a former Vice Chairman of rival investment bank, Lehman Brothers.|$|E

40|$|A firm's {{instantaneous}} {{probability of}} default is modeled as a square-root diffusion process. The parameters of these processes are estimated for 188 firms, using both the time series and cross-sectional (term structure) properties of the individual firms' bond prices. Although the estimated models are moderately successful at bond pricing, there is strong evidence of misspecification. The results indicate that single factor models of instantaneous default risk face a significant challenge in matching certain key features of actual corporate bond yield spreads. In particular, such models have difficulty generating both relatively flat yield spreads when firms have low credit risk and steeper yield spreads when firms have higher credit risk.

While the project's volatility and liquidation cost have little impact on the firm's total debt capacity, they increase the use of credit versus debt.
