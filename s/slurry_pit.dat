40|$|Pig {{production}} in Zambia {{is estimated to}} grow at 8 % per annum. This growth has resulted in increased amounts of manure that requires management consequently increasing methane emissions from the manure management systems used. Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Despite the increase in pig production there is inadequate research based information pertaining to methane emissions from pig manure management systems and how to reduce them. The study is aimed at estimating the reduction in methane emissions through changing manure management systems {{from the use of}} <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> to the use of anaerobic digesters on three piggeries in Zambia. This study will provide information to: policy makers, donors, development planners, livestock farmers and other stakeholders on the appropriate type of manure management system that should be introduced on livestock farms in Zambia in order to reduce manure methane emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology was used to estimate the methane emissions reduction on the three study farms. This method relies on two primary types of inputs that affect the calculation of methane emissions from manure: manure characteristics and type of manure management system. A reduction of 59. 2, 66 and 65. 9 % in methane emissions occurred on farms No. 1, 2 and 3 respectively, as result of changing manure management systems from <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> to anaerobic digesters. The results of the study demonstrate that the use of anaerobic digesters as manure management systems (MMSs) in place of <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> i...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying {{in-house}} {{emissions of}} methane (CH 4) from liquid manure (slurry) is difficult {{due to high}} background emissions from enteric processes, yet of great importance for correct estimation of CH 4 emissions from manure management and effects of treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion. In this study CH 4 production rates were determined in 20 pig slurry and 11 cattle slurry samples collected beneath slatted floors on six representative farms; rates were determined within 24 h at temperatures close to the temperature in <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> {{at the time of}} collection. Methane production rates in pig and cattle slurry differed significantly at 0. 030 and 0. 011 kg CH 4 kg- 1 VS (volatile solids). Current estimates of CH 4 emissions from pig and cattle manure management correspond to 0. 032 and 0. 015 kg CH 4 kg- 1, respectively, indicating that <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> under animal confinements are a significant source. Fractions of degradable volatile solids (VSd, kg kg- 1 VS) were estimated using an aerobic biodegradability assay and total organic C analyses. The VSd in pig and cattle slurry averaged 0. 51 and 0. 33 kg kg- 1 VS, and it was estimated that on average 43 and 28 % of VSd in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, respectively, had been lost at the time of sampling. An empirical model of CH 4 emissions from slurry was reparameterised based on experimental results. A sensitivity analysis indicated that predicted CH 4 emissions were highly sensitive to uncertainties in the value of lnA of the Arrhenius equation, but much less sensitive to uncertainties in VSd or slurry temperature. A model application indicated that losses of carbon in VS as CO 2 may be much greater than losses as CH 4. Implications of these results for the correct estimation of CH 4 emissions from manure management, and for the mitigation potential of treatments such as anaerobic digestion, are discussed...|$|R
25|$|However, simple {{husbandry}} {{changes and}} practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock {{during times of}} maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The Culicoides midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.|$|R
50|$|Slurry pits present {{risks of}} drowning, {{as well as}} of suffocation. Decomposition generates gases such as ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, and {{hydrogen}} sulphide. The latter two are heavier than air and will not disperse quickly from low places. Carbon dioxide is odorless; and hydrogen sulfide quickly becomes undetectable by odor by destroying victims' sense of smell. If inhaled, they can cause rapid unconsciousness by poisoning or displacement of oxygen leading to hypoxia. Death may follow then from poisoning or hypoxia directly, or by drowning caused by unconsciousness.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the emission, proper {{understanding}} of the transportation behaviour of gaseous ammonia inside the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> is required. Numerical simulation by the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique can be used for this purpose. However, direct modelling of slatted floors is complicated and may be replaced by the porous media model (PMM) as shown in earlier studies. The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the slatted floor (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of slurry in the pit) and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia emission from the pit. Three different CFD models of a slatted floor were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a slatted floor for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia emission from the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit,</b> and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a slatted floor model (SFM) which models the slatted floor as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the slatted floor by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit.</b> Results showed that the PMM (PMM-T and PMM-L) were able to predict both the airflow features inside the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> and the ammonia emission from the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> if the resistance parameters and flow regime of the porous media were properly set. In comparison to the SFM, the PMM-T predicted the flow pattern better, but overestimated the turbulence intensity and the consequent emission rate. PMM-L performed better in predicting the ammonia emission rate because of the relatively accurate prediction of turbulence intensity. Simulation results also showed that the ammonia emission rate increased with a higher mean airflow velocity, a smaller headspace height and the presence of sidewalls. </p...|$|E

During 59 half-nights (ca. 295 h) of observation and 17 nights (ca. 154 h) of camera surveillance, 139 separate visits to farm buildings, by at least 26 individually identifiable badgers from two social groups, were recorded. The badgers, which included three individuals infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), used cowsheds, feedsheds, barns, haystacks, <b>slurry</b> <b>pits,</b> cattle troughs and farmyards to exploit a range of food resources, including cattle feed and silage. Cattle feed was contaminated with badger faeces and badgers also came into close contact with cattle. The minimum number of badgers visiting farm buildings per night was negatively correlated with local 24 h rainfall.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the influence of airflow on ammonia emissions from pig house slurry in a model growing/finishing pig house with slurry in the pit and a clean slatted floor with various opening areas, 100 %, 33. 3 %, and 16. 7 %. The 100 % opening area meant that the headspace {{was an integral part}} of the room air space, and this configuration was used as the reference treatment. The pig house model had two sidewall inlets and exhaust in the middle of the ceiling. The liquid slurry used was from a growing/finishing pig building and consisted of 1 % to 2 % dry matter, had pH of 8. 05, and TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) of 2. 38 g/L. Experiments in a model growing/finishing swine barn were conducted to determine the effects of room ventilation rate, <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> air exchange rates, slatted floor openings, and pit headspace on ammonia emissions. The results showed that ammonia emission rate increased as ventilation rate increased with a constant inlet opening. Increase in the slatted floor opening ratio increased the air exchange rate in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit,</b> resulting in a higher ammonia emission rate. Different correlations between the ammonia emission rate and the air headspace height in the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> caused by the type of flow in the boundary layer influenced the ammonia transport from the slurry surface to the ventilation air. A statistical model was developed to calculate the ammonia emission rate as a function of ventilation rate, slatted floor opening ratio, and <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> headspace (R 2 = 0. 93). It was found that the NH 3 emission rate was more sensitive to the ventilation rate than to the slatted floor opening ratio and air headspace height in the pit. In addition, the NH 3 emission rate was much more sensitive to variations in the ventilation rate at low ventilation rates than at high ventilation rates. Similar sensitivity responses were obtained for both slatted floor opening ratio and air headspace height...|$|E

Yet, few studies have been conducted at farm scale. We studied the feasibility of three cover materials (peat, polystyrene balls and synthetic sheet roof) to reduce ammonia (NH 3) emissions during on-farm storage of pig slurry. The impact on greenhouse gasemissions, methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) of covering the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> was also evaluated. Simultaneous field experiments were carried out using two similar pits at a farm with peat and polystyrene ball covers, which allowed direct comparison of the feasibility ofthe two covers to reduce gas emissions (measured using the dynamic chamber technique). Emissions from the third option (using a synthetic sheet roof) were estimated by measuring the concentrations in the headspace under the cover and the air leakage from the cover with a tracer gas(CO 2). Results showed that the polystyrene balls cover reduced emissions of NH 3 during storage by up to 80 % whatever the season, but increased potential greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % in summer. No consistent reduction was achieved with the peat cover even though some individual results seemed to indicate up to 25 % reduction in ammonia emissions; moreover, there was a 30 %increase in CH 4 and CO 2 emissions during the storage period.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest among dairy farmers in The Netherlands for animal friendly housing systems {{that at the}} same moment reduce the ammonia emission compared to currently available systems. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a relatively cheap and easy measuring method to investigate the potential effect of new emission reduction systems. In 2008 and 2009 Wageningen UR Livestock Research preformed emission measurements on 3 different ammonia emission reduction systems using a dynamic flux chamber. All systems were meant for use in a free stall housing system for dairy cows. Two of the emission reduction systems were concrete floors and one was an emission reduction system covering the <b>slurry</b> in the <b>pits.</b> The experiments were conducted at three different practical dairy farms in the Netherlands, one for each system. Emission of the reduction system was related to emission of a references floor. In all cases a concrete slatted floor with <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> was used as a reference. Emission levels ranged from 39 % to 71 % of the emission of the reference system. The two systems based on reduction of floors emissions seemed to have more perspective than the system based on reduction of pit emissions.

Because of the case-control character of the flux chamber measurements the results can not be translated directly to full scale emission factors for dairy housing neither can they be used for between farms comparison...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of straw bedding, concrete floors, slats, and <b>slurry</b> in the <b>pits</b> to ammonia emission in a straw-bedded group-housing system for sows, the ammonia volatilisation response of urination on the potential emitting surfaces from a sow house was studied under laboratory conditions. Ammonia is mainly produced by hydrolysis of the urea in the urine: a process {{that depends on the}} characteristics of the surface of the emitting area. For the study, substrate samples were obtained from the surfaces of a concrete floor in the walking alley (A), <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> under the drinking area and the waiting area (D and W) and from the straw bedding (S 1, S 2, S 3). The latter represented straw with respectively a small (S 1), an average (S 2) and a high (S 3) content of slurry dropped by the sows. The controls were a sample of slurry from a reference conventional housing system with sows kept individually on partly slatted floors (R), and a sample of unsoiled fresh straw from the farm depot (S 0). After sprinkling 150 ml of urine on each sample, the ammonia volatilisation (E in mg), maximum volatilisation rate (rmax in mg/h) and time of occurrence of the maximum volatilisation rate (tmax in h) were measured during 7 days. Paired comparisons of the predicted means were based on standard error of differences (SEDs, probability P 0 · 05) and most from the slurry from the reference system (1686 mg, P 0 · 05). The highest volatilisation rate occurred from the concrete floor in the walking alley (17 · 5 mg/h, P> 0 · 05). The volatilisation rate peaked soonest with heavily soiled straw, <b>slurry</b> in the <b>pit</b> under the waiting and drinking area, concrete floor and slurry from the reference system, and latest from unsoiled straw (P> 0 · 05). The results reveal that in a sow house with straw bedding, the largest source of ammonia emission is a urine puddle on the concrete floor in the walking alley, and the smallest is a urination on straw, irrespective of the slurry content of the straw. Only at high slurry contents in the straw bedding does the rate at which ammonia is produced from urea increase. The implication is that straw bedding in a group-housing system for sows decreases the ammonia emission per m 2 after a urination; however, its effect on other gaseous emissions remains to be clarifie...|$|R
40|$|The present {{doctoral}} research {{describes the}} impact of diffuse and point sources on the pollution of the hydrosphere with nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the Goričko Landscape Park research area. The Goričko Landscape Park research area was divided into three parts: the River Basin of the Ledava, Velika Krka rivers, and the Kobilje Creek. In this manner, {{we were able to}} perform a comparative analysis inside the Landscape Park and in three sub-areas. In the scope of the methodological research we established that the comparison of the structure of use of the land among these three areas revealed certain differences. In the scope of the research we performed the monitoring of the liquid hydrosphere and researched the chemical status of the surface flowing water in the Goričko Landscape Park area. Within all three sub-areas significantly higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found in the water. The presence of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds is the result of unregulated <b>slurry</b> <b>pits</b> in livestock farming facilities, an unregulated sewerage infrastructure and the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the farming land. The forest is another significant source of nitrogen compounds. The calculated ratio Ntotal/Ptotal differs in different sampling points and ranges between 2 and 12. Using this method based on the balance approach we determined direct emissions from the livestock facilities into drains as the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. The results of the method for ecological characterization show the indirect impact of the terrain and slope on the hydrosphere.

Simulated ammonia emission levels were compared with measured levels for 1 day in each 3 -week period during two fattening periods of 15 weeks (one in winter and one in summer) in each of three fattening compartments. The overall mean ammonia emission measured was 6. 84 g d- 1 pig- 1, while the mean overall simulated emission was 6. 36 g d- 1 pig- 1, with 1. 96 g d- 1 pig- 1 simulated to volatilize {{from the floor and}} 4. 40 g d- 1 pig- 1 from the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit.</b> The mean relative difference between the daily simulated and measured ammonia emissions was 16. 9 %.

The grooves parallel to the alley had 160 mm center-to-center spacing and were 35 mm wide and 30 mm deep. The urine could drain along the grooves. Perforations in the grooves were spaced 1. 1 m apart and could be open or closed. When the perforations were open, urine could be drained directly into a <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> below.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to survey beef cattle manure in Iowa, analyze manure for P and other chemical properties, and determine the crop-availability of selected sources by soil testing. The survey samples (107) were classified into five categories according to animal and manure management: with bedding (BEDDED), open concrete floor (CONCRETE), dirt floor (DIRT), no feeding of corn (Zea mays L.) co-products (NoCCP), and <b>slurry</b> from deep <b>pits</b> (PIT). Manure total P (TP) and proportion of water-soluble P (MWSP) were higher for BEDDED, CONCRETE, and PIT [10, 11, 15 g TP kg- 1 - dry matter (DM) basis - and 59, 57, and 55 % of MWSP, respectively] than for DIRT and NoCCP. Representative samples from each group were selected for P fractionation analysis, and a P source-soil 23 -wk incubation study that also included di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and a control. All P sources were applied at 87 kg TP ha- 1. Soils were Adair (Aquertic Argiudolls), Harps (Typic Calciaquolls), and Nicollet (Aquic Hapludolls).

40|$|Foam {{accumulation}} on {{the manure}} <b>slurry</b> at deep <b>pit</b> swine facilities {{has been linked}} to flash fire incidents, making it a serious safety concern for pork producers. In order to investigate this phenomenon, samples of swine manure were collected from over 50 swine production facilities in Iowa with varying levels of foam accumulation over a seven month period. These samples were tested for a number of physical and chemical parameters including temperature, pH, total solids, volatile solids, volatile fatty acid concentration, biochemical methane potential, and methane production rate. After establishing these parameters, a foaming capacity and stability test was performed where samples were placed in clear PVC tubes with air diffusers at the bottom to simulate biogas production. The amount of foam produced at a set aeration rate was recorded as a measure of foaming capacity, and foam stability was assessed by measuring the height of foam remaining at certain time intervals after aeration had ceased. The results of this test indicated that samples collected from foaming barns showed a greater capacity to produce and stabilize foam. In addition, statistical analysis indicated that manures with foam produced methane at significantly greater rates than non-foaming manures (0. 154 ± 0. 010 and 0. 052 Â± 0. 003 L CH 4. /L slurry*day respectively, average standard error), and consequently had significantly greater fluxes of methane moving through the manure volume. On the other hand, the biochemical methane production assay suggested that manure from foaming pits had less potential to generate methane (112 ± 9 mL CH 4 /g VS) than non-foaming pits (129 Â± 9 mL CH 4 /g VS), and the VFA analysis showed significantly lower concentrations in foaming pits (4472, 3486, and 1439 Î¼g/g for the surface level and descending depths of the pit, respectively) as compared to non-foaming pits (9385, 8931, and 6938 Î¼g/g for the same sample depths). When taken together, these assays suggest enhanced anaerobic digestion efficiency from foaming barns, as well as the possible accumulation of a surfactant at the manure-air interface of foaming deep pits. Overall, this work supports a three-phase system conceptualization of foam production in swine manure deep pits, and that the control of {{one or more of these}} phases will be required for mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} {{can cause}} acidification and eutrophication of the environment, is an indirect source of nitrous oxide, {{and is a}} precursor of fine dust. The current mechanistic NH 3 emission base model for explaining and predicting NH 3 emissions from dairy cow houses with cubicles, a floor and <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> is based on measured data from {{a limited number of}} studies. It requires input values for numerous variables, but the empirical equations for the model parameters in the literature vary. Furthermore, many of the input variables cannot be assessed accurately, and their actual influence on the prediction is unknown. We aimed to improve NH 3 emission modelling, by assessing the contribution to the variation in NH 3 emission of each input variable and each model parameter related to a single urine puddle. We did so for 27 candidate models, created by each possible combination of three equations per model parameter: the acid dissociation constant, Henry’s law constant, and the mass transfer coefficient. After analysing each candidate model with a Global Sensitivity Analysis we found that at least 71 % of the model variation in NH 3 emission for each candidate model was explained by five puddle related input variables: pH, depth, area, initial urea concentration and temperature. NH 3 emission was not sensitive to the other four variables: air temperature, air velocity, maximum rate of urea conversion and the MichaeliseMenten constant for urea conversion. Based on these results we recommend simplifying the model structurally and reducing the number of input variables...|$|E
40|$|In {{dairy cattle}} systems, {{most of the}} feces and urine go to the pit. At the manure pit level, mass {{transfer}} of NH 3 (kNH(3)) has many factors, but practical difficulties hamper a controlled field evaluation. In this study, we propose a methodology for the determination of an alternative, more practical, pit transfer coefficient of NH 3 (PTC), and compare it with kNH(3) determined from other scientific studies. The aims of this research study were: (1) to develop a wind tunnel set-up which mimics air flow patterns between the slats and above a clean section of a slatted floor section, featuring an aqueous NH 3 -emitting solution; and (2) to assess how air velocity, turbulence intensity, NH 3 concentration ([NH 3]) and PTC are influenced by inlet airflow ventilation rate (VR) forced deflection of the air above the slats into the manure pit through varying the deflection angle (DA) of a deflection panel and varying pit headspace height (HH). Main conclusions were: (1) the calculated PTC values presented a good fit to the power function of the air speed near the slats (u) (p <. 001) while the average PTC (0. 0039 m s(- 1)) was comparable to kNH(3) values obtained from other studies, by remaining {{within the range of}} average values of 0. 0015 - 0. 0043 m s(- 1); (2) VR and DA significantly impacted [NH 3] profiles and PTC (p <. 001) and (3) changing <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> from 0. 10 to 0. 90 m HH did not significantly impact [NH 3] or PTC (p =. 756 and p =. 854, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Pig {{houses are}} {{important}} sources of ammonia (NH 3) emissions. For decades, investigations {{were carried out}} in determine the influencing factors and to point out opportunities of mitigation. In Europe, current NH 3 emissions associated to pig production are about 24 % lower than in 1990. However, further reduction seems necessary to avoid noxious effects on ecosystems. The main factors influencing NH 3 production are the floor type, the manure removal system, the climatic conditions inside the building, the diet composition and the feed efficiency of animals. In pig production, the main floor types are the slatted floor and the bedded floor systems. In both systems, numerous variants and adaptations can be found with consequently a range of emission levels for each housing condition. Therefore, decision in favour of a floor type as regards NH 3 emissions is difficult, especially as effective reducing strategies are available for both systems. For litter-based systems, the nature {{and the amount of}} substrate greatly influence the NH 3 production with usually lower emission in case of generous bedding. For slatted floor systems, most of the studies resulted in lower emissions with partly slatted floor on condition that the solid part of the floor remains clean. Indeed, hot conditions, high animal density or inadequate pen design can increase the soiling of the solid floor and lead to increased NH 3 emissions. In any case, emissions are lower if concrete slats are replaced by smooth materials like iron cast, metal or plastic slats. Several <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> designs and manure removal strategies were developed to mitigate emissions. The reduction of the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> surface thanks to sloped pit walls are related to proportional reductions of NH 3 emissions. Frequent manure removal, flushing and separating urine from faeces by V-shaped scraper or conveyor belts reduce the NH 3 releases from the buildings by about 50 %. However, the emissions during the storage period outside the building have {{to be taken into account}} for a whole assessment of the technique. Climate conditions inside the building also influence the emissions which are positively correlated with ambient temperature and ventilation rate. Consequently, ammonia emissions present seasonal and nychtemeral patterns. But, reducing the NH 3 production by modulation of the climate conditions is rather unpractical because the ambient parameters must primarily respect the bioclimatic requirements for animal comfort. A closer match between dietary intakes and requirement of the pigs according to the physiological and growth stage results in lower NH 3 emissions. In this way, diets with reduced crude protein content are highly effective in reducing the emissions with almost a 10 % reduction for every 10 g kg− 1 reduction in dietary crude protein. Other dietary strategies are also effective in lowering emissions. Dietary fibre inclusion reduces NH 3 emissions by about 40 % by shifting the nitrogen from urine to faeces due to promotion of bacterial growth in the large intestine. Lowering the dietary electrolyte balance or supplementation with acidifying salts like benzoic acid or CaSO 4 are related to significant reductions. Other feed additives like Yucca extract, zeolites, probiotics, humic substance or lactose were also validated by several experiments. Moreover, better feed efficiency obtained by genetic selection or modification of the hormonal status of the pigs is also related to reduced emissions. In conclusion, effective reduction of ammonia emissions from pig buildings can be reached operating both on housing conditions and feeding strategies. The former are very efficient but the assessment has to include the specificity of each system and involve the complete process. In some cases, investment and cost operating can hamper their development. Feeding strategies offer the advantage of being easy to implement and rapid to adapt function of particular circumstances.

40|$|Two methanotrophic bacteria, strains R- 45377 (T) and R- 45370, were {{respectively}} {{isolated from}} a <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> of a cow stable {{and from a}} denitrification tank of a wastewater treatment plant in Belgium. The strains showed 99. 9 /% 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Cells were Gram-negative, motile rods containing type I methanotroph intracytoplasmic membranes. Colonies and liquid cultures appeared white to pale pink. The pmoA gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and the nifH gene encoding nitrogenase were present. Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) activity, {{the presence of the}} mmoX gene encoding sMMO and the presence of the pxmA gene encoding a sequence-divergent pMMO were not detected. Methane and methanol were utilized as sole carbon sources. The strains grew optimally at 20 degrees C (range 15 - 28 degrees C) and at pH 6. 8 - 7. 3 (range pH 6. 3 - 7. 8). The strains grew in media supplemented with up to 1. 2 % NaCl. The major cellular fatty acids were C- 16 : 1 omega 8 c, C- 16 : 1 omega 5 c C- 16 : 1 omega 7 c, C- 14 : 0, C- 15 : 0 and C- 16 : 0 and the DNA G+C content was 47 mol%. 16 S rRNA geneand pmoA-based phylogenetic analyses showed that the isolates cluster among members of the genus Methylomonas within the class Gammaproteobacteria, with pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97. 5 and 97. 2 % between R- 45377 (T) and the closest related type strains, Methylomonas scandinavica SR 5 (T) and Methylomonas paludis MG 30 (T), respectively. Based on phenotypic characterization of strains R- 45377 (T) and R- 45370, their low 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarities and the formation of a separate phylogenetic lineage compared with existing species of the genus Methylomonas, we propose to classify these strains in a novel species, Methylomonas lenta sp. nov., with R- 45377 (T) (=LMG 26260 (T) =JCM 19378 (T)) as the type strain...|$|E
40|$|Five {{successive}} {{batches of}} fattening pigs were raised, each during a four month period, on a totally concrete slatted floor in one experimental room and on straw based deep litter in another. The rooms were automatically ventilated {{to maintain a}} constant ambient temperature. Available floor space was of 0. 75 in m(2) per pig kept on the slatted floor and 1. 20 m(2) per pig kept on the deep litter. With this last system, about 46 kg of straw were supplied per pig throughout a fattening period. The <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> was emptied and the litter removed after each batch. Once a month, the emissions of ammonia (NH 3) nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water vapour (H 2 O) were measured continuously for 6 consecutive days by infra-red. photoacoustic detection. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. Gaseous emissions from pigs raised on the slatted floor and on the deep litter were, respectively, 6. 2 and 13. 1 g per pig per day for NH 3, 0. 54 and 1. 11 g per pig per day for N 2 O, 16. 3 and 16. 0 g per pig per day for CH 4, 1. 74 and 1. 97 kg per pig per day for CO 2 and 2. 48 and 3. 70 kg per pig per day for H 2 O. Except for the CH 4 emissions, all the differences were significant (P< 0. 001). Thus, pig fattening on deep litter releases nearly 20 % more greenhouse gases than on slatted floor, with 2. 64 and 2. 24 kg of CO 2 equivalents, respectively (P< 0. 001). Whatever the floor type, emissions increased {{from the beginning to}} the end of the fattening periods by about 5 times for NH 3, 4 times for N 2 O, 3 times for CH 4 and 2 times for CO 2 and H 2 O. Correlation coefficients between CO 2 -emissions and H 2 O, NH 3 and CH 4 emissions were, on average for both floor types, 0. 82, 0. 77 and 0. 74, respectively. Although rearing pigs on straw generally has a good brand image for the consumer, this rearing system produces more pollutant gases than keeping pigs on slatted floors. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Gaseous {{emissions}} from agriculture {{contribute to a}} number of environmental effects. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are greenhouse gases taking part to the global problem of climate change. Ammonia (NH 3) emissions are responsible of soil acidification and eutrophication and contribute also to indirect emissions of N 2 O. This work evaluated the influence of the type of floor on the emissions of these gases in the raising of weaned pigs. Two trials were carried out. In the first trial, the animals were kept either on fully slatted floor or on straw-based deep litter and, in the second one, either on fully slatted floor or on sawdust-based deep litter. For each trial and on each type of floor, 2 successive batches of weaned pigs were raised without changing the litter or emptying the <b>slurry</b> <b>pit</b> between the 2 batches. The rooms were automatically ventilated to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. In trial 1, the nitrogen contents of the straw deep litter (including the substrate) and slurry were respectively 276 and 389 g pig- 1. In trial 2, the sawdust deep litter and slurry nitrogen contents were respectively 122 and 318 g pig- 1. Raising pigs on straw deep litter produced proportionately around 100 % more NH 3 than raising pigs on slatted floor (0. 61 vs. 0. 31 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 05). Differences in CO 2, H 2 O and CH 4 emissions were not significant between systems. Raising pigs on sawdust deep litter produced also proportionately more NH 3 (+ 52 %; 0. 55 vs. 0. 36 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 01) but also more CO 2 (+ 25 %; 427 vs. 341 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and H 2 O (+ 65 %; 981 vs. 593 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and less CH 4 (- 40 %; 0. 52 vs. 0. 86 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) than raising pigs on slatted floor. Practically no N 2 O emission was observed from rooms with slatted floor while the N 2 O emissions were 0. 03 and 0. 32 g N 2 O-N d- 1 per pig for the straw and sawdust deep litter respectively. The warming potential of the greenhouse gases (N 2 O + CH 4), were about 22, 34 and 168 g CO 2 equivalents per day and per pig on fully slatted floor, straw or sawdust deep litter respectively.
