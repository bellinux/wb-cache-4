5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> client by mail. The development of modems and internet {{technology in the}} 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E

But he again struggled once the regular season began, and on October 17 was <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hartford Wolf Pack, along with J. T. Miller. Fast had nine points (one goal, eight assists) over the next 11 matches for Hartford, including two 2-assist games on October 24, and November 8, notching his sole goal in a 4–3 win over the Worcester Sharks on November 2. He was recalled by the Rangers on November 10.|$|E
