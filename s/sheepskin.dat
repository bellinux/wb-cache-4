5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} <b>sheepskin</b> boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a {{well-known}} brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced <b>sheepskin</b> with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sheepskin</b> is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
25|$|Being {{one of many}} {{clothing}} {{products made}} from animal skin, the production of <b>sheepskin</b> boots {{has been the subject}} of criticism by the animal rights movement with producers responding by improving animal welfare. Animal rights groups call for the boycott of <b>sheepskin</b> boots and their replacement with synthetic alternatives. In 2007, Pamela Anderson, realizing that the boots were made of skin, called for a boycott on her website. In February 2008, the Princeton Animal Welfare Society staged a campus protest against the fur industry, particularly attacking the <b>sheepskin</b> boot industry.|$|E

25|$|The first {{trademark}} {{application for}} UGG in the United States was filed by Brian Smith’s company in 1984.

In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out {{cease and desist}} letters to Australian manufacturers that were selling <b>sheepskin</b> boots outside of Australia via the internet. By the early 2000s, demand for UGG boots was soaring with Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers selling <b>sheepskin</b> boots over the Internet. There was confusion among consumers between generic ugg boots made in Australia and Deckers' UGG brand boots. Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt the Australian companies' sales by sending cease and desist letters {{to a number of}} Australian and U.S. based manufacturers, preventing them from selling <b>sheepskin</b> boots using the UGG trademark on eBay or from using the word in their registered business names or domain names. Deckers initiated numerous domain name actions under the UDRP.|$|E

When New Patagonia paid off the loan in 1913, and wished to start selling its <b>sheepskins</b> to other firms, Kreglinger claimed the right to an injunction. New Patagonia argued that the exclusivity provision was a clog on the equity of redemption and should be consequently held void.|$|R
