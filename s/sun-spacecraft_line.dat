40|$|In this paper, we use coronal and heliospheric {{images from}} the STEREO {{spacecraft}} to track streamer blobs into the heliosphere and to observe them being swept up and compressed by the fast wind from low-latitude coronal holes. From an analysis of their elongation/time tracks, we discover a ‘locus of enhanced visibility ’ where neighboring blobs pass each other {{along the line of}} sight and their corotating spiral is seen edge on. The detailed shape of this locus accounts for a variety of east-west asymmetries and allows us to recognize the spiral of blobs by its signatures in the STEREO images: In the eastern view from STEREO-A, {{the leading edge of the}} spiral is visible as a moving wavefront where foreground ejections overtake background ejections against the sky and then fade. In the western view from STEREO-B, the leading edge is only visible close to the <b>Sun-spacecraft</b> <b>line</b> where the radial path of ejections nearly coincides with the line of sight. In this case, we can track large-scale waves continuously back to the lower corona and see that they originate as face-on blobs...|$|E
40|$|The low Earth orbit (LEO) Pico Satellite Solar Cell Testbed {{spacecraft}} (PSSCT; {{also known}} as the PSSC Testbed) was ejected from the Space Shuttle Endeavour at 12 : 34 PM, PST, on November 29, 2008. The LEO PSSCT is a 6. 5 -kg mass, 5 ” x 5 ” x 10 ”, fairly rigid, box-shaped nanosatellite designed to provide space flight data on radiation degradation of multi-junction solar cells. The LEO PSSCT was ejected from the shuttle with the long axis (Z axis) perpendicular to the instantaneous <b>sun-spacecraft</b> <b>line.</b> It has an internal momentum wheel that was spun up before ejection, thus determining the angular momentum vector in inertial space. After ejection, the momentum wheel took 5 minutes to slow down, thus imparting a 507 degree/second rotation rate for the spacecraft body about the Z axis. MEMS rate gyros from Analog Devices were used to monitor the rotation rates about the X, Y, and Z axes, with Earth and sun sensors providing additional information for on-orbit spin rate calibration. The Z axis has the minimum moment-of-inertia, so we expected the spacecraft to transfer energy from the Z axis to the X and Y axes {{over the course of several}} months. We obtained over three months of on-orbit spin rate data...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{previous}} works, this paper introduces a novel continuous-time stochastic optimal linear quaternion estimator under {{the assumptions of}} rate gyro measurements and of vector observations of the attitude. A quaternion observation model, which observa-tion matrix is rank degenerate, is reduced to a two-dimensional model via a maximum information rate approach. The resulted filter combines the exact treatment of the quater-nion process state-dependent noise and the quaternion measurement state-dependent noise under the framework of continuous-time optimal linear filtering. This yields statistically consistent covariance computations within the proposed filter without requiring tuning. The case of white noises in the gyro and vector measurements are considered in this work. This paper also presents {{the development of a}} Sun vector determination subsystem for the nanosatelite Delfi-N 3 xt. Simulations and preliminary experimental validation show that this subsystem, which consists of six four-quadrant Sun sensors, can deliver a <b>Sun-spacecraft</b> <b>line</b> of sight with an averaged equivalent angular error of approximately 0. 2 deg without the Earth albedo. The performances of the novel filter are illustrated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations in the case of Delfi-N 3 xt, where Sun vector measurements, Earth magnetic measurements and gyro measurements are acquired along a 600 km height Sun synchronous orbit. The proposed filter appears to be insensitive to poor initial conditions and low sampling rates. It converges where a standard extended Kalman filter fails to do so under the same conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{electric}} sail 1, 2 {{is a new}} propulsion {{concept that}} uses the solar wind momentum flux for producing thrust. Like the more conventional solar sail, it allows a spacecraft to perform high-energy orbit transfers without a need for reaction mass. The electric sail could accelerate small (10 - 100 kg) payloads to substantial final speeds, larger than that are possible with conventional (either chemical or electric) propulsion systems. It could also provide a lightweight propulsion alternative for larger payloads (100 - 1000 kg). With reference to the latter choice, {{in this paper we}} provide quantitative estimates for optimized Earth-Mars transfers for both an electric sail and a solar electric propulsion (SEP) system. To facilitate the comparison we use the same specific power assumption for both systems. For this case study it is found that the electric sail and SEP performance are rather similar. The electric sail has higher payload fraction than SEP, whereas SEP tends to have somewhat shorter mission times.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, a {{technique}} {{has been developed}} whereby the radial velocity, V[subscript: r], and longitude direction, β, of propagation of an outward-moving solar transient, such as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), can be estimated from its track in a time-elongation map produced using Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations from a single STEREO spacecraft. The method employed, which takes advantage of an artefact of projective geometry, {{is based on the}} evaluation of the best fit of the time-elongation profile of the transient, extracted from a time-elongation map, to a set of theoretical functions corresponding to known combinations of radial velocity and direction; here we present an initial theoretical assessment of the efficacy of this technique. As the method relies on the manual selection of points along the time-elongation profile, an assessment of the accuracy with which this is feasible, is initially made. The work then presented assesses theoretically this method of recovering the velocity and propagation direction of solar transients from their time-elongation profiles using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach. In particular, we assess the range of elongations over which it is necessary to make observations in order to accurately recover these parameters. Results of the Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that it is sufficient to track a solar transient out to around 40 ° elongation to provide accurate estimates of its associated radial velocity and direction; the accuracy to which these parameters can be estimated for a transient tracked over a particular elongation extent is, however, sensitive to its velocity and direction relative to the <b>Sun-Spacecraft</b> <b>line.</b> These initial results suggest that this technique based on single spacecraft STEREO/HI observations could prove extremely useful in terms of providing an early warning of a CME impact on the near-Earth environment.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO, it is {{possible}} to derive the direction of propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in addition to their speed with a variety of methods. For CMEs observed by both STEREO spacecraft, {{it is possible to}} derive their direction using simultaneous observations from the twin spacecraft and also, using observations from only one spacecraft with fitting methods. This makes it possible to test and compare different analyses techniques. In this article, we propose a new fitting method based on observations from one spacecraft, which we compare to the commonly used fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999). We also compare the results from these two fitting methods with those from two stereoscopic methods, focusing on 12 CMEs observed simultaneously by the two STEREO spacecraft in 2008 and 2009. We find evidence that the fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999) can result in significant errors in the determination of the CME direction when the CME propagates outside of 60 deg ± 20 deg from the <b>Sun-spacecraft</b> <b>line.</b> We expect our new fitting method to be better adapted to the analysis of halo or limb CMEs with respect to the observing spacecraft. We also find some evidence that direct triangulation in the HI fields-of-view should only be applied to CMEs propagating approximatively towards Earth (± 20 deg from the Sun-Earth line). Last, we address one of the possible sources of errors of fitting methods: the assumption of radial propagation. Using stereoscopic methods, we find that at least seven of the 12 studied CMEs had an heliospheric deflection of less than 20 deg as they propagated in the HI fields-of-view, which, we believe, validates this approximation.

40|$|The Fixed-Φ (FΦ) and Harmonic Mean (HM) fitting {{methods are}} two methods to {{determine}} the average direction and velocity of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from time-elongation tracks produced by Heliospheric Imagers (HIs), such as the HIs onboard the STEREO spacecraft. Both methods assume a constant velocity in their descriptions of the time-elongation profiles of CMEs, which are used to fit the observed time-elongation data. Here, we analyze the effect of aerodynamic drag on CMEs propagating through interplanetary space, and how this drag affects {{the result of the}} FΦ and HM fitting methods. A simple drag model is used to analytically construct time-elongation profiles which are then fitted with the two methods. It is found that higher angles and velocities give rise to greater error in both methods, reaching errors in the direction of propagation of up to 15 deg and 30 deg for the FΦ and HM fitting methods, respectively. This is due to the physical accelerations of the CMEs being interpreted as geometrical accelerations by the fitting methods. Because of the geometrical definition of the HM fitting method, it is affected by the acceleration more greatly than the FΦ fitting method. Overall, we find that both techniques overestimate the initial (and final) velocity and direction for fast CMEs propagating beyond 90 deg from the <b>Sun-spacecraft</b> <b>line,</b> meaning that arrival times at 1 AU would be predicted early (by up to 12 hours). We also find that the direction and arrival time of a wide and decelerating CME can be better reproduced by the FΦ due to the cancellation of two errors: neglecting the CME width and neglecting the CME deceleration. Overall, the inaccuracies of the two fitting methods are expected {{to play an important role}} in the prediction of CME hit and arrival times as we head towards solar maximum and the STEREO spacecraft further move behind the Sun.
