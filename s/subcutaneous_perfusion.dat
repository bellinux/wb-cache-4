40|$|AbstractIrisin is a cleaved and {{secreted}} {{fragment of}} fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC 5), {{and contributes to}} the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. Here we report the therapeutical effects of FNDC 5 /irisin on metabolic derangements and insulin resistance in obesity, and show the lipolysis effect of irisin and its signal molecular mechanism. In obese mice, lentivirus mediated-FNDC 5 overexpression enhanced energy expenditure, lipolysis and insulin sensitivity, and reduced hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinism, blood pressure and norepinephrine levels; it increased hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) expression and phosphorylation, and reduced perilipin level and adipocyte diameter in adipose tissues. <b>Subcutaneous</b> <b>perfusion</b> of irisin reduced hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia, and improved insulin resistance. Either FNDC 5 overexpression or irisin perfusion only induced a tendency toward a slight decrease in body weight in obese mice. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, irisin enhanced basal lipolysis rather than isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were prevented by inhibition of adenylate cyclase or PKA; irisin increased the HSL and perilipin phosphorylation; it increased PKA activity, and cAMP and HSL mRNA levels, but reduced perilipin expression. These results indicate that FNDC 5 /irisin ameliorates glucose/lipid metabolic derangements and insulin resistance in obese mice, and enhances lipolysis via cAMP–PKA–HSL/perilipin pathway. FNDC 5 or irisin can be taken as an effective therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Laser speckle imaging (LSI) has {{developed}} into a versatile tool to image dynamical processes in turbid media, such as <b>subcutaneous</b> blood <b>perfusion</b> and heterogeneous dynamics in soft materials. Spatially resolved information about local dynamics is obtained by measuring time-dependent correlation functions of multiply scattered light. Due to the diffusive nature of photons in highly scattering media, the measured signal is a convolution of the local dynamics in the material and the spatial distribution of photons. This spatial averaging inevitably leads {{to a loss of}} resolution, which {{must be taken into account}} for a correct interpretation of LSI measurements. In this paper we derive analytical expressions to quantify the effects of spatial blurring in backscatter LSI for materials with heterogeneous dynamics. Using the diffusion approximation, we calculate the photon density distribution for a semi-infinite material, and we predict the effect of dynamic heterogeneity on the measured correlation function. We verify our theoretical expressions using random walk simulations. Our results show that LSI measurements in dynamically heterogeneous materials should be interpreted with caution, especially when only a single wavelength and correlation time are used to obtain the dynamical map...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{near-infrared}} fluorescence (DNIF) whole-body imaging {{of small}} animals {{has become a}} popular tool in experimental biomedical research. In humans, however, {{the field of view}} has been limited to body parts, such as rheumatoid hands, diabetic feet or sentinel lymph nodes. Here we present a new whole-body DNIF-system suitable for adult subjects. We explored whether this system (i) allows dynamic whole-body fluorescence imaging and (ii) can detect modulations in skin perfusion. The non-specific fluorescent probe indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously into two subjects, and fluorescence images were obtained at 5 Hz. The in- and out-flow kinetics of ICG have been shown to correlate with tissue perfusion. To validate the system, skin perfusion was modulated by warming and cooling distinct areas on the chest and the abdomen. Movies of fluorescence images show a bolus passage first in the face, then in the chest, abdomen and finally in the periphery (, 10, 15, 20 and 30 seconds, respectively). When skin perfusion is augmented by warming, bolus arrives about 5 seconds earlier than when the skin is cooled and perfusion decreased. Calculating bolus arrival times and spatial fitting of basis time courses extracted from different regions of interest allowed a mapping of local differences in <b>subcutaneous</b> skin <b>perfusion.</b> This experiment is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of whole-body dynamic fluorescence imaging in humans. Since the whole-body approach demonstrates sensitivity to circumscribed alterations in skinperfusion, it may be used to target autonomous changes in polyneuropathy and to screen for peripheral vascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between in the increase in <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue <b>perfusion</b> rate (TPR) upon inhalation of radon water and the vasoactive effects of radon, rabbits inhaled nebulized water containing 14, 000 - 18, 000 Bq/ 1 radon (radon group) taken from Ikeda Mineral Spring, Shimane Pref., Japan. Control rabbits inhaled radon water from the same springs which had been kept for over 10 radon half-life periods. TPR was evaluated 15 minutes after the beginning of inhalation by mass spectrometry. After inhalation for 90 minutes, plasma and adrenal glands were removed, and levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (THI mithod). Each group was divided into 4 subgroups according to intravenously injected medication as follows : 1) no medication (without adrenergic blocker), 2) phentolamine (α-blocker), 0. 05 mg/kg/min, 3) propranolol (non-selective β-blocker), 1 mg/kg, and 4) atenolol (selective β 1 -blocker), 6 mg/kg. In the radon group, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 05), and adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were significantly lower (p< 0. 01, P< 0. 01), {{than those in the}} control group. In the no medication and phentolamine subgroups, TPRs in the radon group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p< 0. 01, P< 0. 01). In the propranolol and atenolol subgroups, no significant change of TPR was found. It is suggested that catecholamines are secreted from the adrenal glands upon inhalation of radon water and that the β 1 -action of catecholamines contributes to the increase in tissue perfusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Investigation of bioheat {{transfer}} problems {{requires the}} evaluation of temporal and spatial distributions of temperature. This class of problems has been traditionally addressed using the Pennes bioheat equation. Transport of heat by conduction, and by temperature-dependent, spatially heterogeneous blood perfusion is modeled here using a transport lattice approach. Methods We represent heat transport processes by using a lattice that represents the Pennes bioheat equation in perfused tissues, and diffusion in nonperfused regions. The three layer skin model has a nonperfused viable epidermis, and deeper regions of dermis and <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue with <b>perfusion</b> that is constant or temperature-dependent. Two cases are considered: (1) surface contact heating and (2) spatially distributed heating. The model is relevant {{to the prediction of}} the transient and steady state temperature rise for different methods of power deposition within the skin. Accumulated thermal damage is estimated by using an Arrhenius type rate equation at locations where viable tissue temperature exceeds 42 °C. Prediction of spatial temperature distributions is also illustrated with a two-dimensional model of skin created from a histological image. Results The transport lattice approach was validated by comparison with an analytical solution for a slab with homogeneous thermal properties and spatially distributed uniform sink held at constant temperatures at the ends. For typical transcutaneous blood gas sensing conditions the estimated damage is small, even with prolonged skin contact to a 45 °C surface. Spatial heterogeneity in skin thermal properties leads to a non-uniform temperature distribution during a 10 GHz electromagnetic field exposure. A realistic two-dimensional model of the skin shows that tissue heterogeneity does not lead to a significant local temperature increase when heated by a hot wire tip. Conclusions The heat transport system model of the skin was solved by exploiting the mathematical analogy between local thermal models and local electrical (charge transport) models, thereby allowing robust, circuit simulation software to obtain solutions to Kirchhoff's laws for the system model. Transport lattices allow systematic introduction of realistic geometry and spatially heterogeneous heat transport mechanisms. Local representations for both simple, passive functions and more complex local models can be easily and intuitively included into the system model of a tissue. </p...|$|R
