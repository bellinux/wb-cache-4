5|$|Le Secret de La Licorne began <b>serialisation</b> as a daily {{strip in}} {{newspaper}} Le Soir from 11 June 1942. As with previous adventures, it then began <b>serialisation</b> in the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants, from 19 March 1944. In Belgium, {{it was then}} published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1943. Now fully coloured, the book included a new cover design created by Hergé after he had completed the original <b>serialisation</b> of the story, along with six large colour drawings. The first printing sold 30,000 copies in Francophone Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 {{the fort}} was used {{extensively}} for {{the filming of}} Edward & Mrs. Simpson, an ITV <b>serialisation</b> of Edward and Wallis's relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes {{were well}} {{received}} upon their <b>serialisation</b> in The Strand Magazine.|$|E
50|$|These {{forms are}} {{a set of}} {{optionally}} inflected verbs which occur in <b>serialisations</b> functioning as case markers. As they may potentially contain inflection for third person singular in these <b>serialisations</b> they depart from the typical uninflected preposition. However, they retain the prepositional function of relating a dependent noun phrase to a verbal head.|$|R
5|$|From 1966 to 1979, Children's Digest {{included}} monthly instalments of The Adventures of Tintin. These <b>serialisations</b> {{served to}} increase Tintin's popularity, introducing him to {{many thousands of}} new readers in the United States.|$|R
50|$|He {{retired in}} 1983 as {{executive}} editor but continued in an advisory capacity at You magazine, as literary {{editor for the}} Mail as well as working on book <b>serialisations</b> almost {{until the end of}} his life.|$|R
5|$|You Only Live Twice {{was adapted}} for <b>serialisation</b> in the Daily Express {{newspaper}} {{on a daily}} basis from 2 March 1964 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{portrayal}} of Germans as the antagonists of the story, {{it would not}} have been appropriate for Land of Black Gold to continue <b>serialisation</b> under Nazi occupation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for <b>serialisation</b> in their newspaper; as he was unable to think of a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The <b>serialisation</b> ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|Bussi {{publishes a}} book a year, {{but they can}} take several years to become popular. For example, Mourir sur Seine (2008) and Nymphéas Noirs (2011) had only modest initial success, but {{paperwork}} editions, <b>serialisations</b> and above all his master work Un avion Sans Elle have propelled him into the limelight.|$|R
50|$|The Magical Music Box, more {{commonly}} known as The Music Box was a British children's magazine. It ran from 1993 to 1997 {{in a series of}} 52 monthly <b>serialisations.</b> The aim of the magazine was to introduce children into classical music and to popularise this form of music among the younger generations.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as the}} two <b>serialisations,</b> {{the story}} has been {{published}} as a novel on seven occasions. The first, produced by Richard Bentley, the owner of Bentley's Miscellany, appeared in July 1841, as a 3-volume set illustrated by George Cruikshank. Two American editions and a French edition {{were published in the}} same year. Routledge published three further editions, in 1842, 1857, and 1878.|$|R
5|$|Les Aventures de Totor, C.P. des hannetons began <b>serialisation</b> in Le Boy-Scout Belge in July 1926, {{and would}} {{continue}} {{to appear in the}} magazine until July 1929.|$|E
5|$|The Calculus Affair began <b>serialisation</b> in Tintin magazine's Christmas edition on 22 December 1954, and {{continued}} {{to appear in the}} pages of that publication until 22 February 1956. It would be the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be serialised without interruption since Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). <b>Serialisation</b> began in the French edition of Tintin in February 1955. It was subsequently published in single form as L'Affaire Tournesol by Casterman in 1956. For this volume Hergé had designed a front cover; initially, it simply showed Tintin and Haddock hiding Calculus from Bordurian soldiers, but he subsequently added shattered yellow glass {{around the edges of the}} image for dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{comic strip}} began <b>serialisation</b> in Le Petit Vingtième on 9 August 1934 as Les Aventures De Tintin Reporter En Extrême-Orient (The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East). It began <b>serialisation</b> in France in Cœurs Vaillants from 29 December 1935, {{and later in}} the Swiss {{magazine}} L'Écho Illustré. Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story. He also alluded to the movie that Tintin had witnessed being filmed in Cigar, Rastapopoulos' The Sheik's House, having characters enter a cinema where it was being screened.|$|E
50|$|N-Triples was {{designed}} to be a simpler format than Notation 3 and Turtle, and therefore easier for software to parse and generate. However, because it lacks some of the shortcuts provided by other RDF <b>serialisations</b> (such as CURIEs and nested resources, which are provided by both RDF/XML and Turtle) it can be onerous to type out large amounts of data by hand, and difficult to read.|$|R
50|$|His {{first four}} novels were science fiction or {{variants}} thereon. As from the Memory Cathedral (1995), further novels have been alternate history and/or magical realism. In keeping with a practice not uncommon among science fiction writers, his bibliography shows {{several of his}} novels having been preceded by the publication of shorter works of varying length, which are progenitors, partial <b>serialisations</b> or extracts from his eventual full length published books.|$|R
50|$|Hazlewood {{wrote mainly}} for the Britannia and Pavilion Theatres, and {{is said to}} have been paid at the rate of about fifty shillings an act, with {{something}} extra for a very successful piece. He was the most prolific contributor of plays to the Britannia and his sources ranged from recently published novels and <b>serialisations</b> in such journals as The Family, The Herald and Bow Bells to juvenile literature, popular paintings and newspaper reports.|$|R
5|$|The story began <b>serialisation</b> in the Belgium's Tintin {{magazine}} from 30 March 1950, in the French language. It {{then began}} <b>serialisation</b> {{over the border}} in France, in that country's edition of the magazine, from 11 May 1950. During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode. The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began <b>serialisation</b> in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the <b>serialisation</b> of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about to be caught in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E
5|$|The story began <b>serialisation</b> in Belgium's Tintin {{magazine}} in October 1956, before being serialised in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from December 1956. It was then published in book form by Casterman in 1958. Upon the story's British publication in 1960, Coke en Stock was renamed The Red Sea Sharks.|$|E
50|$|Cornhill {{was founded}} by George Murray Smith in 1859, the first issue {{carrying}} the cover date of January 1860. It continued until 1975. It was a literary journal with a selection of articles on diverse subjects and <b>serialisations</b> of new novels. Smith hoped to gain {{some of the same}} readership enjoyed by All the Year Round, a similar magazine owned by Charles Dickens, and he employed as editor William Thackeray, Dickens' great literary rival at the time.|$|R
25|$|From the 1970s, Guinness made regular {{appearances}} on UK television, including {{the part of}} George Smiley in the <b>serialisations</b> of two novels by John le Carré: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People. He twice won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for the roles, and Le Carré was so impressed by Guinness's performance as Smiley that he based his characterisation of Smiley in subsequent novels on Guinness. One of Guinness's last appearances was in the BBC drama Eskimo Day (1996).|$|R
50|$|A hybrid variety/comedy/quiz/people-show h&p@bbc (1999) was a flop. Similarly, their dramatisation of the Dalziel and Pascoe detectives for ITV in 1994 did {{not lead}} to success, and the BBC later {{attempted}} the <b>serialisations</b> with more success, with Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan in the title roles. They appeared working in a shoe shop in episode two of The Armando Iannucci Shows (2001). More recently they appeared in the Christmas Special of the Gervais and Merchant show Extras, broadcast in December 2007.|$|R
5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by the publishers, it was not serialised in a popular magazine, as originally intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of <b>serialisation</b> that had become unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Hergé {{changed his}} mind about moving to Argentina for reasons that remain unknown. <b>Serialisation</b> of Prisoners of the Sun culminated on 22 April 1948. As with {{previous}} adventures, the title had also been serialised in the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants, from 30 November 1947.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began <b>serialisation</b> in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E
50|$|From the 1970s, Guinness made regular {{television}} {{appearances in}} Britain, including {{the part of}} George Smiley in the <b>serialisations</b> of two novels by John le Carré: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People. He twice won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for the roles, and Le Carré was so impressed by Guinness's performance as Smiley that he based his characterisation of Smiley in subsequent novels on Guinness. One of Guinness's last appearances was in the BBC drama Eskimo Day (1996).|$|R
50|$|His {{professional}} and personal correspondence, diaries, magazine and journal essays, press cuttings, book <b>serialisations,</b> reviews of his works, the background notes, drafts and proofs of his writings, and material relating to his unpublished writings—have been preserved. During the 1960s, two major American universities pressed Moorehead to deposit his private papers as a core of their collections of contemporary writers. Instead, in 1971, Alan and Lucy Moorehead brought his papers to Australia to present them in person to the National Library.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{originally}} screened on the BBC1 Sunday afternoon slot, which often showed <b>serialisations</b> of classics {{aimed at a}} family audience. It made some free adaptations to Hughes's novel, creating the role of Flashman's father, and writing new sub-plots about Flashman and Arnold. [...] It also included some scenes of bullying and corporal punishment {{which may have been}} strong stuff for family viewing. [...] "Clean-up TV" [...] campaigner Mary Whitehouse claimed that the programme broke the BBC's guidelines on the depiction of sadistic violence.|$|R
5|$|The Punch <b>serialisation</b> {{ended in}} May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters {{and their friends}} celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's {{appointment}} as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.|$|E
5|$|The story began <b>serialisation</b> in Tintin {{magazine}} from 16 September 1948, {{before beginning}} its <b>serialisation</b> in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from 28 October 1948. Rather than continuing {{at the point where}} he had previously left off, Hergé started the story from scratch. He nevertheless made revisions to {{the early part of the}} story, namely by reworking the characters of Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus, as well as the location of Marlinspike Hall, into the narrative, all of which were elements that had been introduced to the Adventures of Tintin during the intervening eight years. Hergé was contractually obliged to produce two pages of comic for each issue, and in the previous adventure, Prisoners of the Sun, had fulfilled this by producing two pages of new Tintin stories each week. Seeking to limit his workload, he would only produce one page of Land of Black Gold per issue, with the other page being filled by a re-serialisation of old stories from his Jo, Zette and Jocko series.|$|E
5|$|After being {{published}} in Belgium, the story began <b>serialisation</b> in neighbouring France; initially {{appearing in the}} magazine Cœurs Vaillants-Âmes Vaillants from 4 August 1940, the story was ultimately interrupted, and would only recommence in June 1945, {{this time in the}} magazine Message Aux Cœurs Vaillants. From December 1945 to May 1946 it then appeared in a youth supplement to the newspaper La Voix de l'Ouest under the title of Tintin et Milou au pays de l'or liquide ("Tintin and Snowy in the Land of Liquid Gold").|$|E
2500|$|When Cha was {{transferred}} to Hsin Wan Pao (of British Hong Kong) as Deputy Editor, he met Chen Wentong, who wrote his first wuxia novel under the pseudonym [...] "Liang Yusheng" [...] in 1953. Chen and Cha became good friends and it was under the former's influence that Cha began work on his first serialised martial arts novel, The Book and the Sword, in 1955. In 1957, while still working on wuxia <b>serialisations,</b> he quit his previous job {{and worked as a}} scenarist-director and scriptwriter at Great Wall Movie Enterprises Ltd and Phoenix Film Company.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, the [...] "Illustrated Family Paper" [...] started publication, {{aiming to}} provide {{literary}} recreation {{for a family}} audience. It included not just educational articles but <b>serialisations</b> of novels as well. One of these [...] "The Warp and the Weft", a tale about Lancashire mill workers by John Frederick Smith, appeared during the Lancashire Cotton Famine, and inspired readers of the paper to contribute a large sum to a relief fund for cotton workers. In 1867, after Cassell's death, the magazine was reduced in size and {{changed its name to}} Cassell's Magazine.|$|R
5000|$|The Labour MP Alex Lyon waved {{a copy of}} The Sun in the House of Commons and {{suggested}} the paper could be prosecuted for indecency. Sexually related features such as [...] "Do Men Still Want To Marry A Virgin?" [...] and [...] "The Way into a Woman's Bed" [...] began to appear. <b>Serialisations</b> of erotic books were frequent; the publication of extracts from The Sensuous Woman, {{at a time when}} copies of the book were being seized by Customs, produced a scandal and a significant amount of free publicity.|$|R
