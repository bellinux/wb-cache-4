However, BTL fuels have a greater potential to secure and diversify the energy supply for transport in an environmentally compliant way than conventional biofuel. Compared to conventional biofuels, BTL fuels have a larger production potential, owing to higher biofuel yield per hectare and larger land area for growing feedstock, resulting in lower production costs as well. BTL fuels have also the best environmental performance amongst all transport fuels. The breakdown of BTL fractions better corresponds to the trends in fuel consumption than the fraction breakdown of oil refining. The rising oil prices reduced already significantly the cost gap between BTL and oil-derived fuels, if any gap at all. BTL production contributes to the security and diversity of the EU energy supply also by replacing the laternative gas-to-liduid (GTL) production from natural gas.

40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} of the alternative liquid fuel sources to enter into the liquid fuel market is analyzed based on the cost structures of these sources. Firstly, the current unconventional sources are classified as syncrude, <b>synthetic</b> fuels and <b>biofuels</b> and some basic information including production methods and current production amounts about these alternative sources is explained. Secondly, the production costs are examined to calculate the market entrance prices and shut-down prices for the technologies used to produce liquid fuels from the unconventional sources. Lastly, the structure of the liquid fuel market and {{the potential}} of alternative fuels in the market are discussed. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that the liquid fuel market can be characterized as a competitive market in which three factors play important role on determining the entrance into the market. These factors are (1) the corresponding oil prices for entrance and shut-down prices, (2) total capital cost of the project (the level of sunk cost), and (3) the capital cost per daily barrel of capacity. The evaluation of these factors together shows that biofuels are the most preferable option followed by gas-to-liquids. In terms of market entrance price, syncrude is the most advantageous option, but its high capital cost increases the risk. On the other hand, coal-to-liquids is the most risky one with high market entrance price, large initial capital cost and high margin between entrance and shut-down prices.

40|$|The present work, where {{additional}} value-creating {{processes in}} existing {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) structures have been examined, {{is motivated by}} a political- and consumer-driven strive towards a bioeconomy and a stagnation for the existing business models in large parts of the CHP sector. The research is based on cases where the integration of flash pyrolysis for co-production of bio-oil, co-gasification for production of fuel gas and <b>synthetic</b> <b>biofuels</b> as well as leaching of extractable fuel components in existing CHP plants have been simulated. In particular, this work has focused on the CHP plants that utilize boilers of fluidized bed (FB) type, where the concept of coupling a separate FB reactor to the FB of the boiler forms an important basis for the analyses. In such dual fluidized bed (DFB) technology, heat is transferred from the boiler to the new rector that is operating with other fluidization media than air, thereby enabling other thermochemical processes than combustion to take place. The result of this work shows that broader operations at existing CHP plants have the potential to enable production of significant volumes of chemicals and/or fuels with high efficiency, while maintaining heat supply to external customers. Based on the insight that the technical preconditions for a broader operation are favourable, the motivation and ability among the incumbents in the Swedish CHP sector to participate in a transition of their operation towards a biorefinery was examined. The result of this assessment showed that the incumbents believe that a broader operation can create significant values for their own operations, the society and the environment, but that they lack both a strong motivation as well as important abilities to move into the new technological fields. If the concepts of broader production are widely implemented in the Swedish FB based CHP sector, this can substantially contribute in the transition towards a bioeconomy. Bioeconomy has been identified to hold a great potential for reducing fossil fuel dependence and for maintaining and creating economic growth. Large parts of the combined heat and power (CHP) sector, which successfully have contributed in the transition towards a fossil free society, are at present facing stagnation. District heating actors are facing challenges due to warmer climate, better insulated buildings and competition from heat pumps. The forest industry where CHP plants supplies processes with heat is facing structural changes foremost in the graphic segments. The emerging bioeconomy and the stagnation for the existing business models in large parts of the CHP sector form the background for the examination of additional value-creating processes in the existing CHP structure presented in this thesis. The technical viability for integration of fast pyrolysis, gasification and leaching with existing CHP plants has been analysed as well as the motivation and ability of the CHP incumbents to participate in a transition towards the bioeconomy by developing their plants to biorefineries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{biorefinery}} classification approach developed within International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Task 42. Since production of transportation biofuels {{is seen as the}} driving force for future biorefinery developments, a selection of the most interesting transportation biofuels until 2020 is based on their characteristics to be mixed with gasoline, diesel and natural gas, reflecting the main advantage of using the already-existing infrastructure for easier market introduction. This classification approach relies on four main features: (1) platforms; (2) products; (3) feedstock; and (4) processes. The platforms are the most important feature in this classification approach: they are key intermediates between raw materials and final products, and can be used to link different biorefinery concepts. The adequate combination of these four features represents each individual biorefinery system. The combination of individual biorefinery systems, linked through their platforms, products or feedstocks, provides an overview of the most promising biorefinery systems in a classification network. According to the proposed approach, a biorefinery is described by a standard format as platform(s) - products - and feedstock(s). Processes can be added to the description, if further specification is required. Selected examples of biorefinery classification are provided; for example, (1) one platform (C 6 sugars) biorefinery for bioethanol and animal feed from starch crops (corn); and (2) four platforms (lignin/syngas, C 5 /C 6 sugars) biorefinery for <b>synthetic</b> liquid <b>biofuels</b> (Fischer-Tropsch diesel), bioethanol and animal feed from lignocellulosic crops (switchgrass).

40|$|Abstract Background Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is {{a widely}} used tool to model {{metabolic}} behavior and cellular function. Applications of FBA span a breadth of research from <b>synthetic</b> engineering of <b>biofuels</b> to understanding evolutionary adaptations. FBA predicts metabolic reaction fluxes that optimize a given objective. This objective is generally defined for unicellular organisms by a theoretical reaction which simulates biomass production. FBA has been extremely successful at predicting in E. coli growth rates under different media and gene essentiality, amongst other things. In order to improve predictions, additional constraints are coupled with optimization of the biomass function. Studies have suggested, however, that unicellular organisms - like multicellular organisms - do not grow at optimal rates. To further improve FBA predictions, particularly of internal cell fluxes, new techniques to explore the sub-optimal solution space need to be developed. Results We present an innovative FBA method called corsoFBA based on the optimization of protein cost at sub-optimal objective levels. Our method shows good agreement with experimental data of E. coli grown at different dilution rates. Maintaining the objective function close to its maximum value predicts metabolic states that closely resemble low dilution rates; while higher dilution rates can be mirrored by lowering the biomass production value. By using {{a modified version of}} Extreme Pathways, we are also able to quantify the energy production and overall protein cost for all possible pathways in the central carbon metabolism. Conclusion Metabolic flux distributions at the optimal objective can be substantially different from the near-optimal distributions. Importantly, the behavior of E. coli central carbon metabolism can be better predicted by exploring the sub-optimal FBA solution space. The corsoFBA method presented here is able to predict the behavior of PEP Carboxylase, the glyoxylate shunt and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway at different glucose levels, a behavior not predicted by the minimization of metabolic steps and FBA alone.

40|$|Abstract Background Higher {{plants and}} algae {{are able to}} fix {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store this fixed carbon in large quantities as starch, which can be hydrolyzed into sugars serving as feedstock for fermentation to biofuels and precursors. Rational engineering of carbon flow in plant cells requires {{a greater understanding of}} how starch breakdown fluxes respond to variations in enzyme concentrations, kinetic parameters, and metabolite concentrations. We have therefore developed and simulated a detailed kinetic ordinary differential equation model of the degradation pathways for starch synthesized in plants and green algae, which to our knowledge is the most complete such model reported to date. Results Simulation with 9 internal metabolites and 8 external metabolites, the concentrations of the latter fixed at reasonable biochemical values, leads to a single reference solution showing β-amylase activity to be the rate-limiting step in carbon flow from starch degradation. Additionally, the response coefficients for stromal glucose to the glucose transporter k cat and K M are substantial, whereas those for cytosolic glucose are not, consistent with a kinetic bottleneck due to transport. Response coefficient norms show stromal maltopentaose and cytosolic glucosylated arabinogalactan to be the most and least globally sensitive metabolites, respectively, and β-amylase k cat and K M for starch to be the kinetic parameters with the largest aggregate effect on metabolite concentrations as a whole. The latter kinetic parameters, together with those for glucose transport, have the greatest effect on stromal glucose, which is a precursor for <b>biofuel</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathways. Exploration of the steady-state solution space with respect to concentrations of 6 external metabolites and 8 dynamic metabolite concentrations show that stromal metabolism is strongly coupled to starch levels, and that transport between compartments serves to lower coupling between metabolic subsystems in different compartments. Conclusions We find that in the reference steady state, starch cleavage is the most significant determinant of carbon flux, with turnover of oligosaccharides playing a secondary role. Independence of stationary point with respect to initial dynamic variable values confirms a unique stationary point in the phase space of dynamically varying concentrations of the model network. Stromal maltooligosaccharide metabolism was highly coupled to the available starch concentration. From the most highly converged trajectories, distances between unique fixed points of phase spaces show that cytosolic maltose levels depend on the total concentrations of arabinogalactan and glucose present in the cytosol. In addition, cellular compartmentalization serves to dampen much, but not all, of the effects of one subnetwork on another, such that kinetic modeling of single compartments would likely capture most dynamics that are fast on the timescale of the transport reactions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{regards the}} study of {{alternative}} <b>synthetic</b> routes for <b>biofuels</b> and biochemicals. Biofuels and biochemicals constitute the two main classes of biorefinery products. Biofuels are obtained from biomass and have many environmental advantages over the traditional fuels. In this work particular {{attention has been given}} to biodiesel, {{one of the most widely}} used biofuels. Biodiesel is a safe, non-toxic, and biodegradable alternative diesel fuel. The development of active acid catalysts for biodiesel synthesis could reduce the production costs, in particular because the acid catalysts permit the use of low value feedstocks such as waste and non-edible oils. Biodiesel production occurs with co-production of glycerol, which is co-product also in other industrial productions such as the production of fatty acids and soaps. Because of its large production the market demand is largely less than the supply. For this reason glycerol is considered a problematic product. Possible solution to its disposal is the use as platform chemical in the production of high value bioproducts. Among them are particularly interesting the trioses dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. They could be feedstocks for an alternative synthetic way for lactic acid and its esters. Lactic acid and lactates are, nowadays, considerably important because they are used as building blocks in the production of biodegradable polymers (the polylactic acids), which are potential substitute for petroleum derived polymers. Lactic acid is also one of the most promising bio-based platform molecules. The high costs of the conventional production process hinder the use of lactic acid and lactates in many applications. So it is essential to develop cheaper and greener synthetic routes. In this work catalysts synthesis, characterization of the materials, and catalytic testing have been carried out mainly at the Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry in the Department of Chemical and Geological Sciences of the University of Cagliari. The study involved the use of several techniques for the characterization of the materials. All the catalytic results have been related to the acid properties of the tested materials. For this reason the measurements of adsorption microcalorimetry and adsorption FTIR using basic probe molecules have been the most important used techniques in this work. The measurements of adsorption microcalorimetry were carried out at the Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry in Cagliari while the measurements of adsorption FTIR were carried out under the supervision of Prof. Konstantin Hadjiivanov at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

Cyanobacteria (blue-green microalgae) hold great potential as sources of sustainable bioproducts because {{of their ability to}} convert sunlight and atmospheric carbon-dioxide into energy-rich compounds such as isoprene, a high-value precursor for <b>synthetic</b> rubber and <b>biofuels.</b> Our group has introduced optimized transgenes for an isoprene synthase (IspS) enzyme and a rate-limiting, methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway isomerase (IDI) from poplar into the fast-growing marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, and achieved isoprene synthesis at 4 mg L culture- 112 h day- 1 (~ 40 to 80 -fold higher than previously reported for cyanobacteria). To further improve isoprene yields: 1) a competing glycogen biosynthesis pathway was inactivated, 2) the IspS and IDI genes were targeted to a chromosomal petJ 2 site to improve genetic stability, and 3) a second set of IspS-IDI genes was targeted to a high copy plasmid (pAQ 1) of Synechococcus. I hypothesized that 1) inactivation of glycogen synthesis, a major carbon-storage pathway, will increase carbon flux to isoprene, 2) targeting the IspS-IDI genes to the chromosome will increase their stability, and 3) increasing the copy number of the IpsS and IDI genes, by targeting both the chromosome and plasmid, will further improve isoprene yield. The glgA 1 and glgA 2 glycogen synthase genes were inactivated. However, isoprene production in these Synechococcus strains was only ~ 20 % higher than in strains with functional glycogen synthesis. This suggested that carbon previously used for glycogen synthesis was directed to pathways other than the MEP pathway. Integration of the IspS-IDI transgenes into the chromosomal petJ 2 site (encoding a c 6 -like cytochrome protein) resulted in continuous, stable isoprene production in these strains (petJ 2 ::IspS-IDI) compared to strains carrying these genes only on the plasmid (pAQ 1 ::IspS-IDI). Inactivation of the petJ 2 gene had no observable impact on growth, thus identifying petJ 2 as a suitable site for transgene integration. Increased copies of the IspS-IDI transgenes, achieved by targeting these genes to the plasmid as well as the chromosomal petJ 2 site, resulted in strains (petJ 2 ::IspS-IDI, pAQ 1 ::IspS-IDI) that produced ~ 1. 5 times more isoprene than strains carrying these genes on plasmid pAQ 1 only. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene-expression experiments showed that IspS transcript levels in the petJ 2 ::IspS-IDI strains were several hundred fold higher, especially in old, dense cultures, than in strains with the IspS-IDI genes on plasmid pAQ 1 only. These data demonstrate that improved isoprene yields in the petJ 2 ::IspS-IDI strains resulted both from greater stability of the transgenes and increased mRNA transcript levels. This research demonstrates the utility of the petJ 2 site and chromosomal integration for transgene stability and expression of isoprene synthase (IspS) and MEP pathway genes for enhanced isoprene production. The study further shows that Synechococccus sp. PCC 7002 is an excellent platform for genetic engineering to achieve improved yields of isoprene and other industrially relevant terpenes or bioproduct-biofuel chemicals...|$|R

Thirteen participants from the UK and 15 from Qatar (academics and industrialists) presented stimulating and state-of-the-art research and knowledge transfer ideas in energy and water over 3 days. The Indian workshop was on water, food, and energy nexus and was coordinated by professors Mujtaba and Srinivasan and funded by the Royal Society (UK) and the Department of Science and Technology (India). Three participants from the UK and 15 from India (academics and industrialists) presented stimulating and state-of-the-art research and knowledge transfer ideas in water, food, and energy over 3 days. A total of 40 presentations were made and both events received a great deal of national press coverage.

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{currently}} available thermo-chemical conversion technologies, biomass gasification has received considerable interest since it increases options for combining with various power generation systems. The product gas or syngas produced from biomass gasification is environmental friendly alternatives to conventional petrochemical fuels {{for the production of}} electricity, hydrogen, <b>synthetic</b> transportation <b>biofuels</b> and other chemicals. The product gas normally contains the major components such as CO, H 2, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O, in addition to some organic (e. g., light hydrocarbon species, tar) and inorganic (e. g., H 2 S, HCl, NH 3) impurities depending on operational conditions and gasification processes. Among these impurities, tar can hamper filtration operation and cause equipment fouling due to condensation at lower temperatures, while H 2 S can cause corrosion as well as poisoning of catalysts. Therefore, to avoid these undesired problems, these compounds need to be removed or reduced to certain level prior to the end use of the product gas. Furthermore, the most important heterogeneous reactions occurring in biomass gasification are the water-gas and the Boudouard reactions. Concerning these reactions for several biomass fuels reliable char reaction kinetics are missing, though they are very important for the effective modeling and operation of gasification processes, and the conversion of char has a large influence on the overall gasification efficiency and the yield of the product gas. To improve the product gas quality and the overall gasification efficiency of the process, it is necessary to effectively measure and reduce the formation of sulfur and tar during biomass gasification, as well as to understand char reaction kinetics. This dissertation focuses on these three issues by performing biomass gasification experiments on both an atmospheric 100 kWth steam-O 2 blown circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier at the Delft University of Technology (TUD) and a steam blown 30 - 40 kWth pressurized bubbling fluidized bed (PBFB) gasifier at the Technical University Munich (TUM), and studying char reaction characteristics by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The dissertation is divided into 10 chapters and organized as follows: Chapter 1 briefly addresses the background (i. e., world energy outlook and biomass conversion options) and motivation for this research, the methodology as well as the outline applied in this dissertation. Chapter 2 presents a broad literature overview which mainly consists of four parts: sulfur formation and capture methods, tar formation and measurement techniques, char reactions and kinetics models, and models of (C) FB biomass gasification. Desulfurization can be carried out both in situ by using calcium based sorbents such as limestone and dolomite, and downstream by using regenerable single, mixed, and supported metal oxides. A special attention is paid to experimental conditions of sulfidation and the regeneration of used sorbent materials. Tar formation, primary tar reduction by optimizing of operational conditions and tar measuring techniques in particular on-line during biomass gasification is further introduced. Subsequently, a brief literature study regarding char combustion and gasification with an emphasis on char conversion kinetic models is presented. Finally, currently developed models of CFB biomass gasification are discussed. Chapter 3 presents experimental setups and measuring techniques used in this research. Three different pelletized fuels: a commercial wood pellet product “Agrol”, willow, and a by-product obtained from ethanol production dried distiller’s grains with solubles (DDGS) have been tested on the CFB gasifier and the PBFB gasifier. The product gas produced from gasification has been analyzed using different analytical instruments. Three different tar measuring techniques have been used to quantify tar concentrations: a quasi-continuous TA 120 - 3 on-line tar analyzer (OTA) using a flame ionization detector (FID) originally developed by IVD, an on-line laser instrument based on induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) developed by TUM and an off-line solid phase adsorption (SPA) technique developed by KTH. A TGA-FTIR system has been used to study the pyrolysis of three fuels and the reaction behavior of their residual chars: CFB-char obtained after three fuels gasification in the CFB gasifier and TG-derived PYR-Char obtained after three fuels pyrolysis in the TGA. The physical and chemical properties of CFB-chars were studied by using powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD), X-Ray fluorescence (XRF), N 2 adsorption/desorption at - 196 ºC and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive scattering (EDS). Although experimental study of sulfur distribution and capture during biomass gasification is very important, the process could be time-consuming as well as challenging due to limitations and availabilities of sulfur measuring techniques. Thus, thermodynamic equilibrium simulations concerning sulfur species have been performed in two parts using FactsageTM software package version 5. 4. 1 and the results are presented in chapter 4. Part 1 : the distribution of sulfur species during the gasification of six different biomass fuels at various temperatures ranging from 700 - 1200 °C, where effects of different operational parameters, including fuel properties and types, temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio (ER) and mineral content on the distribution behavior of sulfur species are systematically investigated and compared with the available experimental data. Part 2 : sulfur capture behavior of various sorbent materials like limestone, lime, CuO, ZnO, FeO and MnO by using a simulated gas composition obtained from three different gasifiers, where sulfidation and regeneration capacities of different sorbents are examined. In general, the predicted results show that H 2 S is the predominant sulfur species and its maximum concentration is closely related to the fuel-S content. For all the fuels, around 95 % fuel-S is converted into H 2 S during the reaction. Minerals in the fuels, especially the metal Fe, {{play an important role in}} the retention of sulfur in the solid phase. Sulfidation and regeneration simulation results indicate that copper, manganese and zinc oxides are the most favorable metals, which are capable of reaching even ppb level at a temperature of about 650 °C, while at temperatures higher than 900 °C calcium based oxides exhibit a better potential than other metal oxides, only their desulfurization capabilities are strongly limited by the temperature range and gas composition especially the H 2 O and CO 2 contents. Chapter 5 and chapter 6 mainly discuss the experimental results obtained from biomass gasification on both gasifiers. Chapter 5 analyses effects of operational conditions (e. g., steam to biomass ratio (SBR), ER, gasification temperature, pressure) and bed materials on the distribution of the main product gas, sulfur and tar formation from Agrol, willow and DDGS gasification. The results indicated that under atmospheric pressure higher temperatures and SBR were more favorable for H 2 production but less advantageous for the formation of CO and CH 4, whereas a higher SBR also led to a lower carbon conversion efficiency (CCE%), cold gas efficiency (CGE%) and heating values of the product gas. Higher pressures can significantly promote the formation of CH 4. Due to a relatively high K and Cl content in DDGS fuel, continually adding 3 to 10 % kaolin (based on feeding rate) into the reactor was needed to avoid agglomeration. Furthermore, different amounts of tar were produced from three fuels, but in all cases it mainly contains phenol, cresol, naphthalene, indene and pyrene. Higher temperatures and higher SBR were favorable for tar decomposition. Chapter 6 compares the results obtained from three tar measuring techniques in three different ways: on-line analysis behavior of the LIFS and OTA methods, individual tar components quantification of the SPA and LIFS methods and the total tar content analysis using the SPA, LIFS and OTA methods. Possibilities for improving the OTA analyzer have been recommended based on experimental results. The analyzed results showed that the measured concentrations of 10 individual tar species obtained from the CFB and PBFB atmospheric pressure tests using the SPA and LIFS methods agreed reasonably well with a difference of less than 10 % between the measured tar concentrations. Both the LIFS and OTA methods can be used as an indicator to monitor the change of the gasifier performance in real time; however, it appeared that the LIFS method was more accurate, and a regular calibration -preferably daily- of the OTA method is required in order to achieve reliable tar measurement results. Chapter 7 and chapter 8 discuss the experimental results concerning the pyrolysis of three fuels, and gasification and combustion of their derived chars. Chapter 7, firstly presents the characterization results of CFB-Chars obtained from different analytical techniques; then it analyses the pyrolysis behavior of the three fuels under different heating rates (HR); finally it compares the gasification behavior of CFB-Char and char obtained after pyrolysis (PYR-Char) under different operational conditions (e. g., gasification temperature, CO 2 concentration). The kinetic parameters have been determined using the volumetric reaction model (VRM) and the shrinking core model (SCM). The analyzed results from TGA-FTIR tests showed that Agrol and willow had a similar pyrolysis behavior, and the volatiles released from Agrol, willow and DDGS pyrolysis were mainly CO, CO 2 and H 2 O, followed by a small amount of CH 4. Char gasification rate increased with increasing temperature, CO 2 concentration and HR. At low gasification temperature with low CO 2 concentration, CFB-Chars were much more reactive than PYR-Chars. Agrol char samples despite showing large specific surface areas had a low reactivity, due to their low ash content and related high crystalline order. On the other hand, the large ash content in DDGS char, in particularly K component, might catalyze its char gasification, balancing the reduced surface area. Chapter 8 analyses the experimental results regarding the combustion of willow and DDGS CFB-chars, and pure charcoal under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, as well as the modeling results obtained from a 3 D TG furnace model which has been built by using COMSOL MultiphysicsTM software in order to better understand both temperature and gas velocity profiles within the TG furnace under the condition with and without considering char combustion. The results showed that the char combustion rate increased with increasing either O 2 concentrations or combustion temperatures. Within the temperature range of 750 to 900 °C, it was impossible to determine kinetic parameters for combustion experiments of DDGS and willow chars, but well possible for charcoal under conditions with 15 vol. % O 2 (Ea was around 120 kJ/mol calculated by using the SCM model). Furthermore, a fairly good agreement was observed between the predicted results from COMSOL MultiphysicsTM model and experimental ones. Chapter 9 presents the modeling of the 100 kWth steam-O 2 blown CFB gasifier with an emphasis on the product gas distribution and equilibrium analysis of water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and methane steam reforming (MSR) reaction. Three different types of models: an equilibrium model (EM) and a kinetic model (KM) setup in Aspen PlusTM software, and a fluidization model (FM) written in C Language and compiled using software Bloodshed Dev-C++ have been developed. The modeling results achieved from different models are compared and validated with the experimental data. Compared to the product gas composition obtained from experiments, H 2 concentration predicted from the EM model was much higher, while CO, CO 2, H 2 O concentrations were slightly lower and almost no CH 4 was predicted from the pure EM model; however, as expected, the concentrations of all gas species predicted from the KM model agreed fairly well with those obtained from experiments. Both the EM and KM models indicated that the WGS reaction and the MSR reaction largely influenced the concentration of H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O and CH 4. Finally, chapter 10 concludes the main experimental and modeling results and provides some recommendations for further research as well.
