5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> {{he had first}} considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of a}} German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E

5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
5|$|Such events {{implanted}} in the Polish collective memory the image of Jewish crowds greeting the invading Red Army as liberators, and willing collaborators, further strengthening Żydokomuna <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> held Jews responsible for collaboration with the Soviet authorities in importing communism into divided Poland. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, widespread notion of Judeo-Communism, combined with the German Nazi encouragement for expression of antisemitic attitudes, {{may have been a}} principal cause of massacres of Jews by gentile Poles in Poland's northeastern Łomża province in the summer of 1941, including the massacre at Jedwabne according to Joanna B. Michlic. However, the responsibility of the gentile Poles for the Jedwabne pogrom has been highly disputed, with some sources stating that the Germans were the principal authors of the massacre.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This {{was one of the}} worst seasons in {{franchise}} history. There is some <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> the 1986 team was even worse than the winless team of 1976, and the 473 points conceded was not beaten by any NFL team until the 2001 Indianapolis Colts gave up 486. The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the top pick in the draft, but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either the draft or free agency. They entered the season with a roster nearly identical to the previous season's 2–14 team.|$|E
5|$|The prompt {{accomplishments of}} the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir's {{executive}} ability resulted in Mashbir being promoted to full colonel by General Douglas MacArthur after only one month. Mashbir then joined the forefront of MacArthur's intelligence activities and Japanese surrender negotiations, remaining the Commandant of ATIS until December 1945. He was made famous {{at the time in}} the motion picture and still photograph of the preliminary surrender negotiations at Manila, as the man who pushed the ink-well, indicating that General Richard K. Sutherland should correct the Japanese Instrument of Surrender; and also as the man who thumbed the Japanese Lieutenant General Torashirō Kawabe along as he attempted to shake hands. The second incident provoked some mixed feelings, including <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> it could have damaged surrender talks. Mashbir also played a critical role retrieving and translating the Z Plan and in organizing the final surrender of Japan. In his autobiography, Mashbir explained that he was not permitted to shake hands, and {{that it would have been}} rude to point, which ultimately lead to the awkward thumbing motion that was photographed.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

5|$|Greene {{was again}} {{temporarily}} elevated to command of his division, now designated {{part of the}} XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac, at the Battle of Antietam. His division's three brigades were led by junior officers who had survived Cedar Mountain. Even though XII Corps commander Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield was killed shortly after the fighting began, Greene led a crushing attack against the Confederates near the Dunker Church, achieving the farthest penetration of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's lines than any Union unit. Under immense pressure, Greene held his small division (only 1,727 men engaged {{at the start of}} the day) in advance of the rest of the army for four hours, but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses. While the division was posted to Harpers Ferry, Greene took a three-week sick leave. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard speculated that Greene, like many of his fellow officers, was sickened by the stench of dead and wounded at Antietam. When he returned, there was a new division commander, Brig. Gen. Geary. Greene was disgruntled that Geary, with only a few days seniority over him, was selected for the post; Geary had been wounded at Cedar Mountain and his combat record was not as good, but his political connections and a <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> a wounded officer should not be set back in his career unnecessarily, gave him the nod.|$|E
5|$|In {{a bid to}} stem Haidar's rise, the British {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, culminating in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) {{and was able to}} successfully sue for peace. In 1770, when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore (three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Haider's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider's deep distrust of the British—a <b>sentiment</b> <b>that</b> would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of Saunshi and came out victorious during the same year.|$|E
25|$|Many {{practicing}} mathematicians {{have been}} drawn to their subject because {{of a sense of}} beauty they perceive in it.

40|$|According to {{traditional}} error theory, sentiment measurements vary unsystematically from individual to individual. However, we find some patterned deviation in <b>sentiments</b> <b>that</b> characterize subsets of respondents within a seemingly homogeneous population. After demonstrating {{the existence of}} such patterns, we report an exploratory study aimed at identifying social characteristics of people with different patterns of sentiments. People embedded in multiple social networks have exaggerated <b>sentiments</b> <b>that</b> contour cultural patterns, and people with few social associations have attenuated sentiments conveying cultural detachment. In addition, people with disciplinary parents and romantic privation have some distinctive sentiments, depending on their gender. Culture strongly constrains sentiments about conventional roles, behaviors, and personal attributes. Indeed, <b>sentiments</b> <b>that</b> are attached to social categories can be viewed as part of culture; we thereby expect little variation in sentiments among competent bearers of the culture (Romney, Weller, and Batchelder 1986). David Heise (1966) provided empirical support for this view, finding that navy enlistees from the whole nation yielded about the same average sentiment measurements as did college students from the Midwest, and he concluded that “the attitudinal association o...|$|R
