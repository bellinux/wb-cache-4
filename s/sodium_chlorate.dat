40|$|Background: Hydroxyapatite is {{generally}} considered a viable substitute for bone {{in a number of}} medical procedures such as bone repair, bone augmentation and coating metal implants. Unfortunately, hydroxyapatite has poor mechanical properties that make it unsuitable for many load bearing applications. Methods: In the present work various grades of finely crushed Pinctada maxima (pearl oyster shell) were combined with a nanometer scale hydroxyapatite powder to form novel composite materials. A comparative study was made between the various powder based composites synthesized. The crystalline structure and morphology of the various powder based composites were investigated using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The composite materials were also evaluated and characterized. Results: Manufactured hydroxyapatite powders were composed of crystalline spherical/granular particles with a mean size of 30 nm. Also produced were hydroxyapatite and finely crushed calcium carbonate from Pinctada maxima (pearl oyster shell) powder mixtures. Hydroxyapatite coatings produced on Pinctada maxima nacre substrates were investigated and their surface characteristics reported. Conclusions: Pinctada maxima nacre pre-treated with <b>sodium</b> hypo <b>chlorate</b> before hydroxyapatite deposition produced a superior coating and could be used for bone tissue engineering. But further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate the biocompatibility and long term stability of this composite coating...|$|R
500|$|Perchlorates and {{perchloric acid}} (HOClO3) {{are the most}} stable oxo-compounds of {{chlorine}}, {{in keeping with the}} fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the chlorine atom is in its lowest (−1) or highest (+7) possible oxidation states. Perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated, in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons. Perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous sodium perchlorate or barium perchlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it. Anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds, sets hydrogen iodide and thionyl chloride on fire and even oxidises silver and gold.

500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate,</b> mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp.

However, chlorate can be formed as a by-product when chlorine-containing substances are used, e. g. for cleaning or disinfection purposes. The intake of chlorate may cause adverse effects on red blood cells and inhibition of iodide uptake in the thyroid gland. However, consumers should not fundamentally change their dietary habits, since {{the health benefits of}} fruit and vegetables continues to be undisputed.

40|$|A brief {{survey of}} the {{structural}} and thermodynamic aspects of ionic double layer theory is made. The recent advances {{in the study of}} adsorption of organic compounds at mercury-solution interfaces are discussed. Frumkin’s theory of the adsorption of organic compound is presented and the recent developments in the field by Frumkin and co-workers are highlighted. Butler’s theory of organic adsorption, the electrostatic model (proposed by Devanathan), Hansen’s mode, the molecular approach to adsorption (proposed by Bockris and co-workers) and the generalized surface layer model (proposed by Frumkin and Damaskin) are also reviewed. The congruence problem of adsorption isotherms has been presented and the implications of pseudo and simultaneous congruence are discussed at length. The adsorption of phenol, pyrocatechol (O-dihydroxybenzene) and phloroguchinol (sym. Trihydroxybenzene) were studied using capacity and interfacial tension measurements. An aqueous solution of 0. 5 M <b>sodium</b> per <b>chlorate</b> was used as supporting electrolyte in all the experiments. Differential capacitance measurements were carried out using an a. c. bridge and DME at 400 Hz. In addition, the adsorption of phloroglucinol was investigated using a HMDE at a frequency of 30 Hz. Interfacial tension measurements of pyrocatechol were carried out using a Lippmann capillary electrometer. A maximum bullble pressure electrometer was also constructed and used for acquiring interfacial tension data for phloroglucinol. The results were processed using an IBM 370 / 155 operating system. Separate programmes were written to process differential capacity and interfacial tension data. Both constant charge and constant potential analysis were carried out. The programmes were so designed to yield all the necessary derived data required for the interpretation of the adsorption of organic compounds. Isotherm fits were also carried out using these programmes. Phloroglucinol exhibited a peculiar behavior at the interface. Where as the mono and di hydroxyl substituted benzenes behaved as normal aromatic compounds, the symmetric hydroxy benzene alone showed a break in the capacitance-potential curves; this behavior resembled the one exhibited by Camphor. Adamentanol and Borneol with undergo two dimensional condensation. However, the fine structure of the capacitance curves of phloroglucinol was different from the C-E curves of the above mentioned compounds. Phloroglucinol showed well-defined desorption peaks at all concentrations showed well-defined desorption peaks at all concentrations (except the lowest) and the break occurred after the peak; the capacitance curves for different concentrations fused together at the adsorption region, but the capacitance was much higher (13 F/cm 2) than that observed for a condensed monolayer. For the isotherm analysis, Frumkin, FVT (free volume theory) and Florry isotherms were chosen, Tests of congruence were made and conclusions drawn on the basis of two different tests. Isotherm fit could not be carried out for the capacitance data of phloroglucinol since as ‘all or none’ adsorption behavior was exhibited. Hence isotherm fit was attempted using electrocapillary data. Strangely enougn a potential dependent negative ‘a’ value (indicative of repulsion) was obtained even though the E-C curves showed a condensation type behavior. FVT isotherm fit to the same data (and to other two substances too) yielded and almost potential independent ‘a’ value. The results (both at constant charge and constant potential) of isotherm fits were discussed in the light of these observations. The M- 2 vs plots at constant charge density were linear in the case of pyocatechol and phloroglucinol. But, phenol exhibited a distinct break at positive surface charge densities. This result is analysed along with the corresponding. E vs plot at constance E for any possible reorientation of the adsorbate. The field dependence of free energies of adsorption and the interaction constants for all the three energies of adsorption and the interaction constants for all the three compounds are compared and a general discussion is given relating on the structural aspects. A model for the structure of the double layer in presence of phloroglucinol has been advanced based on the research obtained by us and the available crystallographic data of phloroglucinol and its dehydrate...|$|R
