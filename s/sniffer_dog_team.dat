40|$|The current global {{order has}} thrown up yet another bewildering {{language}} problem: the monolingual <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog!</b> I glean the following {{from a recent}} NYT article about Rabbis in Montana: with all the concerns about homeland security, the US has an expanding need for <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs.</b> Training <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs</b> locally is costly (the article quotes US$ 20, 000 for a “bomb dog”) so the business is being outsourced to those who can do it cheaper and much like sneakers a <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> is “assembled” internationally. In the case reported on in the article, the dog was bred in the Netherlands, then shipped to Israel for training, and then imported to Montana to serve with the Helena Police Department. The problem arose when the dog-handler in Helena discovered that the dog had been trained on Hebrew commands and wouldn’t respond to his English-accented pronunciation of those commands...|$|R

50|$|In <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> situations, {{the police}} are {{generally}} required to take quick action guided by on the spot observations. In circumstances where this generally occurs, it is not feasible to subject the “sniffer dog’s” sniff to prior judicial authorization. Both the subject and his suspicious belongings would be long gone before the paperwork could be done. In the particular context of <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs,</b> there is sufficient protection for {{the public in the}} prior requirement of reasonable suspicion and after the fact judicial review to satisfy the “reasonableness” requirement of s. 8.The trade off for permitting the police to deploy their dogs on a “reasonable suspicion” standard without a warrant is that if this procedure is abused and <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> searches proceed without reasonable suspicion based on objective facts, the consequence could well tip the balance against the admission of the evidence if it is established under s. 24(2) of the Charter that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.|$|R
40|$|Police <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{essential}} in preventing and also detecting drug crime. However, the existing legal framework {{related to the}} use of police dogs is fragile and nebulous, as it is primarily based on searches carried out by police officers. This report discusses the legal framework within this field. Particular emphasis is put on the difference between using <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs</b> in searches requiring a formal search warrant, and searches that do not need any formal decision, due to their non-intrusive nature. This divide will be illustrated by examples of dog-assisted searches during routine police work such as beat patrols, in venues, schools and in traffic controls...|$|R
