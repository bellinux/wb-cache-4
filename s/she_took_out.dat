Thomas obtained an indictment of Wilcox, charging her with 36 felony counts related to failing to disclose business loans <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> from the business finance arm of an organization which had business before the Board of Supervisors. In February, 2010, Pima County Judge John Leonardo, appointed by a special master of the Arizona Supreme Court to hear the matter, ruled that Thomas had acted unethically, and had prosecuted Wilcox for political gain and retaliation, despite conflicts of interest that should have precluded his office from prosecuting. In January, 2011, After a 10-month review, Gila County Attorney Daisy Flores concluded there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal case against Wilcox. Wilcox sued the county and was awarded a settlement of nearly 1 million in 2011. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling.|$|E
