It was also reequipped with the updated ISU-152 <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun,</b> one of which Snetkov became commander of. Snetkov and his regiment {{did not return to}} the front until June 1944, where they became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant around this time, and from late June, he fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive that recaptured Belarus and eastern Poland. Between 22 and 27 June, during fighting in the Bogushevsk area, Snetkov's crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun,</b> two bunkers, and two anti-tank guns. For this he received a second Order of the Red Star on 10 July. The regiment, as part of the front, fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Gumbinnen Operation during the fall.|$|E
5|$|Tetrarchs {{did not see}} {{any further}} combat and were deemed {{obsolete}} by 1946; the last was retired in 1950.

5|$|The T30 Howitzer Motor Carriage (HMC) was a United States Army <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun</b> used in World War II. Its {{design was}} based on {{requirements}} for an assault gun issued by the Armored Force in 1941 and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all artillery, {{including}} howitzers, guns, anti-aircraft and rockets, were {{tasked with}} anti-tank defence. Dug-in tanks and self-propelled guns further strengthened the anti-tank defences. Anti-tank forces {{were incorporated into}} every level of command, mostly as anti-tank strong points with the majority concentrated on likely attack routes and the remainder amply spread out elsewhere. Each anti-tank strong-point typically consisted of four to six anti-tank guns, six to nine anti-tank rifles, and five to seven heavy and light machine guns. They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments {{as well as by}} infantry with automatic firearms. Independent tank and <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun</b> brigades and regiments were tasked with cooperating with the infantry during counterattacks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Self-propelled</b> <b>guns</b> {{are mounted}} on a {{motorised}} wheeled or tracked chassis (because of this they are sometimes mistaken for tanks). As such the gun can be maneuvered under its own power {{as opposed to a}} towed gun that relies upon a vehicle or other means to be moved on the battlefield. <b>Self-propelled</b> <b>guns</b> are combat support weapons; they are employed by combat support units fighting in support of, or attached to, the main combat units: infantry and armour. <b>Self-propelled</b> <b>guns</b> are best at providing indirect fire but can give direct fire when needed.It may be armoured, in which case it is considered an armoured fighting vehicle (AFV). Typically, <b>self-propelled</b> <b>guns</b> are more lightly armoured and may not have turrets and their purpose is distinct from that of tanks.|$|R

5|$|In October 1944 {{however, the}} {{remaining}} Tetrarchs of the regiment {{were replaced by}} Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945. The tanks did not perform well in action; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun.</b> Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action, occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company. The tanks were forced {{to withdraw from the}} position after several hours however, because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties. The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946. A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post-war period however; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments, and the Egyptian Army used several company-sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1941, {{officials}} in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer {{to be used by}} the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour, as well as their poor performance during the conflict. Consequently, the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced, and none ever saw combat. A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design in light of this decision, including equipping reconnaissance units with them, or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence. One variant on the Mk VIII was designed, the Alecto <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun</b> which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close-support vehicle by airborne forces; however only a few were ever produced and they were never used in combat.|$|E
5|$|Snetkov {{was born}} on 27 February 1925 in Saratov, and {{graduated}} from Pugachyov's School No. 2. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1942 and in October 1943 graduated from accelerated courses at the 2nd Kiev Self-Propelled Artillery School as a junior lieutenant. As commander of an SU-152 <b>self-propelled</b> <b>gun</b> in the 9th Separate Guards Breakthrough Tank Regiment of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 38th Army, Snetkov saw his first combat west of Rozhiv in the Battle of Kiev on 25 November, during which his crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a Tiger tank and two guns. For his actions, Snetkov received the Order of the Red Star on 12 December. As the advance westwards across Ukraine continued into the winter, he and his regiment fought in the Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive and the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive {{as part of the}} 38th Army. During the latter operation, on 26 January, his crew was reported by a superior to have engaged a German tank column of about 20 tanks and destroyed three, one of which was a Tiger, on the LipovetsRososhe road. For this action, Snetkov received the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, on 2 February.|$|E
