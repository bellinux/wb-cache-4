5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes.</b> In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for movement of deposited snow: drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> snowmelt during thaw conditions, {{and the movement}} of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice.|$|E
5|$|Today, sandstone, shale, granite, and {{serpentine}} are {{the primary}} rock types in the Chetco region. Various forms of loam comprise its soil. Erosion levels are high due {{to a combination of}} high precipitation, <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> and landslides, which can result in earthflows.|$|E
25|$|The {{probable}} derivation of {{the name}} is estate {{at the foot of}} a <b>steep</b> <b>slope.</b> <b>Steep</b> <b>slope</b> was from the Saxon word scor. pronounced shor, but written sore by Norman scribes.|$|R
50|$|The gentler slopes to {{the east}} and north are settled, while the <b>steeper</b> <b>slopes</b> to the west and south are free of buildings. The <b>steepest</b> <b>slope</b> is to the south, where it reaches the sea within a {{distance}} of 400 meters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> between Essen-Werden and Essen Stadtwald {{has always}} placed a high demand on the {{vehicles}} operating on it. The Essen-Hügel station {{was built on}} a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> at the instigation of the Krupp family next to the Villa Hügel.|$|R
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E
5|$|When powdery, snow drifts {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was covered by a Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E
50|$|An {{escarpment}} is a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> or long cliff {{that forms}} as {{an effect of}} faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually escarpment is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian scarpa, shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where escarpment refers to the margin between two landforms, while scarp is synonymous with a cliff or <b>steep</b> <b>slope.</b> The surface of the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> is called a scarp face.This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle(dip) slope {{on one side and}} a <b>steep</b> (scarp) <b>slope</b> on the other side.|$|R

5|$|Both the Mont Blanc massif, and the Aiguilles Rouges {{range to}} its north, now {{form part of}} the {{external}} zone of the Alps, effectively being the outermost layers of rock. The central granites make up Mont Blanc, the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> of the Drus, the Grandes Jorasses and the Dent du Géant, and at the highest points are topped by schists, which are visible {{in places such as}} Grands Montets and near Mont Blanc's summit.|$|E

To {{the south of the}} parliamentary complex are the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat. The Holyrood and Dumbiedykes areas, {{to the west of the}} site, have been extensively redeveloped since 1998, with new retail, hotel and office developments, including Barclay House, the new offices of The Scotsman Publications Ltd.|$|E
5|$|The steepest basin in the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} {{is in the}} Alvin Bush Lake sub-watershed, with {{an average}} slope of 19.12 degrees. Other sub-watersheds with <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> include Spicewood Run (18.54 degrees), Walters Run (17.32 degrees), middle Kettle Creek (16.78 degrees), and Hammersley Fork (16.24 degrees). The least steep basin in the watershed is Twomile Run, with an average slope of 8.32 degrees.|$|E

40|$|This study {{takes the}} <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> of Qianlin Mountain in Beijing National Forest Park as an example. The job of {{engineering}} applications and comparative analysis are done {{as well as}} estimating the protection effect. Because of the complicated formation and geological conditions of the <b>steep</b> <b>slope,</b> accidents such as slope instability, collapsing are easier to happen. Therefore, the technology of the reinforcement and protection of <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> are important. Even the methods are improper; it remains a significant security risk. Given the limitations {{of a variety of}} protection technologies, a new method called spray-anchor technology mixed flexible protection is proposed...|$|R
5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and <b>steep</b> <b>slopes.</b> Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E
5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines were {{surrounded}} {{from all sides}} now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> others tried to escape in the waters, only to be smashed on the rocks below and again others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, {{a large number of}} the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in this battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle, although they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate and describe agricultural land handicapped by <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> and to assess agricultural expertsf attitude towards impact of terrain factor on the generic farming activity. This paper analyses differences and similarities between Lithuanian rural elderships affected by <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> constraint (i. e. ≥ 7 ° (15 %) slope gradient) with the subsequent evaluation in selected agronomical variables. In total 514 rural elderships were classified into five groups by percentage of agricultural land with <b>steep</b> <b>slope.</b> The assessment of agricultural variables by <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> groups revealed that the best developed are elderships (60. 12 %) falling into Group I, where mean value of area under <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> was 0. 32 %. Very unfavourable conditions, especially for intensive farming, were identified in Group V (7. 59 % elderships), where the topographical character has a dominantly hilly terrain. Agricultural expertsf (scientists) for survey was used assessing the respondents attitude (6 -point Likert Scale) towards terrain impact on the items related to generic farming sector, i. e., "Agricultural development", "Farming systems use", "Land utilization possibilities" and "Soil erosion". The surveyed experts considered that terrain is a factor influencing land-use decisions and the item "Land utilization possibilities" has assumed the highest mean score (3. 77). Therefore it should be a good overview of agricultural land with <b>steep</b> <b>slope,</b> {{as one of the most}} important natural agri-environmental constraint affecting generic farming possibilities in Lithuania...|$|R
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} Schmitt {{established}} radio {{communication with the}} 1st Battalion, 9th infantry. When daylight came Schmitt and his group {{saw that they were}} surrounded by North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> outside the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is located}} off the National Highway 31A (NH31A), which links Sevok to Gangtok. The NH31A is an {{offshoot}} of the NH 31, which connects Sevok to Siliguri. These two National Highways together, via Sevok, links Kalimpong to the plains. Regular bus services and hired vehicles connect Kalimpong with Siliguri and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong, Darjeeling and Gangtok. Four wheel drives are popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> in the region. However, road communication often get disrupted in the monsoons due to landslides. In the town, people usually travel by foot. Residents also use bicycle, two-wheelers and hired taxis for short distances.|$|E
