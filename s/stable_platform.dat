5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders had {{a number}} of preparatory hurdles to {{overcome}} before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, been carrying out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. The muddy ground did not provide a <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> for the guns and howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart (who took over command of the Rifle Brigade following Young's wounding), they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} several decades of the 20th century, other inventors {{attempted}} (unsuccessfully) to use gyroscopes {{as the basis for}} early black box navigational systems by creating a <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> from which accurate acceleration measurements could be performed (in order to bypass the need for star sightings to calculate position). Similar principles were later employed in the development of inertial navigation systems for ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|On {{arrival at}} the site of the wind turbine, MPI Resolution lowers her six legs to stand on the seabed, and then jacks herself up above the surface of the sea.

25|$|To reduce {{errors in}} sensing {{attitude}} and velocity, designers cut friction {{to a minimum}} in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen. The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 l) of gas at 3,000 psig (pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 MPa). This sphere is 21inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, {{to the left of}} the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings in the <b>stable</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a night fighter {{that was}} not {{expected}} to be as fast as smaller daylight fighters, the expectation was to have a <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> for its radar system and the four 20mm cannon mounted in the lower fuselage. The F3D was, however, able to outturn a MiG-15. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 tracking radar, both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 tail warning radar. The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, which was produced before the advent of semiconductor electronics, required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of shipboard profile measurements of mean temperature, mean humidity and mean wind over {{the open ocean}} is examined {{on the basis of}} six hours and 20 minutes of simultaneous profile measurements made from the R/V Acania on 20 - 21 September 1973 near San Nicolas Island, California. Comparisons of the profiles obtained from the shipboard measurements, as well as the meteorological parameters derived from those profiles are made with results obtained from more <b>stable</b> <b>platforms.</b> Parameters examined include the Richardson number, the friction velocity, the drag coefficient and the roughness length. The drag coefficient and roughness length were found to be generally larger than those obtained from more <b>stable</b> <b>platforms,</b> but the Richardson number and the relationships between the various parameters, as well as the profiles of wind speed and temperature themselves, compare favorably. The results indicate that a ship can be a suitable platform for measuring profiles. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

500|$|The {{self-propelled}} {{anti-aircraft gun}} began development in 1969 {{to provide this}} type of vehicle to the French Army and for export. Although ultimately none were ordered for France, in 1975 Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version, denominated the AMX-30SA. Developed to defend against low-altitude attacks, the system included two Hispano-Suiza [...] 831 A automatic guns, coupled to an Oeil-noir fire control system. This system had already been installed on the AMX-13, {{in lieu of a}} heavier chassis, using a turret designated the S 401 A. Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an analogue computer, receiving information from a Doppler radar, which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.|$|E

50|$|A British {{attack on}} the ninth on Bellevue Spur {{and part of the}} main Passchendaele ridge gained a little ground at {{prohibitive}} cost. Heavy swathes of barbed wire still girdled the hillside, however, and belated and meagre heavy artillery made no impression on them, nor on the many pillboxes beyond. New Zealand gunners slaved to breaking point to get only a few guns and howitzers forward, but <b>stable</b> <b>platforms</b> and accurate fire were unattainable.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} as [...] "The Cottonbalers" [...] from an mythological {{incident}} cited during the Battle of New Orleans, while {{under the command of}} Andrew Jackson, when soldiers of the 7th Infantry Regiment held positions behind a breastwork of bales of cotton during the British attack. Cotton bales were in fact used on Line Jackson. Cotton bales were sunk into the mud to help create more <b>stable</b> <b>platforms</b> for cannons, not as breastworks.|$|R

2500|$|A brawler is {{a fighter}} who {{generally}} lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but {{makes up for}} it through sheer punching power. [...] Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more <b>stable</b> <b>platform</b> and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also {{have a tendency to}} ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as Wilfredo Gómez, Prince Naseem Hamed and Danny García.|$|E

50|$|A {{spar buoy}} is a tall, thin buoy that floats upright {{in the water}} and is {{characterized}} by a small water plane area and a large mass. Because they tend to be <b>stable</b> ocean <b>platforms,</b> spar buoys are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the water plane area and the mass allows spar buoys to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large water plane area buoys such as discus buoys that tend to be wave followers. Spar buoys are often used as <b>stable</b> <b>platforms</b> for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar buoys range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar buoys has been studied.|$|R
