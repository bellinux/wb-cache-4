40|$|AbstractReproductive hormones {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to modulate both gap and tight junction protein expression in the ovary and other reproductive tissues, however the effects of changes in reproductive hormones on the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain unclear. Age-related declines in BBB integrity correlate {{with the loss of}} serum sex steroids and increase in gonadotropins with menopause/andropause. To examine the effect of reproductive senescence on BBB permeability and gap and tight junction protein expression/localization, female mice at 3  months of age were either sham operated (normal serum E 2 and <b>gonadotropins),</b> ovariectomized (low <b>serum</b> E 2 and high <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins)</b> or ovariectomized and treated with the GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate (low serum E 2 and gonadotropins). Ovariectomy induced a 2. 2 -fold increase in Evan's blue dye extravasation into the brain. The expression and localization of the cytoplasmic membrane-associated tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO- 1) in microvessels was not altered among groups indicating that the increased paracellular permeability was not due to changes in this tight junction protein. However, ovariectomy induced a redistribution of the gap junction protein connexin- 43 (Cx 43) such that immunoreactivity relocalized from along the extracellular microvascular endothelium to become associated with endothelial cells. An increase in Cx 43 expression in the mouse brain following ovariectomy was suppressed in ovariectomized animals treated with leuprolide acetate, indicating that <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> rather than sex steroids were modulating Cx 43 expression. These results suggest that elevated <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> following reproductive senescence may be one possible cause of the loss of selective permeability of the BBB at this time. Furthermore, these findings implicate Cx 43 in mediating changes in BBB permeability, and <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> in the cerebropathophysiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
40|$|Serum androgens decline {{with age}} in normal men, despite normal or {{elevated}} bioactive <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins,</b> suggesting that primary testicular dysfunction occurs with aging. The authors further assessed {{the question of}} age-related testicular dysfunction by evaluating whether raising <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> above the normal serum range for an extended time in healthy elderly men might result in bringing their gonadal function to a level similar to that found in young adult men. Five elderly (65 to 85 years old) and five young adult men (26 to 33 years old) were given 50 mg of clomiphene citrate (CC) twice a day for 8 weeks to stimulate gonadotropin production. During that time, testosterone (T), non-sex hormone-binding globulin bound T, and estradiol increased significantly in both age groups, while serum inhibin increased significantly only in the young adult men. The increases in serum androgens with CC administration were significantly greater in the young adult men than in the elderly men. These hormone changes occurred {{in the setting of}} <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> that increased significantly in both age groups, although there was a tendency for the elderly men to have a smaller increase in luteinizing hormone. Despite 8 weeks of stimulation of the pituitary-gonadal axis by CC administration, the elderly men demonstrated significantly diminished testicular responses compared with the young adult men. Sertoli cell function, as determined by inhibin production, was more diminished in the elderly men than was Leydig cell function. These data strengthen the hypothesis that normal aging in men is accompanied by a decline in testicular function. ...|$|R

Continued exposure to LD 6 : 18 resulted in gradual increases in <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> levels and subsequently in the complete recrudescence (regrowth) of the testes by 25 weeks.

Peri-pubertal Wistar male rats (45 days old) were divided into two groups: control (saline 0. 9 %) and cisplatin (1 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks, i. p.). The study was conducted in two steps and evaluations were performed at ages of 66 (post-pubertal age) and 140 (adult age) days on: (i) organ weights, <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> and testosterone levels, sperm counts, motility and morphology, testicular histomorphometry, spermatogenesis kinetics, Sertoli cell number and in situ detection of apoptotic germ cells and (ii) sexual behaviour, fertility and intratesticular testosterone. At the end of cisplatin therapy, rats showed reductions in sperm production and reserves, sperm with progressive movement, tubular diameter, intratesticular testosterone and fertility potential, but increased numbers of TUNEL-positive seminiferous tubules, immotile sperm and pre-implantation losses compared with control. Moreover, cisplatin-treated post-pubertal rats displayed impaired testicular histopathology and sexual behaviour. <b>Serum</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> and testosterone levels, sperm morphology, spermatogenesis kinetics and Sertoli cell number were comparable between experimental groups at both ages.

In this study, {{we tried to}} find out whether the levels of seminal FSH and LH affect the parameters of seminal fluid analysis (SFA) and if there is any correlation between levels of serum FSH and LH in healthy men and infertile patients. Materials and Methods: Levels of FSH and LH in serum and seminal plasma were assessed randomly, in addition to examination of seminal fluid analysis from 12 normozoospermic subjects (age range: 33 - 56 years) and 66 infertile patients (age range: 20 - 62 years) with duration of infertility (15 - 201 months). Macroscopic and microscopic parameters of semen specimens were determined. Data were statistically analyzed using multiple correlation and regression, and MANOVA tests. Results: Result of the present study observed significant positive correlation between FSH levels in serum and seminal plasma (r= 0. 984; p< 0. 001) of normozoospermic subjects as compared to other groups of infertile patients. No correlations were noticed between LH levels in serum and seminal plasma of normozoospermic subjects and groups of infertile patients. Significant and positive correlation was assessed between sperm concentration and levels of seminal FSH (r= 0. 822; p< 0. 05 and r= 0. 940; p< 0. 01) and seminal LH (r= 0. 989; p< 0. 001 and r= 0. 999; p< 0. 001) of asthenozoospermic and OAT patients respectively.
