40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the present article is to examine the {{implications}} of the pragmatic web for the research and development of educational technology. It is argued that, beyond knowledge acquisition and social participation, technology-mediated learning environments based on a semantic and pragmatic web have the potential for facilitating creation and advancement of knowledge. In order to capitalize on the increased information and <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> the novel ICTs, it is essential to develop adaptive informatics that co-evolves with knowledge-laden social practices. The present arguments are grounded on a vision of “Metaweb ” which is elaborated further from the perspective of social practice. Implications of the position presented concerning the research and development of technology-mediated learning environments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed online {{communication}} can enhance older adults’ <b>social</b> <b>connectivity.</b> However, {{previous studies have}} indicated two obstacles. First, older adults tend to be late adopters, or laggards. This raises the question how online communication tools can be implemented among a population that on average {{is less likely to}} adopt. Second, the effects of online communication on older adults’ <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> are debated. This thesis addresses both issues in a multi-method study of a project implementing online communication tools among the older population of three villages in the north of The Netherlands. This thesis underlines that, first, caution is in place with generic investments in, and promotion of, online communication when aiming to enhance the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> older laggards. Second, without interventions that aim to change pre-existing socio-economic structures, the implementation of online communication tools reinforces socio-economic inequality. Third, online communication tends to have a disproportional negative effect on the older “have nots” because it benefits the well connected while harming isolated older adults. Fourth, to understand the effect of online communication on older laggards’ <b>social</b> <b>connectivity,</b> a situated change perspective on adoption is required that goes beyond the identification of adoption factors. Finally, implementation and adoption mechanisms are proposed that implementers can use to stir local change...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In today’s aging world online {{communication}} is {{often viewed as}} a means to enhance <b>social</b> <b>connectivity,</b> and therefore well-being, of older adults. However, previous research on the influence of online communication on <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> largely disregards older adults, yields conflicting results and fails to assess the – debatable − causal direction of relationship. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to overcome these issues by developing four hypotheses related to who uses what, how, with whom. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a panel data study to test the hypotheses, including 302 older adults. Response rates are between 62 and 75 percent. Findings – The authors find, first, that older adults differentiate between <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> with other village members, i. e., village connectivity, and connectivity with friends. Second, the impact of online communication varies among these two types <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Where e-mail use has a negative impact on village connectivity, it Q 1 does not affect connectivity with friends. Facebook use on the other hand has a negative impact on connectivity with friends, but not on village connectivity. The negative effects were not found among those older adults that were already well-connected on forehand, indicating a buffer effect. Practical/implications – Policy makers’ implementing online communication tools to strengthen <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> older adults, may want to carefully select tools based on the type <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> they aim to enhance. Impact needs to be monitored. Originality/value – The authors contribute by analyzing how characteristics of online communication tools, i. e., information richness and privacy protection, as well as <b>social</b> <b>connectivity,</b> i. e., geographical proximity and emotional closeness jointly shape older adults’ <b>social</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Keywords - Panel data, Longitudinal data Paper type - Research pape...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, {{through the}} {{analysis}} of large amounts of real-time user-generated data {{it is possible to}} obtain new insights into the living conditions of a city and understand its transformations. Recently, such research has gained great popularity leading to a number of studies that leverage on urban data to monitor a city’s life and structure. In particular, a major finding in this field has been the discovery that many diverse socio-economic properties of cities, from personal income to gasoline consumption, follow a power law function of population size with scaling exponents that fall into distinct universality classes [4 – 8]. Analogously, similar scaling relations have been shown to hold for the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> individuals in a city [9]. Such empirical evidence has further motivated the development of several theoretical attempts to explain the observed regularities of cities [10 – 13] paving the way to a - yet to come - scientific theory of cities [14].|$|R
40|$|International audienceUser Generated Content video {{systems are}} by {{definition}} heavily {{depending on the}} input of their community of users and their social interactions for video diffusion and opinion sharing. Nevertheless, we show in this paper, through a measurement and analysis of YouKu, the most popular UGC video system in China, that the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> its users is very low. These {{results are consistent with}} what reported about YouTube in previous works. As a UGC system can benefit from audience increase through improved connectivity, our findings motivate us to propose a mean to enhance the connectivity by taking benefit of friend recommendation. To this end, we assess two similarity metrics, where users' interests are derived from their uploads and favorites tagging of videos, to evaluate the interest similarity between friends. The results consistently show that friends share to a great extent common interests. Two friend recommendation algorithms are then proposed that propose potential friends with similar interests as measured by the similarity metrics that can be derived by publicly information provided by users.

40|$|Adaptability is {{emerging}} as a key issue {{not only in the}} climate change debate but in the general area of sustainable development. In this context, we examine the link between household resilience and connectivity in a rural community in Botswana. We see resilience and vulnerability as the positive and negative dimensions of adaptability. Poor, marginal rural communities confronted with the vagaries of climate change, will need to become more resilient if they are to survive and thrive. We define resilience as the capacity of a social&# 8211;ecological system to cope with shocks such as droughts or economic crises without changing its fundamental identity. We make use of three different indices of household resilience: livelihood diversity, wealth, and a comprehensive resilience index based on a combination of human, financial, physical, social, and natural capital. Then, we measure the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> households through a whole network approach in social network analysis, using two measures of network centrality (degree centrality and betweenness). We hypothesize that households with greater <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> have greater resilience, and analyze a community in rural Botswana to uncover how different households make use of social networks to deal with shocks such as human illness and death, crop damage, and livestock disease. We surveyed the entire community of Habu using a structured questionnaire that focused on livelihood strategies and social networks. We found that gender, age of household head, and household size were positively correlated with <b>social</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Our analysis indicates that those households that are more socially networked are likely to have a wider range of livelihood strategies, greater levels of other forms of social capital, and greater overall capital. Therefore, they are more resilient...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{the daily}} problem of social {{isolation}} comes an aggravation of older adults’ general health. Social Network Services like Facebook {{have the potential}} to ameliorate the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> this segment of the population. However, they are still not fully adopted by them, whether because of age-related limitations or the lack of appropriate technological skills. In this paper we argue that the development of SNSs based on technology already used by older adults, like Television, or technology which has proven to be more accessible to them, like Tablets, can improve the ability of older adults to use these systems. We report findings from a study composed of semi-structured interviews and focus groups which aimed at the development of two Facebook-based prototypes for TV and Tablet. Results show good receptiveness from older adults to perform social tasks on TV and Tablet-based applications, for interacting using alternative modalities like speech, or back-of-device tapping, and for the use of adaptation mechanisms.

40|$|The {{sharing and}} {{dissemination}} of online content {{is one of the}} main purposes of social network applications, and the amount of content accessed through them, in particular through portable devices such as smartphones and PDAs, is expected to increase. Consumption of online content, however, does not require a continuous online presence. Content can be downloaded, consumed, modified, and uploaded at different times. An opportunity to improve a user 2 ̆ 7 s access to up-to-date information from its own social network is to take advantages of opportunistic contacts between mobile devices, without waiting for connectivity to the network infrastructure. In other words, users of a social network application may receive more fresh content with no extra infrastructure deployment, simply by communicating with mobile devices of other users, in a delay-tolerant manner. Assessing the magnitude of this improvement is, however, challenging. For example, the frequency and patterns of such contacts are partly a function <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> users, and so will be the availability of relevant information to share and more importantly the willingness to share that information.

40|$|Individual level {{response}} to natural and anthropogenic disturbance represents an increasingly important, but as yet little understood, component of animal behavior. Disturbance events often alter habitat, {{which in turn}} can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre- vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i. e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections {{may be linked to}} habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience...|$|R
40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s world, {{mobile phone}} {{penetration}} {{has reached a}} saturation point. As a result, subscriber churn has become an important issue for mobile operators as subscribers switch operators {{for a variety of}} reasons. Mobile operators typically employ churn prediction algorithms based on service usage metrics, network performance indicators, and traditional demographic information. A newly emerging technique is the use of social network analysis (SNA) to identify potential churners. Intuitively, a subscriber who is churning {{will have an impact on}} the churn propensity of his social circle. Call detail records are useful to understand the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> subscribers through call graphs but do not directly provide the strength of their relationship or have enough information to determine the diffusion of churn influence. In this paper, we present a way to address these challenges by developing a new churn prediction algorithm based on a social network analysis of the call graph. We provide a formulation that quantifies the strength of social ties between users based on multiple attributes and then apply an influence diffusion model over the call graph to determine the net accumulated influence from churners. We combine this influence and other social factors with more traditional metrics and apply machine-learning methods to compute the propensity to churn for individual users. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm over a real data set and quantify the benefit of using SNA in churn prediction...|$|R

30|$|Complex {{dynamics}} of social media {{emerge from the}} interaction between the patterns <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> users and the information exchanged along such social ties. Unveiling the underlying mechanisms that drive the evolution of online social systems requires a deep understanding of the interplay between these two aspects. Based on the case of the aNobii social network, an online service for book readers, we investigate the {{dynamics of}} link creation and the social influence phenomenon that may trigger information diffusion in the social graph. By confirming that social partner selection is strongly driven by structural, geographical, and topical proximity, we develop a machine-learning social link recommender for individual users trained on a set of features selected as best predictive out of several and we test it on the still widely unexplored domain of a network of interest. We also analyze the influence process from the two distinct perspectives of users and items. We show that link creation plays an immediate effect on the alignment of user profiles and that the established social ties are a good substrate for social influence. We quantitatively measure influence by tracking the patterns of diffusion of specific pieces of information and comparing them with appropriate null models. We discover an appreciable signal of social influence even though item consumption is a very slow process in this context. All the detected patterns of social attachment and influence are observed to be stronger when considering the social subgraph on which communication effectively occurs. Based on our study of the dynamics of the aNobii social network, we investigate the possibility to predict the evolution of such a complex social system.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{questions}} surrounding common-pool natural resources (CPRs) lies in understanding the circumstances which {{increase the likelihood of}} sustainable use and those that lead to resource degradation. Small-scale fisheries are an example of a CPR that has proven difficult to manage sustainably. I use social network analysis methods to examine the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> small-scale fishing communities and the association of network structures with collaborative behavior of small-scale fisheries in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. I found considerable <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> communities via kinship ties of small-scale fishers, both within the region and to other areas in Mexico. Fisher kinship relationships are important mechanisms for information transfer. Identifying communities in the network that are most likely to share information with other communities allows managers to develop more effective and efficient education, outreach, and enforcement efforts. Communities are also connected by their use of the same fishing zones and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). My results provide suggestions for dividing communities based on common use of fishing areas and MPAs. This may help fishers and managers to develop, implement, and enforce boundary rules that will facilitate regional management of small-scale fisheries. My results provided mixed evidence for the role of social structure in impacting positive outcomes for fisher' ability to collaborate and organize. A wide range of factors affect the emergence of institutions for CPR management. Similarly, finding a common network structure that can accurately predict sustainable use of CPRs is unlikely. Knowing how people are connected {{and the ways in which}} information about CPR resources moves through (or is hindered from moving through) a network can improve manager's ability to develop more effective strategies and actions. Adding social networks into the CPR management toolbox provides a mechanism by which those working in management and conservation can incorporate social structure into management activities.

40|$|Background and Aims Compulsive Internet Use (CIU) {{describes}} a maladaptive {{relationship with the}} Internet characterised by loss of control and conflict. Although also affecting adults, most studies use teenage samples, and theoretical development on risk factors is scarce. According to Davis (2001), the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> function <b>of</b> the Internet is key in identifying traits associated with CIU. Since Self-Concept Clarity (SCC) is strongly related to social anxiety, and virtual interactions allow “self-edition”, we hypothesized that individuals low in SCC could choose virtual interactions as safer alternative to satisfy their social needs. This could in turn {{increase the risk of}} CIU. Building on a previous study, we also expected CIU to be more harmful in the unemployed. Methods We collected samples from the UK (N[*]=[*] 532) and US (N[*]=[*] 502) with equal distribution of employed and unemployed individuals. We ran Measurement Invariance tests to confirm that the constructs were equivalent across countries. Subsequently, we conducted mediation and moderation analysis to test our hypothesis with Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results Measurement Invariance was confirmed. The relationship between SCC and CIU was partially mediated by preference of virtual interactions in both countries. This preference was significantly related to lower social support. Short term unemployment seemed to accentuate the negative impact of CIU on life satisfaction in both countries, although only marginally significantly in the US. The unemployed reported significantly lower levels of life satisfaction. Conclusion We demonstrated that SCC is a key vulnerability factor to CIU in adults, and confirmed the additional risks for the unemployed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{facing a}} disproportionate {{distribution}} {{of disease and}} health disparities, Latinos often report high levels of ethnic identity and social support provided by family cohesion, known as familismo. 1 These ties serve as protective factors to their mental health, 2 and help to maintain a cultural identity. However, these networks can also contribute to stress related health issues for Latinos. 3 Because family well-being {{is related to the}} status of the group as well as the individual health of its members, Latino individuals can feel burdened for both themselves and a collective responsibility for their family. Statement of Purpose: This {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss how Latino patients make health related decisions given their complicated family contexts, and the impact of these decisions on their everyday occupations. Methods: Two research projects provide the case studies for this paper. From the first, treatment notes for patients living with a spinal cord injury who were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention and developed a serious pressure ulcer (n= 25) were separated by ethnicity. Of 11 Latino patients, a research assistant coded the treatment notes and selected 3 individual cases based on completion of the intervention, description of family-orchestrated occupations and conflicts, and ability to produce a narrative from clinical information. The second project was interviews conducted with 10 Latina women who sought acupuncture as an alternative to western medicine as a means to treat and cope with daily stress. Interviews lasted 2 - 2. 5 hours, were transcribed verbatim, and two coders conducted a thematic analysis of the data. Though burdens were described in all interviews, 2 cases were selected for presentation. Results: The cases demonstrate how the interplay between person and context shapes occupational performance by exploring factors that are enmeshed in a Latino family’s habits, culture, environment, and routines. This tension between health as a personal responsibility and the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> the Latino family units creates situations where Latino patients are unduly burdened, and must make difficult medical decisions that lay between their individual health and the health of their family. Relationship to Occupational Science Latinos’ performances of health-related occupations are influenced by a multitude of factors related to their cultural identities and family structures. In presenting examples from these studies, we aim to take an occupational perspective of health, 4 and facilitate a discussion regarding the relationship of burden, culture, and stress, to health decision-making and occupational engagement in the Latino population.

As herd animals, horses are naturally social, and many even fear being alone. This makes horses {{a useful tool for}} COAs, as both the horse and the child seek connection with another living being. Further, horses are extremely perceptive to both external and internal conditions, and are able to pick up on the emotions of a person, whether that be excitement, fear, confidence, or other. As the horse can sense the repressed emotions within a child, they are an ideal animal to encourage and motivate COAs to connect and communicate with another living thing both physically and emotionally. This allows the child to release suppressed emotion, as well as decrease their disconnect with others. As the children begin to grow accustomed to the horses and the atmosphere, they eventually grow eager for each session, and begin to form healthy bonds and relationships with both the horse and the volunteers, something which is challenging to do, if not impossible, in a home with addiction. In summary, HHH shows what “healthy” behavior looks like so the children have a model to emulate.|$|R

We collected Bluetoothbased co-presence data from mobile phones and Facebook social data from a shared set <b>of</b> 104 <b>students.</b> For improved analysis accuracy, we created weighted social graphs based on meeting frequency and duration for co-presence data, and based on wall writing and photo tagging for Facebook data. By analyzing the overall structural properties, we show the two networks represent two different levels of social engagement which complement each other. By fusing them together, the average path length and network diameter is shortened, and consequently the <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> increases significantly. By quantifying the contribution of each social network to the fused network in terms of node degree, edge weight, and community overlap, we discovered that the co-presence network improves <b>social</b> <b>connectivity,</b> while the online network brings greater cohesiveness to social communities.

As such, sentiment information has {{become an integral part}} of social media. This thesis presents a sentiment-based approach to analyse content and social relationships in social media. First, this thesis aims to construct building blocks for sentiment analysis in social media, using sentiment in the form of mood. To that end, the problem of supervised mood classification is investigated. This line of work provides insights into what features in a generic document classification problem can be transferred to a mood classification problem in social media. As data in social media is normally large scale, novel scalable feature sets are introduced for this task. In particular, a novel set of psycholinguistic features is proposed and validated, which does not require a supervised feature selection phase and can therefore be applied for mood analysis at a large scale. Next, under an unsupervised setting, this thesis explores the new problem of pattern discovery in social media using sentiment information. The result is the discovery of intrinsic patterns of moods, each of which can be considered as a group of moods similar to a basic emotion studied in psychology, and therefore providing valuable empirical evidence about the structure of human emotion in the social media domain in a data-driven approach. The second major contribution of this thesis explores the use of sentiment information conveyed in on-line social diaries for detection of real-world events in a large scale setting. In particular, this thesis introduces the novel concept of 'sentiment burst' and employs a stochastic model for detection, and subsequent extraction, of events in social media. The resultant model is a powerful bursty detection algorithm suitable for on-line deployment on ever-growing datasets such as social media. An additional contribution in this line of work is an effective method for evaluating and ranking events using Google Timeline. This offers an objective measure by which to evaluate event detection a topic that is largely under explored in the current literature due to a general lack of human groundtruth. Next, under an egocentric analysis, sentiment information is used to study the impact of the demographics and personalities of users on the messages they create. In particular, we examine how the age and <b>social</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> on-line users correlate with the affective, topical and psycholinguistic features of the texts they author. Using a large, ground-truthed dataset of millions of users and on-line diaries, we investigate various important questions posed in social media analysis, psychology and sociology. For example, is there a difference with regard to topic, psycholinguistic features and mood in the messages written by old versus young users? What features are predictive of a user's personality? Of extraversion and introversion? Are there features that are predictive of influence? The results obtained by our sentiment-based approach are encouraging, do not require an expensive feature selection phase and thus suggest a new and promising approach for egocentric analysis in the social media domain. Finally, the sentiment information conveyed in media content is investigated with respect to the networking and interaction aspects of a social media system. Sentiment information is studied in parallel with two other common aspects of social media content: topics and linguistic styles. Sentiment information is proved in this thesis to provide additional insights into the process of community formation. It is also shown to be a powerful predictor of community membership for a message or a user at a lighter computational cost...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{studies of}} sociality in wild animals are rare, despite being {{critical}} {{for determining the}} benefits of social relationships and testing how long such relationships last and whether they change as individuals age. Knowledge about social relationships in animal species that exhibit fission-fusion dynamics can enhance {{our understanding of the}} evolution of close social bonds in humans, who also have a fission-fusion social system. We analysed the social network of wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, in Etosha National Park, Namibia, from 1102 records of group compositions, including 625 individually identified individuals, spanning 6 years. We found that giraffes, which exhibit fission-fusion sociality, formed a cohesive society with short path lengths across the network that may facilitate passive information sharing about resource availability. Male and female giraffes appeared to contribute equally to the network structure, based on similarities between the sexes for five network metrics. However, using lagged association rates, we found that long-term relationships spanning 6 years were evident among female giraffes, but not males, which may be explained by sex differences in ranging patterns and reproductive priorities. Five network metrics of females were compared between two adult age cohorts to investigate whether females 2 ̆ 7 ages influenced sociability. As younger females reached adulthood, they associated with greater numbers of females and increased their network strength and <b>social</b> <b>connectivity,</b> perhaps because <b>of</b> dispersal. Our study reinforces the value of network analysis and long-term studies for examining the social systems of wild animals. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.
