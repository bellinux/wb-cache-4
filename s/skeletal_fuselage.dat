50|$|Czerwiński {{improved}} {{the design of}} the CWJ-bis, with reduced structure weight and changes to the flying control surfaces, to improve performance and manoeuvrability. The W.W.S. 2 followed the primary trainer concept with a <b>skeletal</b> <b>fuselage</b> wire-braced to a simple fabric covered wing, supported by two struts each side, and tail unit. The completely open seating area followed the theory of the day, that called for the student pilot to feel the wind on his/her body to fully appreciate the movements of the aircraft in response to control movements and atmospheric changes, such as gusts, turbulence or thermals. One W.W.S. 2 survived the war, to fly again, and was retired to the Kraków Aviation Museum in 1950.|$|E
5000|$|The VJ 101 C {{featured}} {{an electronic}} flight control system, widely {{known as a}} 'fly-by-wire' arrangement. It was realised {{that it would be}} of critical importance to maintain controllability during the hover phase of flight, in particular the responsiveness of the engines and augmentation of the aircraft's stability. Control systems, developed by American firm Honeywell and Germany company Bodenseewerk, performed various functions across the flight regime of the VJ 101 C, including attitude control during hover and the transition from hover to horizontal aerodynamic flight. Two-channel control systems were initially used, but testing revealed the need for three-channel control systems to account for instances of hardover failures. Upon the switch to three-channel control systems, this enabled the system to be used through all flight ranges with thrust-vector control; the first such system to be developed.After the programme was no longer being pursued as a successor to the F104G Starfighter, it was retained as a development programme to explore and prove its flight control concepts. In order to test the propulsion concept, EWR produced a test rig, called the Wippe (seesaw), during early 1960. The simple device incorporated a rudimentary cockpit fixed upon a horizontal beam, which had a [...] "lift" [...] engine mounted vertically at the centre, for the purpose of performing preliminary single-axis tests of the control system. A later [...] "hover rig" [...] was assembled, which had the <b>skeletal</b> <b>fuselage</b> of the VJ 101C along with a total of three Rolls-Royce RB108 engines installed in the approximate positions that they would occupy in the final flight-capable version. The small engines each could generate a maximum of 2100 lb-f kN thrust, enough to lift the test rig. Starting in May 1961, initial testing was conducted from a telescopic column, in March 1962, the new rig conducted its first [...] "free flight" [...] successfully. Additional tests performed with a cloth [...] "skin" [...] to simulate the fuselage and wings proved to be successful as well, having demonstrated satisfactory control throughout all seasons and weather conditions.|$|E
