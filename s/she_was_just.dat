5|$|Jackson {{was offered}} a {{scholarship}} with the AIS in 1996, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 15, but her parents said no to this, as it required her to move from Albury to Canberra.

5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane).

5|$|As Lydia recovers in hospital, Zoe {{is charged}} with Sarah's murder. Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt. Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) confronts Lydia over the day of Sarah's death and is shocked when Lydia claims she was not {{supposed}} to die. Archie goes to the police, however they do not do anything. During Sarah's funeral, Archie arrives at her wake and announces Lydia caused her death. When no one believes him, he is removed. Before Zoe's court case, Mike goes to visit her. Lydia tries to tell Mike that she will try to appear innocent. When he returns, and claims he knows she could not have killed Sarah, Lydia manipulates him into believing that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to get him on side. At this time, Charlotte and Lydia get back together. At the court case, Lydia lies whilst giving a statement. Charlotte accompanies Lydia to the case, agreeing to keep their new relationship quiet.

5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

25|$|As the Minnie A.

Takeda eventually ends their dating relationship and tells Yuma to find out what she wants for herself before they go any further. The two remain friends until he starts to worry that Yuma may be in trouble with another person at Fujiwara's suggestion. He asks Yuma (who is crying) out again {{at the end of the}} fifth manga volume not knowing that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> rejected by Hotaru.|$|E
25|$|Halep won {{her first}} ever WTA Finals match, beating fellow Finals debutante Eugenie Bouchard in {{straight}} sets. On 22 October 2014, Halep stunned two-time defending champion Serena Williams. Williams's two games won equaled her career worst; {{the last time}} Williams managed to win just two games in a WTA Tour or Grand Slam match was in 1998 when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 16 years old. Halep could have eliminated Williams from the tournament had she lost her final round-robin match to Ana Ivanovic in straight sets; however, Halep chose to play to win the match and ended up losing in three sets. Despite the defeat, Halep won her group and secured an appearance in the semifinals. She advanced to the final by beating Agnieszka Radwańska in straight sets. In the final match, she once again faced Williams, but this time lost in straight sets.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{achievements}} of the Duke's premiership was {{the arrangement of the}} King's marriage. The King had been betrothed to Mariana Victoria, the infanta of Spain, daughter of the Spanish king, in 1721, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> three years old, and the French king only eleven. By 1724, the king was fourteen but the infanta was still a decade away from child-bearing age. Some felt that this was too long for France to wait for an heir. This was especially so because, if Louis XV died without an heir, it was feared that, armed with a hereditary right he had renounced when he became king of Spain, Philip V de Bourbon would ignore the Treaty of Utrecht and claim the French throne, thus plunging France and Spain into conflict with the other European powers.|$|E
25|$|Harriet Powers, a slave-born African American woman, {{made two}} famous story quilts. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{one of the}} many African-American quilters who contributed to the {{evolution}} of quilting. The first nationwide recognition of African-American quiltmaking came when the Gee's Bend quilting community was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and travelled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee's Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quiltmaking tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and others quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. The communal nature of the quilting process (and how it can bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps.|$|E

Jenny {{fell in love with her}} boss, Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins) and later briefly dated Declan Kennedy (Kevin J. Wilson).

Jenny began to be stalked by a boy named Adam (Jeremy Brennan) who claimed to be her real biological son, though it was never disproven, he was later sectioned due to his deteriorating mental health.|$|E
