25|$|Reinhart {{has been}} {{recently}} lauded for her <b>scatting</b> techniques reminiscent of Fitzgerald, {{as well as}} for her yodeling. Her frequent call and response sessions during her live performances have also received particular praise. Reinhart's early vocal training came from her mother, and she has never been trained professionally. Growing up, she learned her <b>scatting</b> and call-and-response techniques from her father, who would scat and then make her repeat the sounds back to him.|$|E
25|$|Scat singing {{can allow}} jazz singers {{to have the}} same improvisational {{opportunities}} as jazz instrumentalists: <b>scatting</b> can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about destroying the lyric. Especially when bebop was developing, singers found scat to {{be the best way to}} adequately engage in the performance of jazz.|$|E

40|$|Collection of <b>scat</b> samples {{is common}} in {{wildlife}} research, particularly for genetic capturemark- recapture applications. Due to high degradation rates of genetic material in <b>scat,</b> large numbers of samples must be collected to generate robust estimates. Optimization of sampling approaches to account for taxa-specific patterns of <b>scat</b> deposition is, therefore, necessary to ensure sufficient sample collection. While <b>scat</b> collection methods have been widely studied in carnivores, research to maximize <b>scat</b> collection and noninvasive sampling efficiency for social ungulates is lacking. Further, environmental factors or <b>scat</b> morphology may influence detection of <b>scat</b> by observers. We contrasted performance of novel radial search protocols with existing adaptive cluster sampling protocols to quantify differences in observed amounts of wild pig (Sus scrofa) <b>scat.</b> We also evaluated the effects of environmental (percentage of vegetative ground cover and occurrence of rain immediately prior to sampling) and <b>scat</b> characteristics (fecal pellet size and number) on the detectability of <b>scat</b> by observers. We found that 15 - and 20 -m radial search protocols resulted in greater numbers of <b>scats</b> encountered than the previously used adaptive cluster sampling approach across habitat types, and that fecal pellet size, number of fecal pellets, percent vegetative ground cover, and recent rain events were significant predictors of <b>scat</b> detection. Our results suggest that use of a fixed-width radial search protocol may {{increase the number of}} <b>scats</b> detected for wild pigs, or other social ungulates, allowing more robust estimation of population metrics using noninvasive genetic sampling methods. Further, as fecal pellet size affected <b>scat</b> detection, juvenile or smaller-sized animals may be less detectable than adult or large animals, which could introduce bias into abundance estimates. Knowledge of relationships between environmental variables and <b>scat</b> detection may allow researchers to optimize sampling protocols to maximize utility of noninvasive sampling for wild pigs and other social ungulates...|$|R

25|$|Vaughan's final {{complete}} {{album was}} Brazilian Romance, produced and composed by Sérgio Mendes and recorded {{primarily in the}} early part of 1987 in New York and Detroit. In 1988, Vaughan contributed vocals to an album of Christmas carols recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with the Utah Symphony Orchestra and sold in Hallmark Cards stores. In 1989, Quincy Jones' album Back on the Block featured Vaughan in a brief <b>scatting</b> duet with Ella Fitzgerald. This was Vaughan's final studio recording and, fittingly, it was Vaughan's only formal studio recording with Fitzgerald in a career that had begun 46 years earlier opening for Fitzgerald at the Apollo.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of the Studio Uno live Saturday night series showcased Mina's new blond look with shaved eyebrows. The shows {{included}} the brooding songs [...] "Un bacio è troppo poco" [...] ("One Kiss is Not Enough") and [...] "Un anno d'amore" [...] ("A Year of Love"), a cover of Nino Ferrer's [...] "C'est irreparable". In the same series she performed [...] "Brava" [...] ("Good"), a rhythmic jazz number specially written by Bruno Canfora to demonstrate the Mina's vocal range and performing skills. Her Studio Uno album topped the Italian chart that year. Her recordings of 1965 included the <b>scatting</b> performance of [...] "Spirale Waltz", the theme song for the film The 10th Victim.|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was <b>scatting</b> at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E
40|$|Establishing species {{distribution}} and population trends are basic requirements in conservation biology, yet acquiring this fundamental information is often difficult. Indirect survey methods {{that rely on}} fecal pellets (<b>scats)</b> can overcome some difficulties but present their own challenges. In particular, variation in <b>scat</b> detectability and decay rate can introduce biases. We studied how vegetation communities affect the detectability and decay rate of <b>scats</b> as exemplified by koalas Phascolarctos cinereus: <b>scat</b> detectability was highly and consistently dependent on ground layer complexity (introducing up to 16 % non-detection bias); <b>scat</b> decay rates were highly heterogeneous within vegetation communities; exposure of <b>scats</b> to surface water and rain strongly accelerated <b>scat</b> decay rate and finally, invertebrates were found to accelerate <b>scat</b> decay rate markedly, but unpredictably. This last phenomenon may explain the high variability of <b>scat</b> decay rate within a single vegetation community. Methods to decrease biases should be evaluated when planning <b>scat</b> surveys, as the most appropriate method(s) will vary depending on species, scale of survey and landscape characteristics. Detectability and decay biases are both stronger in certain vegetation communities, thus their combined effect is likely to introduce substantial errors in <b>scat</b> surveys and this could result in inappropriate and counterproductive management decisions...|$|R

500|$|Among {{more recent}} commentators, Alan Pollack admires [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as [...] "such a good {{illustration}} of two compositional lessons – {{how to fill}} a large canvas with simple means, {{and how to use}} diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast." [...] Pollack considers that the song's long coda provides [...] "an astonishingly transcendental effect", while AllMusic's Richie Unterberger similarly opines: [...] "What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense <b>scatting</b> ever heard in rock …" [...] In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald wrote that the [...] "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a blemish" [...] but he praised the song as [...] "a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms". MacDonald concluded: [...] "'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired." [...] Lennon said the song was [...] "one of [...] masterpieces".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of contemporary reviews on [...] "Baila Esta Cumbia" [...] were positive. Billboard contributor Ramiro Burr praised the song for its [...] "melodic hook". Burr, {{who wrote in}} The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music (1999), opined that Selena [...] "evolved a rhythmic style" [...] which paved way for [...] "catchy cumbias", giving [...] "Baila Esta Cumbia" [...] as his example of her [...] "increasing prowess". Italian essayist Gaetano Prampolini, called [...] "Baila Esta Cumbia" [...] a [...] "plain cumbia dance pleasure" [...] in his book The Shade of the Saguaro. In a 2013 contribution to OC Weekly, Marco Torres added that [...] "Baila Esta Cumbia" [...] is a [...] "fun song" [...] and noted its [...] "lively" [...] addictive nature. John Storm Roberts wrote in his book The Latin Tinge, that the recording is an [...] "up-tempo romantic piece" [...] for his review of Selena's live album, Live (1993). Roberts added that with [...] "Como la Flor", the two [...] "mixes pop vocalism, some quite free <b>scatting,</b> and a classic banda keyboard sound." [...] Federico Martinez of the San Antonio La Prensa called the recording [...] "upbeat".|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{recorded}} all the tracks, as {{they were}} after Belew had performed on them, in a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. The lyricist used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes {{in the style of}} Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded <b>scatting</b> until convinced that he was no longer [...] "hearing nonsense". After the frontman was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were followed by the overdubbing process. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had been working on parts of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

30|$|<b>Scat</b> from leopard cats was {{differentiated}} from <b>scat</b> {{of other}} small carnivores {{in terms of}} the shape and size and/or the presence of species-specific tracks (Grassman et al. 2005). An average diameter of 1  cm for the <b>scat</b> of the leopard cat was used as a reference. Assuming that cannibalism did not occur (Grassman et al. 2005), another criterion for identifying leopard cat <b>scat</b> was the presence of hair ingested while auto-grooming. The diet of leopard cats was investigated via analysis of their <b>scat.</b> <b>Scat</b> was collected from Samcheok in 2006, Goheung in 2011, and Gwangju in 2011 in Korea (Table  1). The <b>scat</b> was placed in a fine mesh nylon stocking and washed to separate the contents. The contents were then sun-dried and stored in 70 % alcohol.|$|R

500|$|Musically, Title {{comprises}} throwback style sound, 1950s doo wop-inspired {{songs that}} straddle {{the line between}} modern R and melodic pop. The EP's opening track, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop song {{which serves as a}} throwback to 1950s and 1960s music, and contains elements from a complex mix of several genres; R, hip hop, tropical, country and rock and roll. Sonically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] comprises an earworm hook, early 1960s soul-pop groove, <b>scatting</b> tempo and shimmying melody. Lyrically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] serves as a callout to embrace one's appearance and promote a positive body image. The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman's bottom. Larger women are described as [...] "bass" [...] and thinner women as [...] "treble", which Trainor implies as a joke about [...] "thick and thin". The lyric [...] "I'm bringing booty back" [...] references Justin Timberlake's [...] "SexyBack" [...] (2006). In the song, she also calls out the fashion industry for creating unreachable standards of beauty: [...] "I see the magazines working that Photoshop / We know that shit ain't real, c'mon make it stop / You know I won't be no stick-figure Barbie doll." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bands such as The Boswell Sisters {{regularly}} employed <b>scatting</b> {{on their}} records, including the high complexity of <b>scatting</b> {{at the same}} time, in harmony. An example is their version of [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". Another famous scat singer is Scatman Crothers, who {{would go on to}} movie and television fame. British dance band trumpeter and vocalist Nat Gonella was a notable scat singer. Some authorities considered scat singing as lacking respectability, including BBC Radio, which did not permit <b>scatting</b> on air in the late 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Humor {{is another}} {{important}} element of scat singing. Cab Calloway exemplified the use of humorous <b>scatting.</b> Other examples of humorous <b>scatting</b> include Slim Gaillard, Leo Watson, and Bam Brown's 1945 [...] "Avocado Seed Soup Symphony", in which the singers scat variations on the word [...] "avocado" [...] {{for much of the}} recording. In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of musical quotation. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his <b>scatting.</b> This is called using a compression. The 1958 song [...] "Witch Doctor" [...] by Ross Bagdasarian Sr., creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks, employs the technique of humorous <b>scatting</b> in its chorus of nonsense syllables (oo ee oo ah ah).|$|E

40|$|A {{two year}} study of dung beetles and ants acting on <b>scats</b> of {{two species of}} opossum (Didelphis spp.) was carried out. <b>Scats</b> were left {{in the field in}} order to detect post-dispersal agents. A portion of each <b>scat</b> (30 %) was {{examined}} for seeds in the laboratory. Beetles were recovered from burrows (51 % of 84 faecal samples left in the field) where they either buried <b>scats</b> of opossums or were attracted, together with ants, to pitfalls (N= 10) baited with opossum <b>scats.</b> Dung beetles were the main post-dispersal agents of seeds found in <b>scats</b> of opossums, rolling the <b>scats</b> away or burying then on the site of deposition. They buried faeces at 4 to 15 cm in depth (N= 22 tunnels). The main dung beetles identified (medium to large size) were Eurysternus (28. 7 % in pitfalls) and Dichotomius (13. 7 %), Coprophanaeus (seen only directly on faeces), besides small-bodied beetles (< 10 mm; 57. 6 %). The ant Acromirmex sp. transported some seeds from <b>scats.</b> This species was present in 25. 5 % of all Formicidae samples (pitfall). These post-dispersal agents contribute to avert <b>scat</b> seed predators such as rodents, and to accelerate seed bank formation...|$|R
2500|$|Elvis Presley added <b>scatting</b> {{in some of}} {{his songs}} {{recorded}} in the 1950s and again in the '70s. The Youtube clip [...] "Elvis Presley, [...] "Patch It Up", Take 9, Youtube Jul 31, 2010" [...] offers an example of Elvis' growl-scat technique in this studio rendition of the rock-style love-song [...] "We Can Patch It Up, Baby".

2500|$|<b>Scatting</b> may be {{desirable}} {{because it does}} not [...] "taint the music with the impurity of denotation". Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and [...] "d what it mean". Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words. Music critic Will Friedwald has written that Louis Armstrong's <b>scatting,</b> for example, [...] "has tapped into his own core of emotion", releasing emotions [...] "so deep, so real" [...] that they are unspeakable; his words [...] "bypass our ears and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls".|$|E

40|$|The rock-dwelling macropod {{species of}} the tropics of the Northern Territory, Australia, are behaviourally elusive and {{difficult}} to observe in their rugged habitats. Hence, little is understood about their ecology. We evaluated the potential of using <b>scats</b> (faecal pellets) as a survey tool for this faunal assemblage by: (1) developing {{a key to the}} <b>scats</b> of the species; (2) examining the rates of loss and decomposition of short-eared rock-wallaby (Petrogale brachyotis) <b>scats</b> in these tropical environments; and (3) comparing the distribution of <b>scats</b> of P. brachyotis with the species 2 ̆ 7 use of space and habitats as determined with radio-telemetry. Classification tree modelling discriminated the <b>scats</b> of the seven macropod species, primarily on the basis of width. The reliability of identification was greatly improved with larger sample sizes and inclusion of a habitat parameter. Rates of <b>scat</b> loss and decay were variable and the greatest losses occurred in the wet season, particularly on sandy soils. <b>Scat</b> censuses underestimated the total area used by P. brachyotis but the distribution of <b>scats</b> showed the same broad pattern of habitat use found by radio-telemetry. We conclude that <b>scats</b> can accurately indicate the presence and habitat preferences of rock-dwelling macropod species...|$|R

Macropod remains were the most common food item in dingo <b>scats,</b> followed by rabbits and birds. Dingo <b>scats</b> did not contain small mammal remains, and infrequently contained arthropod and reptile remains. Cat and dingo <b>scats</b> contained remains from 11 and six mammal species, respectively. Of the small mammals, cat <b>scats</b> contained rodent remains more frequently than those of dasyurids.

40|$|Bear food {{habits are}} often {{quantified}} using <b>scat</b> analysis, mainly {{due to its}} non-invasiveness and because samples are relatively easy to collect. However, lab processing time can be daunting and may end up competing with other field activities. Sub-sampling a bear <b>scat</b> to analyze its contents may reduce the lab processing time, {{but the number of}} subsamples per <b>scat</b> is usually chosen arbitrarily. We investigated the effect of the number of subsamples per bear <b>scat</b> on the estimatation of the diet composition of the Apennine brown bear in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park. Based on a sample of 328 bear <b>scats</b> collected in 2006, and from 5 to 1 subsamples (10 ml) per <b>scat,</b> dietary analysis showed qualitative and quantitative stability at a decreasing number of subsamples, and only food items of negligible importance were occasionally missed using 1 - 2 subsamples per <b>scat.</b> We concluded that 2 subsamples can be used without significant loss in accuracy, corresponding to a 60 % reduction in lab time, and to more than 50 days of lab work for one operator to process our entire bear <b>scat</b> sample.
