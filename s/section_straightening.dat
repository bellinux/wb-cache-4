40|$|Using Langevin {{dynamics}} simulations, conformational, {{mechanical and}} dynamical properties of charged polymers threading through a nanopore are investigated. The shape descriptors display different variation behaviors for the cis- and trans-side sub-chains, which reflects a strong cis-trans dynamical asymmetry, {{especially when the}} driving field is strong. The calculation of bond stretching shows how the bond tension propagates on the chain backbone, and the chain <b>section</b> <b>straightened</b> by the tension force {{is determined by the}} ratio of the direct to the contour distances of the monomer to the pore. With the study of the waiting time function, the threading process is divided into the tension-propagation stage and the tail-retraction stage. At the end, the drift velocity, diffusive property and probability density distribution are explored. Owing to the non-equilibrium nature, translocation is not a simple drift-diffusion process, but exhibits several intermediate behaviors, such as ballistic motion, normal diffusion and super diffusion, before ending with the last, negative-diffusion behavior...|$|R

50|$|Attached to the {{northeast}} is the remnant of an old formation that intrudes into Rabbi Levi, producing a <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> of rim along that face. This unnamed formation has been almost completely obliterated, and is overlain in the northwest by Lindenau, and along the outer northeast side by Rothmann.|$|R
50|$|The <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> of the Yellow River in Starke County, {{which had}} {{historically}} been a swampy and winding stream with numerous oxbow lakes, {{was the subject}} of a 2004 effort by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to address excess accumulation of sediment in the river's streambed as a result of channelization.|$|R
50|$|Scaliger is a {{prominent}} lunar impact crater that {{is located in}} the southern hemisphere {{on the far side of}} the Moon. It is attached to the northwest rim of the walled plain Milne, and the shared perimeter has reshaped the outer wall of Scaliger slightly, producing a <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> along the southeast. To the west of Scaliger is the Lacus Solitudinis.|$|R
50|$|The Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel {{connects the}} Delta to the Port of Sacramento, with its {{terminus}} located near Rio Vista, on the northwestern {{side of the}} Delta.

50|$|In 1664 an Act of Parliament {{authorised}} {{the conversion}} of the River Avon into a navigation between Salisbury and the English Channel at Christchurch. Canalised channels were dug to <b>straighten</b> <b>sections</b> of the river, including one about a 1 mi long through Britford parish. The river had ceased to be navigable by 1737 but bridges over it and remains of locks still survive around Britford.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the early}} 1900s into the 1980s the Brewery Flats {{section of the}} creek south of Lewistown {{was the site of}} various {{industrial}} activities including a rail yard, coal mine, oil refinery, feedlot and a brewery. The meanders of Big Spring Creek in the <b>section</b> were <b>straightened</b> and channelized into a ditch that diverted the creek away from the developments. In 1985 the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks acquired 23 acre of the Brewery Flats section to establish a fishing access site. Although nature had begun to reclaim the developed land with cattail marshes, cottonwood groves, and willow thickets, natural reclamation was impeded by the creek's channelization which eliminated annual flooding and siltation that fosters stream health.|$|R
50|$|US 80 {{has existed}} since 1928, from Vicksburg and through Meridian. It was paved in {{numerous}} sections, including the section in Warren County. That <b>section</b> was <b>straightened</b> out in 1934. By 1960, I-20 was being constructed, and intersected US 80 east of Vicksburg. Four years later, I-20 was extended, connecting to US 80 {{just west of}} the Warren-Hinds county line. An interchange was built there by 1967. US 80 realigned south of the interchange, and no longer intersected I-20 near Bovina a few years later. Twenty-four years later, in 1998, US 80 in Warren County was realigned onto I-20, and the alignment between Vicksburg and Bovina became MS 822. No significant changes have been made to the route since.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{problems}} faced include {{the age of the}} line; it was constructed in the mid-1900s and contained many curves, often in difficult terrain. Services were slow and speeds severely restricted. The modernisation has involved rebuilding entire <b>sections</b> of track, <b>straightening</b> many curvy segments by rerouting portions of the track and renewing the rails, leading to higher operational speeds. Electrification of the line is not scheduled for the near future.|$|R

500|$|Despite being {{moderately}} polluted, {{the creek}} {{is one of}} the best salmon-producing tributaries of the Rogue River. Coho and Chinook salmon migrate upstream each year; however, several dams hinder their progress. A fish ladder was built in 2005 to help fish swim past a dam constructed in Eagle Point in the 1880s, but was destroyed by flooding just three months later. It was rebuilt in 2008. Restoration of a [...] artificially <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> of the creek in the Denman Wildlife Area was completed in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Downstream {{from the}} forks, the river flows through {{a wooded area}} known as Crothers' Woods which is {{designated}} as an Environmentally Sensitive Area due to the high quality beech-maple forest that grows on the ravine slopes. South of Pottery Road it enters a more degraded section and ends up in a <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> that includes cement and steel dock wall, a remnant from an earlier industrial era. The river flows from there into the Keating Channel at Lake Shore Boulevard East {{which is at the}} north east corner of the Toronto Harbour.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, local {{resident}} and conservationist Terry Hershey, working with local congressman George H.W. Bush, prevented {{the federal government}} from lining the <b>straightened</b> <b>sections</b> of the bayou with concrete. In 1966, Hershey {{and a number of}} other homeowners in the Memorial area formed the Buffalo Bayou Preservation Association, which later expanded its mission and became the Bayou Preservation Association. In 1989, Terry Hershey Park, which runs parallel to the bayou between Beltway 8 and Highway 6, was dedicated to her efforts. The bayou is one of the only bayous in Houston to retain its natural riparian ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|Bridges {{were also}} {{required}} in close succession west of Goole: {{one over the}} L&YR line into the docks 80 ft; the Knottingley and Goole Canal, crossed by an iron trellis girder of around 128 ft; and the Dutch River, with two iron trellis girders of 90 ft. On {{the southern part of}} the line, west of Thorne, bridges were required over the Stainforth and Keadby canal, and the Thorne-Selby road. Stations were built at Laxton (Saltmarshe station), a new through station at Goole, and a second station at Thorne (Thorne North station). Construction of the Hull-Thorne <b>section,</b> and <b>straightening</b> of the Doncaster-Thorne Line had begun by 1864; work on the SYR's line was continued through 1865, with the line (Sandall to Maude's Bridge) opened 10 November 1866. Work on the Thorne-Doncaster section continued through 1866 and 1867, with the line nearly completed in 1868 and the Skelton viaduct over the Ouse complete enough by February 1868 to allow officials of the NER to pass over it in a train.|$|R
5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57.

50|$|After {{the deep}} {{conditioner}} is fully rinsed out, a leave in conditioner is applied and hair {{is set on}} large magnetic rollers and placed under a hood dryer for up to 2 hours, depending on the length and density of the hair. Rollers are used to begin the straightening process and also create body and movement in the straightened style. Once the rollers are removed, concentrated silicone-based serums are applied to the hair. Oil-based products are typically avoided at this stage as they add weight and greasiness and can burn on the hair. Next, hair is blowdried straight in small sections at high heat, using a round brush to create tension and volume. A concentrator nozzle {{is attached to the}} end of the blowdryer to allow heat to be directed on the <b>section</b> being <b>straightened.</b> After blowdrying, a small amount of serum is applied and hair is wrapped in a dubi or doobie, a method which wraps and pins the hair around the head, using it as a giant roller, to create additional straightening and movement. Finally, hair is taken down from the dubi and styled as desired.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the mechanical behavior of precise straightening thin-walled members systematically. As {{a result of}} its cross section characteristics of the thin-walled members, traditional straightening theory does not work well in the straightening process of this kind of metal bar stock. Considering the stress evolvement of <b>section</b> during the <b>straightening</b> process, a model was built to analysis the straightening process like thin-walled member with great section height. By making a thorough analysis of the <b>straightening</b> process, the <b>section</b> deformation law and the relationship between sectional distortion and straightening parameters has been mastered. An analytical model was built for macroscopic energetics parameters of the straightening process and the parameters was optimized based on this model. Then loading mode of thin-walled member straightening was discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Broadway, {{which was}} the main north-south artery of the colonial city, {{originally}} ended at 10th Street, where it merged with the Bloomingdale Road, which then wandered up to approximately 147th Street, where it turned into the Kingsbridge Road. The combined streets took a fairly haphazard path {{as they made their}} way uptown. The Commissioners' Plan retained Broadway and Bloomingdale Road up to 23rd Street, with the intention that the uptown sections would be demapped. However, Bloomingdale Road as far as 42rd Street was officially restored in 1838, up to 71st Street in 1847, then in 1851 to 86th Street, with each <b>section</b> being <b>straightened,</b> often in parallel to the grid, as it was restored. [...] In 1865, it was restored all the way to Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the top of Manhattan. The section below 59th Street was called Broadway, but Andrew Haswell Green called the section from 59th to 108th Street [...] "The Boulevard". Finally in 1899, the entire road was named Broadway, and the other names, not only Bloomingdale Road, The Boulevard, and Kingsbridge Road, but also Middle Road, Old Harlem Road and the East Post Road all disappeared. In modern New York City, Broadway, along with the avenues and the major cross-streets, is considered to be one of the major arterial roads.|$|R

50|$|The {{road was}} {{improved}} from Barnwell {{turn to a}} new roundabout northeast of Oundle as the Oundle Bypass. This used the alignment of the former BR Northampton to Peterborough railway and crosses the River Nene twice in quick succession. The road was opened on 12 December 1985 by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester and is commemorated by a plinth and brass plaque at the roundabout. A minor alignment change took place beyond here through the hamlet of Elmington. Beyond Elmington a curve was eased as the road {{climbed out of the}} valley and a new <b>straightened</b> <b>section</b> was constructed to a new roundabout for Warmington.

50|$|In 1879, {{what became}} known as the Spring Creek Band of Métis {{migrated}} into the Judith Basin from the Milk River region north of the Missouri River to hunt buffalo in the area. The extended families of Pierre Berger (1879) and Francis Janeaux (1880) established a settlement on Big Spring Creek where the Carroll Trail (a freight road from a steamboat landing on the Missouri River to Helena, Montana) crossed the creek. The site became the town of Lewistown, Montana which was formally established in 1883.As the town of Lewistown grew, the creek, especially sections south of town began to degrade through water diversions for irrigation and power as well as some channelization to <b>straighten</b> <b>sections</b> to reclaim land and mitigate the effects of annual spring flooding. Progressive-minded settlers modified the meandering creek in favor of transportation and agriculture efficiency. Irrigation ditches were dug as early as 1884. By 1886 water was being diverted to power a flour mill. Around 1910, a section the creek was straightened to create a switching yard for the Milwaukee Road, an area that eventually became known as Brewery Flats. By 1922 Lewistown authorities had tunneled the creek through an 840-foot long concrete conduit beneath the central business district.|$|R
