The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

It was the first steam-powered commercial flour mill in the United Kingdom. James Watt, an associate of Boulton, was personally hired to build a steam engine for the mill to grind corn. Watt's engine was tested before numerous spectators, including Sir Joseph Banks, but encountered problems with the <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> and the piston rods. Repairs were completed in April 1786. The cost of erecting the mill proved to be considerably in excess of the original estimate, and Watt soon feared that it {{would turn out to be}} a losing concern. He had no doubt that the engines or the machinery would be able to do all that had been promised; but he feared that the absence of business capacity on the part of the managers would be fatal to the mill's commercial success. In September 1786, the Duke of Milan visited the mills.|$|E
2500|$|One of Murdoch's most {{significant}} inventions, for which evidence exists to attribute it to him, was the <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> which allowed steam {{power to be}} used to [...] "produce a continued Rotative or Circular Motion round an Axis or Centre, and thereby to give Motion to the Wheels of Mills or other Machines". This gear converted the vertical motion of a beam, driven by a steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed {{at the end of a}} rod connected to the beam of the engine. With the motion of the beam this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun' a second rotating cog fixed to and which turned the drive shaft. This system of achieving rotary motion was patented in his own name by James Watt in October 1781 although Samuel Smiles, biographer of Boulton and Watt, attributes this to Murdoch and there also exists a drawing of the sun and planet system in Murdoch's hand dated August 1781. Other evidence attributing this invention to William Murdoch takes the form of a letter from Boulton to a colleague concerning Watt's forthcoming October patents in which he writes: ...|$|E

A practical differential planetary gear train, which combines two inputs and one output, is studied using multi-body dynamics software. Backlash between the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are precisely specified to avoid teeth interference and undercut.

Torsional vibration induced by backlash and tooth geometry errors is shown to cause teeth separation and doublesided impacts in unloaded and lightly loaded gearing drives.

Time domain results show that the dynamic responses due to the combination of backlash and tooth defects depend on the interaction of many components of the differential planetary system...|$|R
40|$|A Planetary gear can {{transmit}} high torque ratio stably and, therefore, the gear {{is widely used}} in industrial applications, i. e., wind turbines, automobiles, helicopters. Unexpected failure of the planetary gear results in substantial economic loss and human casualties. Extensive efforts {{have been made to}} develop the fault diagnostic techniques of gears; however, the techniques are mostly concerned about spur gears. This is mainly because understanding of complex dynamic behaviors of a planetary gear is lacking, such as multiple gear contacts, non-stationary axis of rotation, etc. This study thus proposes model-based fault diagnostics for a planetary gear that is based upon its dynamic analysis. Instead of vibration signals, this study uses transmission error (TE) signals for fault diagnostics of the planetary gear because TE signals (a) are directly related to the dynamic behaviors of gear mesh stiffness and (b) increase as damages on a gear mesh reduce the gear mesh stiffness. A lumped parameter model was used for modeling dynamic behaviors of the planetary gear. For more precise modeling, mesh phase difference–between <b>sun,</b> ring, <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> – <b>and</b> contact ratio were taken into account in the lumped parameter model. After acquiring transmission error signals from the model, order analysis and data processing were executed to generate health related data for the planetary gear. Consequently, it is concluded that the use of transmission error signals helps gain understanding of complex dynamic behaviors of the planetary gear and diagnose its potential faults. 1...|$|R

40|$|Comparing with {{fixed shaft}} gearbox, {{vibration}} properties {{of planetary gearbox}} are much more complicated. In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources as several pairs of sun-planet gears and several pairs of ring-planet gears mesh simultaneously. In addition, the signal transmission path changes due to {{the rotation of the}} carrier. To facilitate fault detection of a planetary gearbox and avoid catastrophic consequences caused by gear failures, it is essential to understand the vibration properties of a planetary gearbox. This paper aims to simulate vibration signals and investigate vibration properties of a planetary gear set when there is a cracked tooth in a <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> Displacement signals of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> the <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>and</b> resultant acceleration signals of the whole planetary gear set will be simulated and investigated.

40|$|Sidebands of {{vibration}} spectrum {{are sensitive}} to the fault degree and have been proved to be useful for tooth fault detection and localization. However, the amplitude and frequency modulation due to manufacturing errors (which are inevitable in actual planetary gear system) lead to much more complex sidebands. Thus, in the paper, a lumped parameter model for a typical planetary gear system with various types of errors is established. In the model, the influences of tooth faults on time-varying mesh stiffness and tooth impact force are derived analytically. Numerical methods are then utilized to obtain the response spectra of the system with tooth faults with and without errors. Three system components (including <b>sun,</b> <b>planet,</b> <b>and</b> ring <b>gears)</b> with tooth faults are considered in the discussion, respectively. Through detailed comparisons of spectral sidebands, fault characteristic frequencies of the system are acquired. Dynamic experiments on a planetary gear-box test rig are carried out to verify the simulation results and these results are of great significances for the detection and localization of tooth faults in wind turbines...|$|R
40|$|Planetary gearbox {{torsional}} vibration signals are {{free from the}} extra amplitude modulation effect due to time-varying transmission paths and have simpler frequency structure than translational ones. Gear faults result in modulation on the torsional resonance vibration and are manifested by the modulation feature. These merits are exploited for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis in this paper. Gear fault induced {{torsional vibration}}s in resonance region are modelled as amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) processes, the explicit equation of Fourier spectrum is derived, and the sideband characteristics are summarized. To avoid complex sideband analysis, amplitude and frequency demodulation analysis methods are exploited. The equations of amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra are derived in closed form, and their frequency structures are revealed. For fault diagnosis based on above theoretical derivations, a resonance frequency identification approach is proposed through time-frequency analysis of torsional vibrations during variable speed processes, according to the independence nature of resonance frequency on running conditions. The theoretical derivations and proposed approach are illustrated by numerical simulated signal analysis and are further validated through dynamics modelling and lab experimental tests.

50|$|The <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> is {{a simple}} {{epicyclic}} gear. The planet is attached rigidly {{to the end of}} the connecting rod, hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.|$|E

An objective function is formulated to represent the total stress in the system by combining the maximum fillet stresses in each component. A sequential procedure is then used to minimize the objective function subject to equality, inequality and integer function constraints. The finite element method is used to evaluate the stresses in the gear teeth and iterative application of the analysis and optimization stages converges to produce a design vector such that the maximum stress produced in all components of the system is minimized. Since the effectiveness of each design is assessed using the finite element method, the factorized stiffness matrix is reused to calculate the design derivatives.

40|$|The {{epicycle}} gearbox or {{planetary gearbox}} (PG) {{is a central}} power transmission systems of important machines such as helicopters and wind turbines which are mission critical and high cost systems. Condition monitoring (CM) has been explored extensively {{in recent years to}} avoid any unexpected interruptions and severe accidences caused by faults PGs. Although, considerable advancements in CM techniques, there still existed significant deficiency such as insensitivity, false diagnosis and high costs in implementing such techniques in industries. To improve CM techniques, therefore, this thesis focuses on an investigation of advanced signal analysis techniques such as higher order spectra (HOS) in order to achieve full characterisation of the nonlinear modulation processes of PG dynamics and thereby develop accurate diagnostic techniques. The lumped mass model is established for modelling the dynamic behaviour of the PG under investigation, which allows the vibration behaviours to be understood for analysing different abnormalities such as tooth breakages and gear errors. This paves the way for subsequent data analytics and fault diagnostics using modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) that allows the vibration data to be examined through HOS, but it is significantly efficient in characterising the multiple and nonlinear modulations of PG dynamics alongside superior noise reduction performance. Different degrees of misalignments in the PG drive system has been investigated and successfully diagnosed using MSB analysis of vibration measurements [...] Moreover, the investigation included detection of tooth breakage faults of different severities in both the <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> a <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> The tooth faults were diagnosed using the recently developed MSB through accurately representation and estimate of residual sidebands induced by these faults. Consequently, MSB analysis produces an accurate and reliable diagnosis in that it gives correct indication of the fault severity and location for wide operating conditions. Furthermore, these fault diagnosis practices allows the establishment of residual sideband analysis approach. These residual sidebands resulting from the out-of-phase superposition of vibration waves due to asymmetric, multiple meshing sources are much less influenced by gear errors than the in-phase sidebands due to faults or new occurrences of the symmetricity. MSB can provide an accurate characterisation of the residual sidebands and consequently produces consistent diagnosis as confirmed by both simulation and experiment...|$|R
