Under such circumstance, these adjacent cracks could {{interact with each}} other. Moreover, the <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure,</b> produced by the high water pressure, can change cracks’ status and {{have an impact on}} the stress state of fragile rocks. According to the theory of fracture mechanics, this paper discusses the law of crack initiation and the evolution law of stress intensity factor at the tip of a wing crack caused by compression-shear stress and <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure.</b> Subsequently, considering the interaction of the wing cracks and the additional stress caused by rock bridge damage, this paper proposes the intensity factor evolution equation under the combined action of compression-shear stress and <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure.</b> In addition, this paper analyzes the propagation of cracks under different <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure</b> which reveals that the existence of <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure</b> facilitates the wing crack’s growth. The result indicates that the high <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure</b> converts wing crack growth from stable form to unstable form. Meanwhile, based on the criterion and mechanism for crack initiation and propagation, this paper puts forward the mechanical model for different fracture transfixion failure modes of the crag bridge under the combined action of <b>seepage</b> <b>pressure</b> and compression-shear stress.

The result shows that, the mutual effect of cracks have large effect on the stress field of crack tip if the intervals of cracks are small.

40|$|Small scale {{field and}} {{laboratory}} observations of sub-glacial sediment deformation suggest that failure is the predominant method of sediment deformation, while large scale modelling studies using a viscous model of till deformation have been reasonably successful {{in predicting the}} geological consequences of ice sheet action. This suggests that the cross-over scale between viscous and plastic deformation occurs at a much larger scale than the grain-grain interaction scale previously thought to be appropriate to deforming till. Sediment deformation and the drainage of sub-glacial areas are considered at different scales, and how these interact to produce failure and viscous behaviour is discussed. A fluctuation length scale is proposed, whose horizontal dimensions are {{of the order of}} the depth of the base of deformation (1 – 10 m). On this length scale, the glacier/deforming bed system is highly variable in time as well as in space. Till deformation occurring at this length scale is plastic, happening though failure events. Three other specific scales are proposed, whose different properties depend on the relative spatial variability of static and <b>seepage</b> <b>pressures</b> and topography. The key theoretical problem which has yet to be solved is how multiple small scale failure events combine into a viscous type flow. This is discussed in the context of self-organised criticality. It is argued that the length scales appropriate for some drainage features are not appreciably larger than the scale for plastic failure events, implying that modelling sub-glacial drainage channels by balancing erosion rates against viscous closure of the channel is misconceived. The outlines of an alternative model involving percolation theory are presented. Certain key questions which can only be settled through observations by glaciologists and glacial geologists are discussed.

40|$|Detailed {{engineering}} geological {{investigation of}} the Brunner Coal Measures overburden, Webb Block, Stockton Colliery, was carried out to determine the principal geotechnical constraints or 'Hazards' to continued opencast development. The Stockton Opencast Mine currently produces 600, 000 tpa with plans to increase production to 1. 2 million tpa. Within the overburden two main lithological units are recognised: coarse, massive, variably cemented sandstones (Unit 1); and fine laminated siltstones and mudstones which are variably carbonaceous and micaceous (Unit 2). The tine laminated unit has a pronounced strength anisotropy, whereas the coarse massive unit is essentially homogeneous. All the materials are within the low to medium strength categories (UCS < 75 MPa). The fine laminated unit dominates the lowest 10 m of overburden and the coarse massive unit the upper 10 m. An iso-ratio map is presented at 1 : 5000 scale, and shows the percentage thickness distribution of both I ithotypes within the Webb Block. The Webb Block is divided by the major Augustus and Baynes Fault Zones into three natural mining blocks. Bedding concordant discontinuities within the overburden include minor bedding plane shears (1 O- 20 mm thick) developed within monoclines, and more substantial shear zones, persistent over at least tens of metres, located at lithological contacts. The Baynes Fault Zone is a monocline developed over inferred faulting at depth, as is the Augustus Fault Zone. The later is more complex with a wider deformation zone (c. 50 m) and has numerous impersistent fault plane exposures. Shearing and/or minor faulting is common throughout the Webb Block but more prevalent {{in close proximity to}} the major fault zones. Jointing is characterised by a parent joint system within which three joint sets, which strike N-S, Nand NE, have been recognised. Within each set fractures are widely spaced and highly persistent. Highwall failure at Webb occurs by toppling, complex wedge/collapse or translational block slide. A Geotechnical Hazards Plan is presented which shows all the major stability hazards within the Webb Block. The principal constraint to opencast development is the unfavourable orientation of geological structures relative to proposed highwall alignments. Instability is further exacerbated by surface and groundwater draining across the high walls with a resultant build up of <b>seepage</b> <b>pressures</b> within the rock mass. The presence of abandoned underground mine openings reduces the basal support for sections of highwall. With continued open pit development at Webb by strike cuts and up dip advance, potential highwall instability is best resolved by:- 1.

Setting the highwalls at safe stand-off distances from the hazards, highwalls can either be located down dip short of the hazard, or up dip by stripping through the hazard zone...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{mechanism}} design of coupling stress and <b>seepage</b> in <b>pressure</b> tunnel, a suggested design criterion for pressure tunnel design procedure in stable rock conditions. Plain concrete lining of pressure tunnels are not absolutely tight and water seeps out of the tunnel resulting to loss of energy and often cause instability in the surrounding rock mass. Nevertheless, prestressing the surrounding rock mass by grouting keeps the seeped water within the vicinity of the tunnel and increase the external water pressure, thereby increasing the tunnel bearing capacity and reduce the seepage/water losses. The crack propagation and the influence of prestressing on the plain concrete lining have been studied and modeling of the phenomenon was performed by hydro-mechanical coupling of stress and seepage calculation performed using Finite Element program. The numerical coupling can be described as follows: the change of stress field changes of permeability coefficient and the change of the seepage field; the new seepage field tend to produce new seepage force and lead to the redistribution of stress field. The numerical model was used to replicate similar research work done and good agreement was recorded. Model was extended to practical example and finally matched with analytical solutions resulting in a rational methodology for the design of plain concrete lining under high internal water pressure of up to 35 bars.

Traditional models for determining fracture initiation pressure (FIP) either consider a wellbore with an impermeable mudcake or with no mudcake at all.

The model can predict pore pressure and stress profiles around the wellbore, and consequently the FIP, for different mudcake thickness, permeability, and strength. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effects of these mudcake parameters. The results show that a low-permeability mudcake enhances FIP, mainly through restricting fluid <b>seepage</b> and pore <b>pressure</b> increase in the near-wellbore region, rather than by mudcake strength. Fluid loss pressure (FLP) should be distinguished from FIP when a mudcake is present on the wellbore wall. Fracture may occur behind the mudcake at FIP without mudcake rupture.
