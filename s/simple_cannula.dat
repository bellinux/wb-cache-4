40|$|Eight female pigs (25 - 65 kg) {{provided}} with a <b>simple</b> T <b>cannula</b> about 10 cm anterior to the ileocaecal valve, were used to study the ileal, post-ileal and fecal digestibility. In experiment 1, 2 Ca/P ratios (1. 5 / 1 and 2. 2 / 1) and 2 dietary P levels (0. 34 and 0. 47 %) were tested according to a 2 x 2 -factorial arrangement within a Latin square design. In experiment 2, the diets of experiment 1 were supplemented with phytase (500 FTU/kg). Supplementation with phytase resulted in an improvement of the fecal P digestibility of 10. 3 % (P< 0. 001). Addition of feed phosphate resulted in 10. 3 % (P< 0. 001) more absorption in the ileum. Addition of limestone reduced the effects.

40|$|Lathyrus cicera is a grain legume {{that is well}} {{adapted to}} grow in low {{rainfall}} regions. However, it contains a neurotoxin, 3 -(-N-oxalyl) -l- 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid (ODAP), which can cause paralysis of the lower limbs, known as "lathyrism". An experiment was conducted to measure the nutrient content and ileal digestible amino acid content of a recently-released low ODAP Lathyrus variety chalus. Chemical analyses and total tract digestibility showed that the new Lathyrus variety chalus contained 0. 9 g ODAP/kg, 265 g crude protein/kg and 13. 5 MJ digestible energy/kg on an as-fed basis. The ileal digestible nutrient content of chalus was measured with six grower pigs (Large White×Landrace, 43 ± 0. 3 kg) fitted with a <b>simple</b> T-piece <b>cannula.</b> The chalus contained 12. 9, 1. 4 and 5. 4 g of apparent ileal digestible lysine, methionine and threonine, respectively/kg.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of tannin levels in sorghum on coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility (CAID), coefficient of standardised ileal digestibility (CSID) of amino acids, and total and specific activity (TA, SA) of trypsin and chymotrypsin of growing pigs. In the first experiment, 24 castrates (60 :L 5 kg) were fitted with a <b>simple</b> T <b>cannula</b> to evaluate four different sorghum samples (I, II, III, and IV) with different tannin levels (1. 4, 4. 6, 9. 8 and 10. 0 g kg(- 1)). At {{the end of the}} trial, pigs were slaughtered to obtain samples of pancreas and intestinal digesta. Data were analysed as a randomized block design. The highest CAID (P < 0. 05) was observed on sorghum I and the lowest on sorghum II. Leucine and glutamic acid were the most digestible amino acids in the four samples of sorghum, with glycine, lysine, threonine and cysteine being the least digestible. As tannin levels increased, proline CAID decreased (P< 0. 05). CSID of amino acids in sorghum I was higher (P< 0. 05) than on sorghum II, except for proline. Similarly, the CSID for isoleucine, lysine, threonine, valine, alanine and aspartic acid was similar among sorghums I, III and IV. Tannin content did not affect pancreas weight, protein content, or TA and SA of trypsin and chymotrypsin on pancreatic tissue. However, in the digesta of duodenum, trypsin TA was increased (P < 0. 05) by 6. 7 % in the two treatments with the highest tannin content. In the second experiment, 32 castrates (53 +/- 7 kg) were fitted with a <b>simple</b> T <b>cannula</b> to evaluate eight different hybrids of sorghum: four Pioneer (8172, 8428, 8443, and 8641), and four Dekalb (D- 45, D- 65, D- 68, and D- 69). High-tannin sorghums (8172 and 8428) had the lowest (P< 0. 05) CAID for arginine, glycine, and proline. Furthermore, sorghum 8428 had the lowest (P< 0. 05) CAID for lysine (0. 339). The CAID for proline was negative (- 0. 110) for sorghum 8428 and extremely low (0. 031) in sorghum 8172. These sorghums had a low (P < 0. 05) CSID for arginine, histidine, and proline. In sorghums with a high content of tannins the CSID for proline and glycine was very low. Lysine CSID was lower (P< 0. 05) in sorghum 8428, when compared to the others samples of sorghums. In conclusion, tannin levels up to 1. 05 % are not the main depressors of the CAID and CSID of amino acids in the sorghum grai...|$|R
40|$|Spring grass {{consisting}} of Lolium perene L. (81 %), Poa pratensis L. (9 %), and annual weeds (5 %) was stored as direct-cut or as wilted silage {{and used in}} feeding trials {{to determine the effects}} of wilting on N utilization. Six mature Friesian cattle, fitted with rumen and <b>simple</b> duodenal <b>cannulae,</b> were fed the silages for ad libitum intake in a crossover design {{consisting of}} two 49 -d periods. Wilting increased intake of organic matter and decreased ruminal apparent digestibility or organic matter and whole tract apparent digestibilities of organic matter, NDF, and total N. Rumen degradability of silage N was increased by wilting (. 7 vs.. 67). Direct-cut silage, in comparison with wilted silage, provide (g/d) less N intake (232 vs. 286) and lower duodenal flows of total N (215 vs. 293), non-NH 3 N (202 vs. 280), microbial N (111 vs. 177), and total amino acids (1056. 8 vs. 1342. 7). Duodenal flows of NH 3 N and undegraded N were not different between silages. Efficiency of bacterial N synthesis in rumen was higher for wilted than for direct-cut silage (32. 3 vs. 21. 4 g N/kg organic matter apparently digested in rumen).

40|$|Many markers {{can be used}} in {{digestibility}} assays for swine, but {{needs to}} be evaluated before its use. An assay was carried out with the objective of measuring the coefficients of ileal apparent (CIAD) and standardized digestibility (CISD) of amino acids in meat and bone meal for swine using different markers. Eight crossbred barrows were equipped with T-cannulas in the distal ileum. Four animals received a free protein diet and another four received a diet containing meat and bone meal as the only protein source in the diet. The treatments consisted in evaluating the chromic oxide, acid-insoluble ash naturally occurring in the diet, cellulose and lignin as markers to determine the apparent and standardized digestibility of the amino acids contained in the meat and bone meal. All data were submitted to analysis of variance and means were compared using the Tukey test, with a significance of 5 %. The CIAD, obtained using chromic oxide as external marker, were lower (P< 0. 05) than those obtained when acid insoluble ash, lignin and cellulose were used as markers, observing differences for all the amino acids evaluated. Similarly, the CISD from all the studied amino acids were lower (P< 0. 05) when the chromic oxide was used for determining the indigestibility factor. It is concluded that chromic oxide used as a external marker, to determine the coefficients of apparent and standardized ileal digestibility of the amino acids of the meat and bone meal, is most appropriate than the acid insoluble ash naturally occurring in diets, lignin and cellulose.

The in vivo ileal digestibility was studied in first experiment using four crossbred barrows (Large White x Landrace x Duroc) with initial average weight of 40 kg BW. The animals were surgically fitted with ileal <b>simple</b> T shape <b>cannula</b> and housed in individual metabolism cage. The experimental diets were 1) broken rice-soybean meal 2) corn-soybean meal 3) cassava starch-soybean meal and 4) cassava starch-sunflower-soybean meals. The experimental work was 4 x 4 latin square design. The in vitro ileal digestibility was studied with the same experimental diets as in the first experiment but using intestinal digesta collected from the same experimental animals. The average value of in vivo ileal digestibility for protein of all treatments (broken rice-soybean meal and corn-soybean meal, cassava starch-soybean meal and cassava starch-sunflower-soybean meals diets) and all feedstuffs (broken rice, corn, soybean meal and sunflower meal) were lower (p< 0. 05) than those of the in vitro methods.

Cattle with a permanent rumen <b>cannula</b> and a <b>simple</b> "T"-piece duodenal <b>cannula</b> were given 4 diets in a 4 X 4 Latin Square experiment. The basal diet (diet C) consisted of grass silage, barley and rapeseed meal (700, 240 and 60 g/kg total DM) given daily or supplemented with sucrose 1. 0 kg given twice daily (Diet S), twice daily with sodium bicarbonate 0. 25 kg/day (diet B) or as a continuous intrarumen infusion (diet I). Giving sucrose supplements decreased CMCase and xylanase activities extracted from microbes associated with rumen particulate material or feed particles incubated in nylon bags compared with diet c. Supplementation of the sucrose diet with sodium bicarbonate resulted in higher CMCase activities than other sucrose diets (S and I). Particle-associated CMCase {{activities were}} very sensitive in detecting differences in the rumen environment and were related to changes in cell wall digestion. Activities were highly correlated with disappearance of DM and neutral-detergent fibre from nylon bags incubated in the rumen, rumen and total digestion of cell-wall carbohydrates and rumen pool size of cell-wall carbohydrates.

40|$|The study {{involved}} developing and applying a routine ileal amino acid digestibility assay, {{based on the}} sampling of digesta from the euthanased laboratory rat, with specific application to the digestion of meat and bone meal (MBM) protein by the growing pig. The work was conducted in six separate experiments. 1. The first experiment aimed to evaluate the slaughter method as a technique for sampling ileal digesta in the pig under defined sampling conditions. In a preliminary investigation, the influence of time after feeding (3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 hours) {{on the amount of}} digesta obtained from the terminal 20 cm of ileum and apparent ileal nitrogen (N) digestibility was determined. Thirty-six 30 kg liveweight entire male pigs were given a semi-synthetic diet containing meat and bone meal (MBM) as the sole protein source and chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. The animals were given the MBM diet for 14 days and were killed by intracardial injection of a barbiturate on the 14 th day. Digesta were flushed from the terminal ileum using deionised water. Secondly, the effect of site in the ileum for sampling digesta at 9 hours post-feeding was determined using 12 entire male pigs. The animals were equally and randomly allocated to two sampling sites (the terminal 0 - 20 cm or 0 - 40 cm of ileum). Further samples of ileal digesta were taken at regular 20 cm intervals up the final 140 cm of ileum of each pig. Sampling at 9 hours after the start of feeding resulted in the greatest and least variable sample size as well as the highest N digestibility. Sampling site within the terminal ileum had no significant (P > 0. 05) influence on the apparent digestibility of nitrogen. In the same study, comparison of apparent ileal amino acid digestibility in MBM, under the defined sampling conditions, was made between 8 pigs whose digesta were sampled from the terminal 20 cm of ileum at death 9 hours after the commencement of feeding, and 8 pigs with simple T-cannulas and with hourly collection of digesta over 10 hours on the final 2 days of the 14 -day study. The simple T-cannulated animals were accepted as the control. There was no significant (P > 0. 05) effect of digesta collection procedure on the apparent ileal N and amino acid digestibility coefficients. Faecal N and amino acid digestibility coefficients in intact pigs were identical to those in pigs fitted with a <b>simple</b> T-piece <b>cannula</b> in the distal ileum. Faecal digestibility values in both intact and cannulated pigs were, however, considerably (P 0. 05) effect on the true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids. The mean apparent ileal digestibility of N in MBM ranged from 65. 6 to 75. 3 %. The corresponding range of true ileal digestibility of N was 76. 9 to 78. 2 % 6. The final experiment generated data on the nutrient compositions of meat and bone meals collected from eight processing plants throughout New Zealand. The true ileal digestibility of the amino acids in the meat and bone meals were also determined using the rat assay developed in the previous studies. Endogenous amino acid excretion, used for the correction of apparent digestibility values to true estimates, was determined for rats given a protein-free or an enzymically hydrolysed casein diet. The meat and bone meals were variable in their nutrient composition and in the true ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids. The true nitrogen and amino acid digestibility coefficients based on endogenous flows determined by the EHC method were markedly higher than with the protein-free diet. The true ileal N and lysine digestibility coefficients based on the respective endogenous flows for rats fed the EHC diet ranged from 62. 7 to 88. 9 % and 66. 4 to 92. 3 %, respectively. Values determined with endogenous flows for rats fed the protein free diet ranged from 59. 0 to 85. 2 % for N, and 63. 2 to 88. 9 for lysine. The variable ileal digestible N and amino acid contents of meat and bone meals emphasise the limitation of tabulated analytical values and the need for a routine relatively inexpensive digestibility assay...|$|R
