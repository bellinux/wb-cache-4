40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relative}} importance of income and household characteristics (such as family size) in explaining differences in household consumption of natural gas and LPG. In a simple model of vertically (willingness to pay) ordered households we posit that {{the relative importance}} of the income elasticity of demand (vs. the family size elasticity) depends positively on the price faced by households. Thus, very low prices tend to depress the across households income elasticity of demand relative to the characteristic-elasticity and the opposite holds for under high prices. We test this hypothesis using, {{for the first time in}} Argentina, data from the household expenditure survey on Natural gas and LPG and compare the cross-consumption equations for both fuels, which have quite different price regimes. Finally, we explore welfare implications for low-user tariff scheme reforms in natural gas. Engel curves Natural gas consumption <b>Social</b> <b>tariffs...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s many heterodox economists joined labor, {{human rights}} and {{environmental}} advocates in calling {{for the inclusion of}} binding labor and environmental standards in trade agreements, along with other measures to ensure that deepening economic integration would serve the goals of promoting human development. Neoclassical trade theorists universally opposed these measures, arguing that countries’ choices over standards represented an entirely legitimate source of comparative advantage. In the end, the free traders prevailed. Over the past five years several mainstream trade theorists have reversed course, and begun to call for fair trade. In this context, fair trade is back on the policy agenda. This paper explores the fair trade proposals that emerged in the 1990 s, and counterpoises the multilateral <b>Social</b> Index <b>Tariff</b> Structure (SITS) as an alternative fair trade regime. A SITS regime seeks to protect high standards in those countries where they prevail, while providing both the incentives and means for countries that perform poorly in this regard to improve their standards over time. This working paper explores the construction of a hypothetical SITS regime; estimates the effects of the regime on bilateral trade flows; and generates estimates of the development funds that SITS would make available to promote human development in low-income countries. The authors find that a global system of <b>social</b> <b>tariffs</b> that are very small in magnitude would generate new, substantial and stable flows of development funds while incentivizing a race to the top in labor and environmental standards. ...|$|R

In some cases a minimum consumption fee applies to all residential connections, and sometimes to commercial and institutional connections. Such subsidies benefit many who are not poor. However, some State Water Companies have improved the targeting of their social tariffs by using the cadastres established for the Bolsa Familia Conditional Cash Transfer program.

40|$|Given the {{relatively}} small {{segment of the population}} that faces genuine affordability problems in Latin America, {{there appears to be a}} promising case for using targeted subsidies to reconcile the cost recovery objective with social protection concerns. <b>Social</b> <b>tariff</b> schemes of various kinds are already widespread in Latin America, but they suffer from a number of design flaws. Increasing block tariff (IBT) structures are the most prevalent form of social tariffs in the region. These are likely to be more successful in the electricity sector than in the water sector because the correlation between consumption and income is much stronger in the case of electricity than water. Moreover, IBT structures in electricity tend to be much better designed than in the case of water, with lower fixed charges, lower subsistence blocks, and steeper gradients. A number of more sophisticated <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> schemes are also being applied that combine consumption criteria with some form of socioeconomic screening.

40|$|In the {{clinical}} and economic evaluation of health care, {{the value of}} benefit gained should be determined from a public perspective. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish relative valuations attached to different health states to form the basis for a <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> for use in quantifying patient benefit from health care. Three thousand three hundred and ninety-five interviews were conducted with a representative sample of the adult British population. Using the EuroQol health state classification and a visual analogue scale (VAS), each respondent valued 15 health states producing, in total, direct valuations for 45 states. Two hundred and twenty-one re-interviews were conducted approximately 10 weeks later. A near complete, and logically consistent, VAS data set was generated with good test-retest reliability (mean ICC= 0. 78).

It highlights that in present day society, {{communications and}} media are a necessity, but not always affordable, and that they furthermore open up for addictive behaviors which raise additional financial and social risks. A simple and efficient methodology compatible with state-of-the-art social and communications business statistics is developed, which produces the residual communications and media affordability budget and ultimately the value-at-risk in terms of usage and tariffs. Sensitivity analysis provides precious information on bottom-up communications and media adoption {{on the basis of}} affordability. This approach differs from the regulated but often ineffective Universal service obligation, which instead of catering for individual needs mostly addresses macro-measures helping geographical access coverage (e. g. in rural areas). It is proposed to requalify the Universal service obligations on operators into concrete measures, allowing, with unchanged funding, the needy to adopt mobile services based on their affordability constraints by bridging the gap to a standard tariff. Case data are surveyed from various countries. ICT policy recommendations are made to support widespread and socially responsible communications access.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess whether}} life-circumstances and {{factors other than}} those {{described}} in the EuroQol EQ- 5 D instrument have a systematic influence on how the same EuroQol health-state is valued. METHOD: A simulation exercise whereby health professionals {{were asked to rate}} the health-state of 16 case-scenarios. Each case-scenario was designed to describe the same EuroQol health-state but was varied systematically using a 4 by 2 factorial design, in terms of ability to work, ability to perform usual leisure activity, age and type of disability. A convenience sample of 41 health professionals studying towards a postgraduate Diploma in Rehabilitation formed the study group. RESULTS: The average valuation was significantly higher than that derived from a <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> model. The following factors contributed to a model which explained 10 % of the variability in valuation scores: characteristics of the assessor [...] years of experience, experience with musculoskeletal disorders, and characteristics of the scenario [...] disability type, ability to work and ability to perform usual leisure activities (beta weights ranged from 0. 093 to 0. 253). Ability to perform usual leisure activities was associated with the greatest influence on the valuation rating. Additionally, professional type had a significant influence on rating with general practitioners giving significantly lower valuations. CONCLUSIONS: The same health-state, as defined by EuroQol EQ- 5 D cannot be regarded as describing similar life-circumstances, sufficient to be valued in the same way. Factors specific to the 'valuer' (experience and professional type) and specific to the 'valuee' (disability type, ability to work or perform usual leisure activities) that are not included in the EQ- 5 D description are significantly associated with different valuation scores.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the modal choice in an ex-mining {{area in the}} North of France. It is a {{deprived}} area under many regeneration strategies focusing on urban projects, such as a new public transportation infrastructure. Urban public transport accounts for 3 % against the national French average of 10 %. Surprisingly, this share does not proportionally change according to urban or rural context. This territory also presents particular socio-economic and land-use characteristics. In this particular territory, is there a potential for guiding transport demand management towards lower carbon mobility? If so, which strategy to implement? We estimate a mode choice model with a nested logit specification for four modes: car driver, car passenger, public transport and walking. Then, we compute demand elasticies to price and time to analyse mobility solutions. We simulate the impact of different transport policies to shift mobility behaviors towards more sustainable ones. The results show a strong inertia in the demand for car use. Only extreme mobility policies lead to a significant increase of the share of public transport. Conventional economic variables are not sufficient to increase the demand for public transport.

40|$|Using an {{inventory}} of local and/or non-statutory transfers in thirteen French towns and cities including Paris, Lyon and Marseille, we measure the gains from returning to work for recipients of means-tested benefits (RMI and API) by type of household. The reforms of national and statutory benefits carried out during the 2000 s, especially those affecting the employment tax credit (PPE), failed {{to ensure that the}} recipients of meanstested benefits always stood to gain from returning to work. In most localities and for most types of household, taking a part-time job on the minimum wage represents a loss of income compared to staying on welfare, and full-time work does not always present any advantage. The effects of the reforms were offset by the effects of other measures such as the widespread provision of travel assistance by regional councils, the development of <b>social</b> <b>tariffs</b> for telephone and electricity, or exemption from paying the television licence fee. We then simulate the effects of introducing the RSA in place of the RMI. We take into account the way that local and/or non-statutory transfers ("droits connexes") are modified by the increases in national transfers. We observe that the RSA does indeed eliminate those areas where returning to work is unprofitable, for almost all localities and types of household. Lastly, we show that the marginal tax rate of 38 % chosen by the government in its bill is very close to the upper limit compatible with a back-to-work incentive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{original}} valuation exercise which {{formed the}} basis of the UK EQ- 5 D time trade-off <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> of health states, employed a sampling scheme involving 43 health states. Neither that study, nor other published international valuations studies have used explicit quantifiable criteria to justify the choice of sampled states. New criteria are proposed and methods described to aid researchers in designing improved sampling schemes for future EQ- 5 D sampling exercises. Method Four such criteria are described, and applied to assess the merits of four sampling schemes previously reported, using three large observational databases to quantify relative performance. An alternative sampling design conforming to these criteria is described, which aims to generate improved performance. Results Previous published approaches are shown to perform poorly against the measured criteria. The alternative sampling design is demonstrated to provide superior performance on all measures. Conclusion Future valuation exercises using sampled health states based on this approach may be expected to offer benefits in terms of greater precision, avoidance of bias in favour of less severe states, and a higher proportion of research observations valued directly rather than dependent on extrapolation modelling. </p...|$|E

40|$|More than {{a decade}} of energy and {{transport}} subsidies have weakened Argentina's fiscal capacity. Following the 2001 crisis, public services tariffs were frozen in an attempt to offset the negative effects on households' real purchasing power. However, these subsidies steadily increased over the years, particularly since 2006, becoming a significant fiscal burden. Though subsidies can be a tool to protect the poor, in Argentina they led to distortions and a large share have been absorbed by upper classes and non-residential consumers. This paper first analyzes the incidence of the 2014 system of residential federal subsidies to residential public services (defined as electricity, gas, water and transport) and then simulates the distributional impacts of alternative subsidy structures. Simulations on the electricity sector suggest that targeting consumption levels through a simple lifeline tariff is not sufficient to achieve a propoor incidence of subsidies. Instead, explicit targeting is necessary (though not sufficient) and needs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the poorest households. Similarly, on the transport sector show that the existing tariffs are not well-targeted, but that an expanded set of social programs could improve coverage of the poorest. Gas subsidy simulations showed that a <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> would virtually eliminate the subsidy, suggesting that there is little overlap between the receipt of social programs and access to piped gas...|$|E

40|$|Water {{conservation}} can {{be encouraged}} with price or non-price instruments. Water prices {{are more often}} directed at cost recovery than water conservation. They vary with location and use. A farmer pays one price to receive water from an irrigation ditch, a family pays a different price to receive drinking water at its tap, an organization might pay a variety of prices to buy water that is then left to flow in-steam for environmental purposes. Prices {{may be found in}} an auction, determined by the average cost of utility service, or set through an administrative procedure. An increase in price often results in a reduction in demand, but the elasticity of this response varies with the price level, use of water, availability of substitutes, and incidence of water prices. This last factor is driven by political or regulatory decisions that explain the existence of block prices, <b>social</b> <b>tariffs,</b> sectorial cross-subsidies, regulatory exemptions, and other “adjustments ” that distort consumption decisions and conservation investments. For the sake of this article, assume that it costs one dollar to receive one cubic meter of drinking water (265 gallons), a number that’s close to three dollars per ccf (hundred cubic feet of water, or 748 gallons); see Zetland and Gasson (2012) for a global survey of water prices.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{empirical}} and methodological cost-effectiveness evidence of surgical interventions for breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. Methods: A systematic search of seven databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and NHSEED, research registers, the NICE Web site and conference proceedings was conducted in April 2012. Study quality was assessed in terms of meeting essential, preferred and UK NICE specific requirements for economic evaluations. Results: The seventeen (breast = 3, colorectal = 7, prostate = 7) included studies covered a broad range of settings (nine European; eight non-European) and six were published over 10 years ago. The populations, interventions and comparators were generally well defined. Very few studies were informed by literature reviews and few used synthesized clinical evidence. Although the interventions had potential differential effects on recurrence and mortality rates, some studies used relatively short time horizons. Univariate sensitivity analyses were reported in all studies but less than a third characterized all uncertainty with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Although a third of studies incorporated patients' health-related quality of life data, only four studies used <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> values. Conclusions: There is a dearth of recent robust evidence describing the cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions in the management of breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Many of the recent publications did not satisfy essential methodological requirements such as using clinical evidence informed by a systematic review and synthesis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chondral defects of {{the knee}} {{cartilage}} are prevalent. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and mosaicplasty are increasingly used to treat symptomatic knee defects. This study assessed the costs and health status outcomes after ACI and mosaicplasty. METHODS: Patients were eligible {{to participate in this}} cross-sectional study if they received ACI or mosaicplasty at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital between 1997 and 2001 or were on a waiting list for ACI. Secondary-care resource use was collected to 2 years postoperatively using a resource collection proforma. Participants responded to postal questions about sociodemographic characteristics and knee-related (Modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System) and general health status (EQ- 5 D). RESULTS: Fifty-three ACI, twenty mosaicplasty, and twenty-two patients waiting for ACI participated. The average cost per patient was higher for ACI (10, 600 pounds sterling: 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 10, 036 pounds sterling- 11, 214 pounds sterling) than mosaicplasty (7, 948 pounds sterling: 95 percent CI, 6, 957 pounds sterling- 9, 243 pounds sterling). Postoperatively, ACI and mosaicplasty patients (combined) experienced better health status than those waiting for ACI. ACI patients tended to have better health status outcomes than mosaicplasty patients (not statistically significant). Estimated average EQ- 5 D <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> improvements for quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations were 0. 23 (ACI) and 0. 06 (mosaicplasty).

Methods: Pharmacoeconomic models were developed to compare treatment costs and effects (QALYs) in theoretical populations of 1000 IBD patients over a 1 -year period. Efficacy and tolerability profiles for AZA and MTX {{were taken from the}} literature. The costs (year 2004 values) of the drugs and treatment of adverse effects were estimated from New Zealand drug and service costs. Representations of the patients' health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were obtained from clinicians via the EQ- 5 D health state classification system and valued using the New Zealand EQ- 5 D <b>social</b> <b>tariff.</b> The effects of genotyping or phenotyping a population for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) status were compared using the prevalence of TPMT deficiency in Caucasians, the relative risks of neutropenia and the associated costs. Results: Net cost savings (vs no immunosuppressant treatment) of approximately $NZ 2. 5 million and $NZ 1 million were realised for AZA and MTX, respectively, for the theoretical 1000 patients, and AZA generated 877 QALYs compared with 633 for MTX. Phenotype and genotype testing generated net cost savings (vs no testing) of $NZ 120 _ 000 and $NZ 11 _ 000, respectively. Savings related to phenotype tests were greater because of the lower assay costs of phenotype testing and a greater likelihood of pre-empting neutropenia. Conclusion: Our model suggests that both MTX and AZA may generate significant net cost savings and benefits for patients with IBD in New Zealand, with AZA likely to be more cost effective than MTX. Prospective testing for poor metabolisers of AZA may also be cost effective, with phenotype testing likely to be more cost effective than genotype testing.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the health utilities of patients with dementia in Europe and identify the key factors influencing their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQol). Methods This study used cross-sectional data from the Odense study; a Danish cohort of patients aged 65 – 84 living in Odense, Denmark. A total of 244 patients with mild to severe dementia were interviewed together with a caregiver about their health status and activities of daily living (ADL). Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable dementia. Vascular dementia and other types of dementia were diagnosed according to the DSM-IIIR criteria. Severity of dementia was defined by score intervals on the Mini Mental State Examination score: mild (MMSE 20 – 30), moderate (MMSE 10 – 19), and severe (MMSE 0 – 9). Based on the ADL information, the patients' dependency level was defined as either dependent or independent. Questions from the Odense Study were mapped into each of the five dimensions of the EQ- 5 D in order to assess patients' HRQol. Danish EQ- 5 D <b>social</b> <b>tariffs</b> were used to value patients' HRQol.

40|$|An {{important}} consideration when establishing priorities {{in health care}} is the likely effects that alternative allocations of resources will have on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This paper reports on the analysis of data from a study which elicited health state valuations (using the time trade-off (TTO) method) from {{a representative sample of}} the UK health population. Health states were defined in terms of the EuroQol Descriptive System which generates 243 theoretically possible states. Because it was impossible to generate direct valuations for all of these states, it was necessary to find a procedure that allowed interpolation of valuations for all EuroQol states from direct valuations on a subset of these. This paper describes (in as non-technical manner as possible) the modelling technique used to generate a set of EuroQol valuations from directly observed valuations on 45 states. The specification of the models tested was derived from the ordinal nature of the EuroQol descriptive system, in which the value assigned to a particular state depends on the level of each dimension. Data were analysed at the individual level using a generalised least squares regression technique. A model that fitted the data well and that was readily interpretable was one in which valuations were explained in terms of three different elements: 1) the level of severity associated with each dimension independently of the levels of the other dimensions; 2) an intercept associated with any move away from full health; and 3) a term which identified whether any dimension was at its most severe level. The coefficients on these variables can be used to build up a fill ‘tariff’ of EuroQol values representing the views of a representative sample of the UK adult population. This <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> has a number of potential uses, including the measurement of the likely impact on health status of different health care programmes or policies.

Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that cognitive impairment was associated with educational level (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 096, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 011 – 0. 447) and poorer quality of life measured by the EuroQoL- 5 dimensions <b>social</b> <b>tariff</b> (OR = 0. 967, 95 % CI = 0. 950 – 0. 983). When questionnaires {{were not included in the}} analysis, cognitive impairment was associated with educational level (OR = 0. 063, 95 % CI = 0. 010 – 0. 934), number of exacerbations (OR = 11. 070, 95 % CI = 1. 450 – 84. 534), Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exacerbations index score (OR = 1. 261, 95 % CI = 1. 049 – 1. 515), and the Charlson comorbidity index (OR = 1. 412, 95 % CI = 1. 118 – 1. 783). Conclusion: Cognitive impairment is common in COPD and is associated with low educational level, higher disease severity, and increased comorbidity. This could have therapeutic implications for this population.

50|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{economically}} difficult and industrially conflictual 1890s, the six colonies agreed to federate as the Commonwealth of Australia. The establishment of a national government spanning the continent and the transfer of certain key functions to that government entailed the establishment of new national policies in regard to a range of important economic and <b>social</b> matters. Customs <b>tariffs,</b> for instance, immediately became an exclusive concern of the Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth assumed primacy {{in a number of other}} areas such as immigration.|$|R

This paper formulates two agent-based models to investigate this area. The first model explores the effects of <b>social</b> networks and <b>tariff</b> structures on water conservation. The second model uses a memetic framework to explore how imitation of technology adoption and water use behaviour can impact on water conservation. Simulations show realistic seasonally fluctuating water usage. Social networks are demonstrated to have significant effects on simulated water use and the distribution of water savers.

40|$|Bachelor thesis Analysis of {{expectation}} of the EU from TTIP is an overview analysis. This text covers four main areas regarding TTIP. Those topics are engineering industry, automotive industry, public procurements and agriculture. The analysis covers {{expectations of the}} European Union, partly of the Czech Republic and touches expectations of the United States of America a little bit. The author used only official document of the governmental institutions and scientific documents as resources. Any scientific documents and official papers issued before 8 th of November 2016 were not used. The reason behind that are American presidential elections. Those elections shifted expectations from the TTIP. Unofficial and non-professional texts were not used at all. The analysis follows topics from several points of view. Those perspectives are <b>social</b> sphere, <b>tariff</b> measures, non-tariff issues, possible gains, and controversial topics. Requirements regarding the customer's safety are included as well. Possible changes in regulations are also analyzed. The text is interspersed with figures that support numerical data...|$|R
40|$|We first {{construct}} three {{measures of}} the expected damage from the unintentional introduction of alien species into a country called Home. We then focus on four market structures. First, perfect competition prevails in both Home and Foreign and Home is a small country. Second, the Home and the Foreign markets are both perfectly competitive but Home is now a large country. Third, the exporter in Foreign is a monopolist {{and there are no}} import competing firms in Home. Finally, the Foreign exporter and the import competing firm in Home engage in Cournot competition. In all four scenarios, we analyze the impact of small and optimal Home tariffs on prices, exports, imports, the damage from alien species, and social welfare, in Home. Inter alia, our analysis identifies conditions under which it makes sense to use trade policy (tariffs) to regulate invasive species and conditions under which it does not.
