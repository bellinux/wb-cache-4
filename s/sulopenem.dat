The MIC 50 s of {{amoxicillin}} for {{the corresponding}} strains were 0. 03, 0. 25, and 2. 0 μg/ml, respectively, and the MIC 90 s were 0. 03, 1. 0, and 8. 0 μg/ml, respectively. The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate gave MICs {{similar to those}} obtained with amoxicillin alone. The <b>sulopenem</b> MICs {{were similar to those}} of imipenem and meropenem. The MICs of ß-lactams increased with those of penicillin G, and among the quinolones tested, moxifloxacin had the lowest MICs. Additionally, 45 strains of drug-resistant type 19 A pneumococci were tested by agar dilution and gave <b>sulopenem</b> MIC 50 s and MIC 90 s of 1. 0 and 2. 0 μg/ml, respectively. Both <b>sulopenem</b> and amoxicillin (with and without clavulanate) were bactericidal against all 12 strains tested at 2 × MIC after 24 h. Thirty-one strains from 10 countries with various penicillin, amoxicillin, and carbapenems MICs, including those with the highest <b>sulopenem</b> MICs, were selected for sequencing analysis of the pbp 1 a, pbp 2 x, and pbp 2 b regions encoding the transpeptidase active site and MurM.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{exhibits}} high intrinsic {{resistance to}} penem antibiotics such as faropenem, riti-penem, AMA 3176, <b>sulopenem,</b> Sch 29482, and Sch 34343. To investigate the mechanisms contributing to penem resistance, {{we used the}} laboratory strain PAO 1 to construct a series of isogenic mutants with an impaired multidrug efflux system MexAB-OprM and/or impaired chromosomal AmpC b-lactamase. The outer mem-brane barrier of PAO 1 was partially eliminated by inducing {{the expression of the}} plasmid-encoded Escherichia coli major porin OmpF. Susceptibility tests using the mutants and the OmpF expression plasmid showed that MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier, but not AmpC b-lactamase, are the main mechanisms involved in the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO 1. However, reducing the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO 1 to the same level as that of penem-susceptible gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli required the loss of either both MexAB-OprM and AmpC b-lactamase or both MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier. Competition experiments for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) revealed that the affinity of PBP 1 b and PBP 2 for faropenem were about 1. 8 - and 1. 5 -fold lower, than the respective affinity for imipenem. Loss of the outer membrane barrier, MexAB, and AmpC b-lactamase increased the susceptibility of PAO 1 to almost all penems tested compared to the susceptibility of the AmpC-deficient PAO 1 mutants to imipenem. Thus, it is suggested that the high intrinsic penem resistance of P. aeruginosa is generated from the interplay among the oute...|$|E
40|$|Acinetobacter spp. are {{emerging}} as opportunistic hospital pathogens that demonstrate resistance to many classes of antibiotics. In a metropolitan hospital in Cleveland, a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii that tested resistant to cefepime and ceftazidime (MIC = 32 μg/ml) was identified. Herein, {{we sought to}} determine the molecular basis for the extended-spectrum-cephalosporin resistance. Using analytical isoelectric focusing, a β-lactamase with a pI of ≥ 9. 2 was detected. PCR amplification with specific A. baumannii cephalosporinase primers yielded a 1, 152 -bp product which, when sequenced, identified a novel 383 -amino-acid class C enzyme. Expressed in Escherichia coli DH 10 B, this β-lactamase demonstrated greater resistance against ceftazidime and cefotaxime than cefepime (4. 0 μg/ml versus 0. 06 μg/ml). The kinetic characteristics of this β-lactamase were similar to other cephalosporinases found in Acinetobacter spp. In addition, this cephalosporinase was inhibited by meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, and <b>sulopenem</b> (Ki < 40 μM). The amino acid compositions of this novel enzyme and other class C β-lactamases thus far described for A. baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3, and Oligella urethralis in Europe and South Africa suggest that this cephalosporinase defines a unique family of class C enzymes. We propose a uniform designation for this family of cephalosporinases (Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases [ADC]) found in Acinetobacter spp. and identify this enzyme as ADC- 7 β-lactamase. The coalescence of Acinetobacter ampC β-lactamases into a single common ancestor and the substantial phylogenetic distance separating them from other ampC genes support the logical value of developing a system of nomenclature for these Acinetobacter cephalosporinase genes...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{isolates}} of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{resistant to}} carbapenems and essentially all other antibiotics (multidrug resistant) are being isolated from some hospitals in New York City with increasing frequency. A highly related pair of K. pneumoniae strains isolated {{on the same}} day from one patient in a hospital in New York City were studied for antibiotic resistance. One (KP- 2) was resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and <b>sulopenem</b> (MICs of 16 to 32 μg/ml) while the other (KP- 1) was susceptible (MIC of 0. 5 μg/ml); both contained the blaACT- 1, blaSHV- 1, and blaTEM- 1 β-lactamases. blaACT- 1 in both strains was encoded on a large ∼ 150 -kb plasmid. Both isolates contained an identical class 1 integron encoding resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. They each had identical insertions in ompK 35 and ompK 36, resulting in disruption of these key porin genes. The carbapenem-resistant and -susceptible isolates were extensively studied for differences in the structural and regulatory genes for the operons acrRAB, marORAB, romA-ramA, soxRS, micF, micC, phoE, phoBR, rpoS, and hfq. No changes were detected between the isolates except for a significant down-regulation of ompK 37, phoB, and phoE in KP- 2 as deduced from reverse transcription-PCR analysis of mRNA and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of outer membrane proteins. Backcross analysis was conducted using the wild-type phoE gene cloned into the vector pGEM under regulation of its native promoter as well as the lacZ promoter following transformation into the resistant KP- 2 isolate. The wild-type gene reversed carbapenem resistance only when under control of the heterologous lacZ promoter. In the background of ompK 35 -ompK 36 gene disruption, the up-regulation of phoE in KP- 1 apparently compensated for porin loss and conferred carbapenem susceptibility. Down-regulation of phoE in KP- 2 may represent the normal state of this gene, or it may have been selected from KP- 1 in vivo under antibiotic pressure, generating the carbapenem-resistant clone. This is the first study in the Enterobacteriaceae where expression of the phosphate-regulated PhoE porin has been associated with resistance to antimicrobials. Our results with this pair of Klebsiella clinical isolates highlight the complex and evolving nature of multiple drug resistance in this species...|$|E
40|$|This Account {{describes}} {{the use of}} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how mutations alter the structure and organization of enzyme active sites. As proposed by Pauling about 70 years ago and elaborated by many others since then, biocatalysis is efficient when functional groups in the active site of an enzyme are in optimal positions for transition state stabilization. Changes in mechanism and covalent interactions are often critical parts of enzyme catalysis. We describe our explorations of the dynamical preorganization of active sites using MD, studying the fluctuations between active and inactive conformations normally concealed to static crystallography. MD shows how the various arrangements of active site residues influence the free energy of the transition state and relates the populations of the catalytic conformational ensemble to the enzyme activity. This Account is organized around three case studies from our laboratory. We first describe the importance of dynamics in evaluating a series of computationally designed and experimentally evolved enzymes for the Kemp elimination, a popular subject in the enzyme design field. We find that {{the dynamics of the}} active site is influenced not only by the original sequence design and subsequent mutations but also {{by the nature of the}} ligand present in the active site. In the second example, we show how microsecond MD has been used to uncover the role of remote mutations in the active site dynamics and catalysis of a transesterase, LovD. This enzyme was evolved by Tang at UCLA and Codexis, Inc., and is a useful commercial catalyst for the production of the drug simvastatin. X-ray analysis of inactive and active mutants did not reveal differences in the active sites, but relatively long time scale MD in solution showed that the active site of the wild-type enzyme preorganizes only upon binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) that delivers the natural acyl group to the active site. In the absence of bound ACP, a noncatalytic arrangement of the catalytic triad is dominant. Unnatural truncated substrates are inactive because of the lack of protein-protein interactions provided by the ACP. Directed evolution is able to gradually restore the catalytic organization of the active site by motion of the protein backbone that alters the active site geometry. In the third case, we demonstrate the key role of MD in combination with crystallography to identify the origins of substrate-dependent stereoselectivities in a number of Codexis-engineered ketoreductases, one of which is used commercially for the production of the antibiotic <b>sulopenem.</b> Here, mutations alter the shape of the active site as well as the accessibility of water to different regions of it. Each of these examples reveals something different about how mutations can influence enzyme activity and shows that directed evolution, like natural evolution, can increase catalytic activity in a variety of remarkable and often subtle waysThis research was supported by NIH NIGMS (GM 036700, GM 097200, and GM 075962).
