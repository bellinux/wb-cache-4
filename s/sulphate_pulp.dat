The influence of clone site is by {{far more important than}} that of the clone age. Bark content up to 15 per cent has no negative influence on the elasto-mechanical properties of UF-bonded boards.

Sample 1 came directly from “Mondi Syktyvkar”, samples 2 and 3 were produced in the laboratory of Chemical Department, Syktyvkar Forest Institute. The pulp samples were further analyzed by different methods: extractive substances content were determined, aldehyde groups content was found by a photocolorimetric method, Kappa number was determined by permanganate index, and finally electron microscopy of the three samples was done. Further, residual lignin extraction from <b>sulphate</b> <b>pulp</b> was conducted, and the lignin samples obtained were conducted by ÑÍ 3 ÑÎÎÍ-Í 2 Î – ZnCl 2 blend. Extracted residual lignin was estimated by Komarov’s method, the amount of carboxyl groups in lignin was determined by potentiometry method, lignin molecular weight was calculated by cryoscopy method. Finally, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to analyze extracted lignin spectrum. During the bleaching process, the lignin content of the pulp decreased from 16 to 9 Kappa units. Also, {{a reduction in the}} amount of aldehyde group was observed after the second bleaching stage compared to the first stage.

40|$|The {{colouring}} {{matter is the}} name applied to a coloured material believed {{to be present in}} chemical wood pulps and regarded, by workers in the field, to be of considerable importance in the bleaching of these pulps. In the production of a good quality white pulp from wood, two main steps are involved, namely the "cooking" of the wood, and the bleaching of the raw pulp obtained. [ [...] . ] Of the two main types of chemical pulps used commercially, namely, (a) acid or sulphite pulps, (prepared by heating under pressure with acid bisulphite solutions), and (b) alkaline pulps (prepared by heating under pressure with aqueous alkalies), the latter present by far the greater problem {{from the point of view}} of bleaching. Kraft pulps are especially difficult to bleach to a permanent white colour. The final colour is almost always slightly yellowish despite the fact that the "chlorine consumption" of these pulps is much larger than with sulphite and soda pulps. At this point it may be advisable to define the terms kraft and sulphate, since the careless use of these terms often leads to confusion. <b>Sulphate</b> <b>pulp</b> is produced by any alkaline "cooking" process in which the alkali lost is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate in the regeneration of the "spent-liquor".

40|$|Kraft pulping, {{also known}} as <b>sulphate</b> <b>pulping</b> is a complex process where the wood {{components}} are liberated from each other facilitated by chemical reactions. During the pulping process some dissolved and degraded compounds end up together with the spent cooking chemicals in the black liquor. In kraft pulping of hardwood, the black liquor contains substantial amounts of dissolved hemicellulose, especially xylan due to the wood composition. The xylan content is of high value due to its ability to re-deposit by adsorption on cellulose fibres and its tendency to increase pulp strength and yield. In this work, the possibility of introducing xylan rich, hardwood black liquor from the hardwood digester into the softwood digester at the process of SCA – Munksund was studied. The objective was to investigate if hardwood black liquor addition in a softwood cook can increase the yield and pulp strength. The theoretical feasibility of altering the process was investigated by a literature review and a brief process investigation. During the study a total of eight lab cooks were conducted to obtain information on how hardwood black liquor addition changes the pulp quality of regular softwood cooks. The wood chips, white liquor and hardwood black liquor used were collected at Munksund and the process conditions in the lab cooks were chosen to simulate the actual process in the Munksund mill. In addition to the cooking, chemical and physical evaluation on pulps, cooking liquors and wood chips were performed. The theoretical evaluation indicates that the process in Munksund is well suited for introducing the hardwood black liquor in to the softwood digester. The chemical analysis of the black liquors show a xylan content that is approximately four times higher in the hardwood black liquor compared to the softwood black liquor. In the kappa number range of approximately 80 - 90, a total yield increase of 0. 4 %-units was obtained for two cooks with hardwood black liquor addition compared to their corresponding reference cooks. A carbohydrate analysis showed a higher xylan content in the pulp cooked with addition of hardwood black liquor compared to the corresponding reference pulp. One pulp with hardwood black liquor addition and its corresponding reference cook were refined in an Escher Wyss lab mill. The pulp with hardwood black liquor addition exhibits an increase or retained strength for all strength evaluation tests made on handmade pulp sheets. Strength increases of approximately 5 % were obtained for tensile index and ISO-Z strength for a pulp with hardwood black liquor addition.   The results conducted in this study shows {{that it can be}} possible to slightly increase both the yield and some pulp strength parameters when adding hardwood black liquor in to the softwood cook in lab scale. It is also shown that the increase in the total yield most likely depends on xylan adsorption on the cellulose fibres. The calculated increased revenue for this process change could be over 400 000 Euro per year. ...|$|R
