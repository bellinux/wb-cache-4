5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the son of Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E
5000|$|Kelley Paul, wife of Rand Paul said in 2015 when he {{made his}} 2016 White House bid, [...] "Being a {{physician}} gives Rand a unique perspective in Washington, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> trained to diagnose a problem and find a solution." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} season, Red takes a liking to Hyde's new friend and co-worker, Randy Pearson (Josh Meyers). Red respects Randy <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> the polar {{opposite}} of Eric: masculine, crafty {{and not at}} all obsessed with Star Wars (though in one episode, it is shown that Randy is indeed a fan). Unlike Kitty, Red had no problem with him starting a relationship with Donna.|$|R
5000|$|The Blot soon reappeared {{in another}} Mouse Works short titled [...] "Mickey and the Color Caper", this one {{featured}} in the Disney's House of Mouse episode [...] "Where's Minnie?" [...] In this short, the Blot is now stealing colors from everything in the world, including Minnie Mouse, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> bored with his inky black cloth and plans to become The Phantom Rainbow. Again, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy show up to foil his plans.|$|R
5|$|UNITY is {{a secret}} {{international}} organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders that want {{to take over the}} world. In 1960, over half of the UNITY's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week, leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage. They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor, Bruno Lawrie, on a series of high-profile missions. Cate is an ex-, and is UNITY's first female spy operative. UNITY's leaders, Jones and Smith, are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent, and have previously relegated her to more mundane assignments. Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named Dmitrij Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY's former agents. Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov. In the UNITY headquarters, Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the traitor, to which Cate reacts with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 several leading {{officials}} {{tried to}} persuade Gorbachev to force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> opposed some of Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected {{a member of the}} Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990 the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union support for Ryzhkov's economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov's economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary Interregional Group's vote of no confidence in Ryzhkov's government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet's resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov's orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.|$|E
25|$|Adoration is {{the first}} {{attitude}} of man acknowledging {{that he is a}} creature before his Creator. Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory, quite beyond what He does, but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>He</b> is.|$|E

Looking dynamite in a flashy gold Donatella-goes-Mesopotamian number and a souffl√© of blond curls, Mazzie's campy delivery of [...] "Not Since Nineveh" [...] and the beyond-jaded [...] "Bored" [...] succeeds in briefly raising {{the temperature of the}} otherwise tepid brew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'What did {{you have}} to do with it?' he asked, cocking his head in what I always thought a most impudent manner. Do you know, he puts on more airs and graces than a peacock, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> the only bird that has a red vest to go with a brown coat? Of course I told him the whole story, though there wasn't any need for me to say that I'd been frightened nearly out of my wits, and before I'd {{finished}} Mr. Crow called the meeting to order.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Ohio Senate, Carran was {{regarded}} as of extremely sunny disposition and given the nickname [...] "Laughing Tom," [...] owing to the fact that, as one contemporary put it, [...] "he <b>simply</b> laughs <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can't help it." ...|$|R
25|$|Next, the Court {{found that}} fair {{criticism}} {{should not be}} limited to criticism raised through formal legal avenues, which include court proceedings and the removal of judges under Article 98(3) of the Constitution. This limitation overburdens the right of free speech, and a person should not be prevented from raising rationally supported criticism <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> or she does not have access to formal avenues.|$|E
25|$|Austin Trevor debuted {{the role}} of Poirot on screen in the 1931 British film Alibi. The film {{was based on the}} stage play. Trevor reprised {{the role of}} Poirot twice, in Black Coffee and Lord Edgware Dies. Trevor said once that he was {{probably}} cast as Poirot <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could do a French accent. Leslie S. Hiscott directed the first two films, with Henry Edwards taking over for the third.|$|E
25|$|Guy Anderson {{never quite}} {{achieved}} the international stature {{of his friends}} Tobey and Graves. This was partly due to bad luck - such as a newspaper strike leaving his first solo exhibition in New York (at the Smolin Gallery in 1962) unreviewed - but he turned down other important exhibition opportunities <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt he didn't have enough material of sufficient quality ready. He remained a pre-eminent artist with strong sales and major commissioned projects in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

60|$|Condor {{belonged to}} the latter class. As he lay in bed he saw clearly {{that he had made}} a great mistake, that his successes had been won <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> those <b>he</b> licked were less skilled or strong than himself, and that, in point of fact, instead of being, as he believed, a good boxer, he knew next to nothing about it.|$|R

25|$|At the end {{of almost}} every sketch, all three celebrities have scores in the {{negative}} thousands of dollars, and in most cases, a humorous, often sexual, Final Jeopardy! punchline is delivered by Connery. In one of his sketches, Reynolds is declared an unquestioned winner, even though he wins <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has {{the least amount of}} negative money, rather than actually earning a victory. When Trebek ends the show, he either states that money will not be awarded to charity or announces his intention to resign or commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|It was {{his only}} Wimbledon, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> couldn't afford regular long trips away playing amateur tennis. On his return {{he took a job}} in a {{sporting}} goods store in Johannesburg run by the former Yugoslavian tennis player Franjo Kukuljeviƒá. He improved his tennis in the Johannesburg club competition but was unable to reach the South African Davis Cup team. After he returned to King William's Town to help his father with his growing sporting goods store, he gave up regular tennis because the local standard was so low, and concentrated on cricket.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) {{complain}} about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that they strike {{back at the}} two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow {{to break into the}} office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accessory before the fact <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knows about the proposed burglary.|$|E

'I should say decidedly that the fellow was a very rare character, so long as by rare you don't mean good. It's one of the dullest stupidities of the present day, my dear fellow, to dote on a man <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> {{different}} from the rest of us. Once a man strays out of the common herd, he's more likely to meet wolves in the thickets than angels. From what I can gather in just these few pages this Sabathier appears to have been an amorous, adventurous, emotional Frenchman, who went to the dogs as easily and as rapidly as his own nature and his period allowed. And I should say, Lawford, that he made precious bad reading for a poor old troubled hermit like yourself at the present moment.' ...|$|R
25|$|Shortly after a reformation of the Avengers, the Vision sustains massive {{damage in}} the final battle with the sorceress Morgan Le Fey, and {{although}} incapacitated for several weeks, is eventually rebuilt and recovers. While recovering, the Vision gives up his attempt to reconcile with his wife, although he is revealed to retain a fondness for her culture, such as visiting a restaurant that specifically caters to Wanda's childhood community <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> enjoys the ambience. Remaining {{a member of the}} Avengers, he briefly becomes romantically involved with teammates Carol Danvers (a.k.a.

25|$|Crisp {{was in his}} eighties by {{the time}} he quit acting entirely, {{continuing}} to work long after financially necessary <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed it. He was married twice. He was divorced from his first wife in 1919. He later married film screenwriter Jane Murfin, whom he divorced in 1944. He died in 1974, a few months short of his 92nd birthday, due to complications from a series of strokes. In addition to being one of the premier character actors of his era, he left behind an extensive list of contributions to the film industry he worked to promote for more than fifty years. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.|$|E
25|$|During the conflict, Richard became {{infatuated}} with Beatrice, then 15 {{years old and}} renowned for her beauty. Concerned for her safety, Richard had her taken to her paternal half-uncle, Philip of Bolanden-Hohenfels, and soon began negotiating marriage with her. Beatrice became his third wife and queen of the Romans in Kaiserslautern on 16 June 1269. With her father dead and her powerful uncle hopelessly imprisoned, Beatrice was not a political asset; Richard married her <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was attracted to her {{and was unable to}} be separated from her for even one night. The chronicler Thomas Wykes nevertheless emphasises the political significance of the marriage: Beatrice was German and would bring the English king of Germany closer to his subjects and to his kingdom.|$|E
60|$|Believing that Dan {{was being}} searched {{for by the}} {{attorneys}} <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> had done in the affair, Joe considered the amateur detective had such a claim upon him as could not be resisted; yet, at the same time, he {{was determined not to}} add a fourth member to aunt Dorcas's family.|$|R

5000|$|Jodene Sparks (Bill Lobley) - is the station's radio {{operator}} {{who is always}} seen sitting and with his headsets on. Sparks mostly uses the radio for his own personal purposes, even {{going so far as}} to disconnect vital transmissions that interrupt him. He generally travels around in his office chair, either <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is crippled or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> lazy. Sparks is a convict serving time at Sealab while still operating a blackmarket distillery and takes part in a wide variety of other illegal activities. He occasionally serves as a voice of reason to the crew, particularly to Murphy. However, he is just as often the catalyst of problems aboard Sealab, including Sealab's destruction. He's claustrophobic and a Malkin, the show's version of Wiccan. Sparks's quest for money has been in several plots; such as the murdering of the crew to collect on life insurance policies, the creation of Stimutacs to [...] "make an assload of money", and his numerous underhand deals with Paddy O'Reilly and the various Daves. An early episode revealed that he acts as a criminal mastermind called [...] "Overlord" [...] with a hollowed out volcano base and an army of minions.

25|$|A Holocaust {{survivor}} named Joseph Tschofenig wrote {{a statement}} on these seawater experiments at Dachau. Tschofenig explained how while working at the medical experimentation stations he gained insight {{into some of the}} experiments that were performed on prisoners, namely those where they were forced to drink salt water. Tschofenig also described how victims of the experiments had trouble eating and would desperately seek out any source of water including old floor rags. Tschofenig was responsible for using the X-ray machine in the infirmary and describes how even though he had insight into what was going on he was powerless to stop it. He gives the example of a patient in the infirmary who was sent to the gas chambers by Dr. Sigmund Rascher <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> witnessed one of the low-pressure experiments.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reasons were}} {{initially}} posited by media sources {{and family members}} for why Menezes may have run from police, as indicated by initial reports. A few weeks prior, he had been attacked by a gang and may have perceived {{that he was in}} a similar situation upon seeing plainclothes officers chasing him. Several sources have speculated that irregularities about his immigration status may have given him reason to be wary of the police; evidence that emerged {{during the course of the}} criminal trial into the Health and Safety charge showed that Menezes was lawfully in the country on 22 July 2005. This is mentioned in the Stockwell One report, at footnote 4 on page 21. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a colleague believed that Menezes ran <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was late for his job. It was later indicated by the leaked IPCC documents that Menezes may have run across the platform to get a seat on the train, and did not know at the time that he was being watched or pursued.|$|E
25|$|Albert Andrew Muwalo Gandale Nqumayo (1927 ‚Äì 1977) was a {{prominent}} politician in Malawi from the 1960s until he lost power in 1976 and was executed in 1977. He entered politics in the mid 1950s through involvement in a hospital worker's trade union and membership of the Nyasaland African Congress, where his activities led to his detention without trial during the 1959 State of Emergency in Nyasaland. After his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), and became locally prominent in Ntcheu District as district MCP chairman and from 1962 as Member of Parliament for Ntcheu South. In 1963, he became Administrative Secretary of the MCP, and he was {{a prominent}} supporter of the then-Prime Minister, Hastings Banda during the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Muwalo was rewarded for his loyalty with the cabinet post of Minister of Information in 1964, and in 1966 he became Minister of State in the President's Office. His close contact with Banda, both as minister in Banda's office and in the MCP gave him great power and, {{during the first half of}} the 1970s he and his relative, the Head of the Police Special Branch Focus Gwede, were heavily involved in the political repression of actual or suspected opponents of the Banda regime. In 1976 he and Gwede were arrested: the reasons for their arrests were unclear, but may have resulted from a power struggle among those around the ageing president or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> became too powerful and may have been seen by Banda as a threat. In 1977, the two were tried before a Traditional Court and after a trial whose fairness was in serious doubt, were both sentenced to death. Gwede was reprieved, but Muwalo was hanged on 3 September 1977.|$|E
