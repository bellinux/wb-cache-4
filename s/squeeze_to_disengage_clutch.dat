5000|$|Earlier, and by many manufacturers, an {{arrangement}} <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called [...] "freewheeling", it was bedeviled {{by the absence}} of adequate brakes.|$|R
60|$|He {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> {{the wing}} <b>clutch.</b> He did so. The lever resisted his strength for a time, then over it came, and instantly {{the tail of}} the machine cocked up and the wings became rigidly spread. Instantly everything was swift and smooth and silent. He was gliding rapidly down the air against a wild gale of wind, his eyes three-quarters shut.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} use {{a mechanical}} clutch to transmit torque, {{rather than a}} torque converter, thus avoiding {{the primary source of}} loss in an automatic transmission. Manual transmissions also avoid the power requirement of the hydraulic control system, by relying on the human muscle power of the vehicle operator <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> and actuate the gear levers, and the mental power of the operator to make appropriate gear ratio selections. Thus the manual transmission requires very little engine power to function, with the main power consumption due to drag from the gear train being immersed in the lubricating oil of the gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|Coasting with {{a vehicle}} not in gear is {{prohibited}} by law in most U.S. states. An example is Maine Revised Statutes Title 29-A, Chapter 19, §2064 [...] "An operator, when traveling on a downgrade, may not coast with the gears {{of the vehicle}} in neutral". Some regulations differ between commercial vehicles not <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> for downgrade, and passenger vehicles to set the transmission to neutral. This regulations point on how drivers operate a vehicle. Not using the engine on longer precipitous downgrade roads or permanent using the brake might cause a failure due overheating brakes.|$|R
40|$|Cables reeled in and {{out with}} less risk of tangling. Opposing teeth engage with {{clockwise}} rotation and disengage with clockwise rotation of crank. Driving plate moves axially with respect to driven plate on ball points <b>to</b> engage and <b>disengage.</b> <b>Clutch</b> developed for reeling and unreeling tether line used to link astronaut to space vehicle. Allows line pulled out freely and helps to prevent line from tangling in reel housing when crank is turned backward. New clutch concept also applicable to fishing reels, toys, and safety-line mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} clutch {{is used in}} some vehicles (e.g., mopeds) and also in other applications where {{the speed of the}} engine defines the state of the clutch, for example, in a chainsaw. This clutch system employs centrifugal force to automatically engage the clutch when the engine rpm rises above a threshold and <b>to</b> automatically <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> when the engine rpm falls low enough. See Saxomat and Variomatic.|$|R
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} <b>to</b> partially <b>disengage</b> or [...] "slip" [...] when {{the rear wheel}} tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> is adjustable to suit the application.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{stood on}} a {{platform}} with 10-inch tires and operated the machine using only the handlebars and steering column, pushing them forward to engage the clutch, using a lever on the handlebar to control the throttle, and pulling the handlebars and column back <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> and apply the brake. After riding, the steering column would be folded onto the platform to store the scooter more easily. The engine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, 155 cc engine over the front wheel. The bike came with a headlamp and tail lamp, a Klaxon horn, and a toolbox. Developed during wartime and gasoline rationing, it was quite efficient, but was not widely distributed. An electric version was also available with a motor on the front wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The main gun of the T-72 has a {{mean error}} of 1 m {{at a range}} of 1800 m. Its maximum firing {{distance}} is 9100 m, due to limited positive elevation. The limit of aimed fire is 4000 m (with the gun-launched anti-tank guided missile, which is rarely used outside the former USSR). The T-72's main gun is fitted with an integral pressure reserve drum, which assists in rapid smoke evacuation from the bore after firing. The 125 millimeter gun barrel is certified strong enough to ram the tank through forty centimeters of iron-reinforced brick wall, though doing so will negatively affect the gun's accuracy when subsequently fired. Rumours in NATO armies of the late Cold War claimed that the tremendous recoil of the huge 125 mm gun could damage the fully mechanical transmission of the T-72. The tank commander reputedly had to order firing by repeating his command, when the T-72 is on the move: [...] "Fire! Fire!" [...] The first shout supposedly allowed the driver <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> prevent wrecking the transmission when the gunner fired the cannon on the second order. In reality, this still-common tactic substantively improves the tank's firing accuracy and {{has nothing to do}} with recoil or mechanical damage to anything. This might have to do with the lower quality (compared to Western tanks) of the T-72's stabilizers.|$|R

50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before <b>disengaging</b> the <b>clutch.</b> When the <b>clutch</b> is <b>disengaged</b> and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> (with an over-center spring <b>to</b> hold the <b>clutch</b> <b>disengaged)</b> and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position <b>disengaged</b> the <b>clutch</b> and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|R

2500|$|A new [...] "E-stick" [...] option {{combined}} {{a manual}} 3-speed transmission {{with an automatic}} clutch as a low-cost alternative to the fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a clutch pedal by using engine oil pressure and intake manifold vacuum <b>to</b> engage and <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> when shifting gears.|$|R
50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{accelerator}} is released enough to slow the engine, engine braking comes into effect {{as long as the}} wheels remain connected via the transmission to the engine. A slipping or <b>disengaged</b> <b>clutch,</b> or a torque converter, would disengaged the wheels or absorb braking energy. The braking force varies depending on the engine, and the gear the transmission is in. The lower the gear, the higher the braking effect due to higher rpm and the torque transferred through the transmission (higher torque is delivered from the engine in lower gears).|$|R

50|$|A CODLAG system employs {{electric}} motors which {{are connected to}} the propeller shafts (usually 2). The motors are powered by diesel generators. For higher speeds, a gas turbine powers the shafts via a cross-connecting gearbox; for cruise speed, the drive train of the turbine is <b>disengaged</b> with <b>clutches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gliding is an {{energy-efficient}} driving operating mode of a motor vehicle, turning off the internal combustion engine when driving to save fuel. Coasting is disengaging the engine from the wheels in idle mode by <b>disengaging</b> the <b>clutch</b> or setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position, using the accelerated kinetic energy to keep the vehicle going, but lose speed {{to the existing}} drag. In hybrid electric vehicles this functionality {{is part of the}} concept and performed automatically by the engine controller. Vehicles with a conventional internal combustion engine, coasting can be performed manually, gliding when having a gear box. It is illegal in some states. An extra button to stop the engine was shown in 1979 on International Motor Show Germany, but newer standard in any vehicle. A so-called eClutch (electronic controlled clutch) uses an actuator to <b>disengage</b> the <b>clutch</b> when the driver leaved the accelerator.|$|R

50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. <b>To</b> <b>disengage</b> the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> the safety.|$|R
