25|$|The Government of Maharashtra, {{concerned}} about the highest total number of farmer suicides among its rural populations, commissioned its own study into reasons. At its behest, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai did field research and found the top causes of farmers suicides to be: debt, low income and crop failure, family issues such as illness and inability to pay celebration expenses for daughter's marriage, lack of <b>secondary</b> <b>income</b> occupations and lack of value-added opportunities.|$|E
25|$|How the {{distinction}} between productive and unproductive labor is drawn obviously has a big mathematical effect on the estimated total profit rate on production, if unproductive labor costs are excluded from the total variable capital outlay, and included {{in the part of}} total net output which represents total surplus value produced. If the proportion of unproductive labor increases, paradoxically the total surplus value will then also increase, with the effect of raising the rate of profit. Prof. Moseley resolves this paradoxical effect by distinguishing between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>income</b> distributions, and between gross and net surplus value. In his account, first the total net value-added is produced by the productive workers, and then the gross wages of the unproductive workers are deducted from the gross surplus value; in that interpretation, it follows that the larger the wage-bill of unproductive workers is, the lower the netted surplus value will be. Chris Harman noted large quantitative differences in the estimates of unproductive labor by different orthodox Marxists. Moseley's calculations and his definition of unproductive labor have been criticized by other Marxists. The main objections discussed are conceptual and empirical.|$|E

50|$|A {{similar study}} by Pires and Clarke {{suggests}} that campaigns to build national pride for the Psitaccines of Mexico could {{be effective in}} lowering trafficking rates, but they acknowledge that the campaign may not be successful due to Mexico’s large urban population and diversity of parrot species. A more comprehensive and concrete suggestion, also by Pires and Clarke, is to promote and invest in ecotourist lodges that partner with local communities in order to conserve Psittacine populations by using them to attract tourists who stimulate the local economy. If these lodges were effective in providing adequate support to surrounding communities, it is foreseeable that the parrot trade in those areas would decrease as opportunistic trappers realize the value of psittacines as a natural resource. Need based trapping would decline as primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>incomes</b> would become dependent on the ecotourism business.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of the development of aquaculture in the Philippines on the local economy, focusing on coastal fishers in two towns in Capiz and Iloilo, Panay Island, Philippines. Coastal residents in the two towns closely depend on fishing and aquaculture for both their primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>incomes.</b> The small-scale aquaculture business commenced by coastal fishermen has been expanding particularly after the 1990 s. The planting of mangrove trees is promoted and small-scale aquafarming is done by coastal fishermen who exert only small environmental loads. Small-scale aquaculture, including the aquaculture of shellfish, net cage culture, pen culture, and seaweed culture, requires low initial investment and imposes minimal workload on operators in terms of breeding management up to shipment, which is why most coastal fishing people want to continue in the business. On the other hand, pond culture, practiced before the 1990 s, promises no further rise in production for several reasons that include overproduction of milkfish and the outbreak of diseases in shrimp and prawn. Under these conditions, small-scale aquaculturists in two towns have established a sustainable aquaculture production system that allows them to maintain mangrove forests, utilize natural recirculation functions and help local residents obtain income.
