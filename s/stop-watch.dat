40|$|Winching {{is among}} the most common logging {{techniques}} in small-scale forestry, but it is inefficient and hard on the operators. The authors conducted a comparative test to determine the benefits of introducing an auxiliary winch that automatically returned the winch cable to the loading site. Such device would make it unnecessary for a crew member to walk down to the winch and pull the cable back to the loading site. The tests were conducted in central Italy, on the Tuscan hills. The study involved six volunteers, who were meant to cover a wide range of age and physical fitness characteristics and were considered representative of the regional logging workforce. Physiological workload was determined by measuring the operators’ heart rate for a half-day individual work session. Performance was determined by <b>stop-watching</b> all winching cycles, with and without the auxiliary winch. The auxiliary winch improved the efficiency of downhill winching, allowing operation by two workers only, instead of three. Winching cost decreased between 20 and 35 %, while physiological workload decreased between 7 and 30 %, depending on the operator...|$|R

6000|$|In {{this game}} {{any number of}} players, from fifteen to thirty, seat {{themselves}} in a heap on any one player, usually the player next to the dealer.

In fine, I could get nothing during three or four visits, but pretty positive assertions, expressions of wonder that I should affect to doubt what had been so often and so triumphantly proved to others, accounts physical and moral, like the one of which I had been the subject myself, and which did not admit of either confirmation or refutation, and often-repeated declarations, that the time was not distant when, in my own unworthy person, I was {{to become one of the}} most powerful magnetisers of the age.

6000|$|After {{waiting a}} few minutes by the little flag, Mrs. Glenarm saw the two men {{approaching}} her from the cottage. Dressed in a close-fitting costume, light and elastic, adapting itself to every movement, and made to answer every purpose required by the exercise {{in which he was}} abo ut to engage, Geoffrey's physical advantages showed themselves in their best and bravest aspect. His head sat proud and easy on his firm, white throat, bared to the air. The rising of his mighty chest, as he drew in deep draughts of the fragrant summer breeze; the play of his lithe and supple loins; the easy, elastic stride of his straight and shapely legs, presented a triumph of physical manhood in its highest type. Mrs. Glenarm's eyes devoured him in silent admiration. He looked like a young god of mythology--like a statue animated with color and life. [...] "Oh, Geoffrey!" [...] she exclaimed, softly, as he went by. He neither answered, nor looked: he had other business on hand than listening to soft nonsense. He was gathering himself up for the effort; his lips were set; his fists were lightly clenched. Perry posted himself at his place, grim and silent, with the watch in his hand. Geoffrey walked on beyond the flag, so as to give himself start enough to reach his full speed as he passed it. [...] "Now then!" [...] said Perry. In an instant more, he flew by (to Mrs. Glenarm's excited imagination) like an arrow from a bow. His action was perfect. His speed, at its utmost rate of exertion, preserved its rare underlying elements of strength and steadiness. Less and less and less he grew to the eyes that followed his course; still lightly flying over the ground, still firmly keeping the straight line. A moment more, and the runner vanished behind the wall of the cottage, and the <b>stop-watch</b> of the trainer returned to its place in his pocket.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature of}} the HP-55 was that it officially {{featured}} a <b>stop-watch</b> function much similar to the hidden <b>stop-watch</b> function of the earlier HP-45 calculator.

A quartz-crystal inside the calculator provided an accurate timebase, and it was advertised that the timer ran with as little as +/- 0.01% error. The data format used by the <b>stop-watch</b> consisted {{of a combination of}} units (Hours, Minutes and Seconds), but the HP-55 featured a special conversion function to convert between this format and a pure unit (Hours). Because of this, data from the <b>stop-watch</b> could easily be used right away in calculations.|$|E
50|$|A sound ranger used aural and <b>stop-watch</b> methods {{which first}} emerged before World War I. <b>Stop-watch</b> methods {{involved}} spotting a gun firing, measuring the bearing {{to it and}} the length of time it took the sound to arrive.

50|$|This was {{developed}} in the desire for a simpler method. The bed is connected to a wide-diameter u-tube containing a liquid such as kerosene. On pressurizing the space between the u-tube and the bed, the liquid is forced down. The level of liquid then acts as a measure of both pressure and volume flow. The liquid level rises as air leaks out through the bed. The time taken for the liquid level to pass between two pre-set marks on the tube is measured by <b>stop-watch.</b> The mean pressure and mean flowrate can be derived from the dimensions of the tube and the density of the liquid.|$|E
50|$|A Minkowski spacetime {{isometry}} has {{the property}} that {{the interval between}} events is left invariant. For example, if everything was postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go {{from one to the}} other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a <b>stop-watch</b> you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything was shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the proper length of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.|$|E

40|$|The four square {{step test}} (FSST) is {{commonly}} used to assess dynamic standing balance in elderly adult populations. To date, only the time (recorded by a <b>stop-watch)</b> to complete the test has been used. Other important dynamic balance information such as step velocity and step displacement can be extracted. This study re-examined the validity of recording the FSST time with a <b>stop-watch</b> by comparing it to a "gold standard" method (Vicon) and investigated the relationship between FSST <b>stop-watch</b> time and measures of step velocity, step displacement, and age. After familiarization, fourty-one healthy adults (42 ± 12 yrs.) completed three FSST trials. The FSST time was recorded by a <b>stop-watch</b> and the participants&# 039; foot movements were simultaneously recorded by a Vicon motion system (120 Hz). Measures extracted from the Vicon system were FSST time, step velocity (four directions) and step displacement (four directions). A paired t-test {{was used to compare}} FSST time recorded by each system. Pearson&# 039;s correlation analyses were conducted to identify relationships between measures. No significant difference was found between the FSST time recorded by the methods (mean differ-ence = 0. 02 ± 0. 11 s). Moreover, a strong positive linear rela-tionship (r = 0. 99, p &lt; 0. 0001) was found between the FSST time recorded by the methods. A moderate linear relationship was found between the FSST time (Vicon) and step velocity (r = 0. 67, p &lt; 0. 0001). Poor linear relationships were found be-tween (1) step velocity and step displacement, (2) FSST time (Vicon) and step displacement, (3) FSST time (both methods) and age, (4) age and step velocity, and (5) age and step dis-placement. In conclusion, the FSST <b>stop-watch</b> method is valid. Moreover, it may be used to predict step velocity but not step displacement.

40|$|The DSM-IV {{diagnostic}} criteria for premature ejaculation {{remain to be}} investigated by a clinical study. A prospective study was therefore conducted to investigate the DSM-IV definition and to provide an empirical operationalization of premature ejaculation. In this study 140 men suffering from lifelong premature ejaculation were interviewed separately from their partners. Various means of assessing the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) were compared: assessment by spontaneous answer, by questionnaire, by imagining foreplay and intercourse and estimating the ejaculation time without a clock or with a clock, and by <b>stop-watch</b> measurement at home over a one-month period. The number of thrusts and feelings of control during foreplay and intercourse were also assessed. A total of 110 men used the <b>stop-watch</b> method. Ninety {{percent of all the}} subjects ejaculated within one minute of intromission, with 80 % actually ejaculating within 30 seconds. The age of the men and duration of their relationship were not correlated with IELT; however, the IELT tended to be longer for couples who had a higher frequency of intercourse. There was only a moderate correlation between the various methods of assessing IELT.
