5000|$|They are pelagic fishes, fast {{swimmers}} and predatory in nature, {{that fight}} vigorously when caught. <b>Seerfishes</b> are mainly caught using hooks and lines. They are a delicacy in several regions of South India and Sri Lanka. In northern Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, this fish is called [...] "Vanjaram" [...] {{and is usually}} the costliest variety available. In Kerala, it is called [...] "Neymeen". It is called [...] "Aiykoora" [...] in northern Kerala and south coastal Karnataka. In Sri Lanka, it is known as [...] "thora". <b>Seerfishes</b> are {{also referred to as}} [...] "king mackerels" [...] in some areas. They have very sharp teeth and are handled with care by fishers familiar with them. The wahoo {{is one of the more}} popular in this group for eating. <b>Seerfishes</b> are notorious for their histamine poisoning. It can be fried, grilled, and steamed. It is gaining popularity in the South Pacific and United States as a canned product.|$|E

40|$|Longline is {{a static}} fishing gear {{consisting}} of many hooks, which are operated simultaneously for capturing carnivorous pelagic and demersal fishes. The fish catch can be optimised by selecting the hook with right {{shape and size}} (Huse and Ferno, 1990). Hook size and shape have to be optimised for the target species and size groups. In studies relating to longline fishing, {{it has often been}} shown that smaller hooks catch greater numbers of fish than larger hooks (Bjordal, 1989; Ralston, 1990). The line fishery is found to be very effective in exploiting large predator fishes, such as catfishes, elasmobranchs, tunnies, <b>seerfishes</b> and perches from uneven non-trawlable fishing grounds of coastal waters with coral or rocky outcrops (Jayasankar, 1990). The structure of longline used by the fishermen varies from place to place. In Thoothukudi coast, longline is used to catch <b>seerfishes,</b> perches, tuna, sharks and rays and this gear does not use sekiyama, snood wire and swivel in its construction. The present study was carried out for one year from June 2007 to May 2008 at Kombuthurai fishing village (lat. 8 ° 34 ’N, long. 78 ° 08 ’E), in Thoothukudi. Fishermen mainly engage longline fishing to catch <b>seerfishes</b> from vallam. The data on the seerfish landings and the longline fishing methods were collected from fishermen operating vallams. Data on species of seerfish, their total catch, length and weight were collected twice a week. Total weight was recorded using electronic balance available at the landing centre. Fishes landed were identified to species level following Fisher and Bianchi (1984). Selectivity of hooks for <b>seerfishes</b> in the longline fishery of Thoothukud...|$|E

40|$|The Indian tuna fishery {{comprises}} {{two distinct}} segments, the coastal fishery and the oceanic fishery. The main {{components of the}} coastal tuna fishery are the gillnet fishery around mainland India, in which different species of tunas and tunalike species occur, and the pole-and-line and troll line fisheries exploiting skipjack and young yellowfin tuna around the Lakshadweep Islands. The oceanic fishery uses exclusively longlines, targeting large deep-swimming yellowfin and bigeye tunas. The status of the coastal fishery was last reviewed by Pillai et al. (1995), {{and that of the}} oceanic fishery by Somvanshi and John (1995). The present paper gives an update of the national tuna fishery, both the coastal and oceanic segments, and its recent trends.

40|$|The <b>seerfishes</b> {{form one}} of the {{economically}} important groups of food fishes of Indian seas, of which Scomberomorus commerson and S. guttatus {{are the most important}} species.

However, according to Jones (1961) there is some mistake in the identity of the larval and juvenile stages worked out by Vijayaraghavan (op. cit.) and Kuthalingam (op. cit.) and so the food and feeding habits attributed to the larvae and juveniles by them cannot be taken as pertaining to those species.

Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012).

40|$|In the Indian Ocean, scombroids {{comprising}} of tunas, billfishes, <b>seerfishes</b> and mackerels are {{an invaluable}} resource and their producer value {{is estimated to}} between 2 and 3 billion US dollars annually, besides the vast socio-economic benefits to the fishing nations. Of the three major groups of species, tunas account for the largest share of the total catch and also for the largest increase during the past 10 years. Seerfish catches attained record levels in 1998 while billfish catches {{have more than doubled}} since 1992 although the relative contribution of the group is still small.

40|$|The {{literature}} on copepod parasites of fishes is profuse and ever increasing, and notable contributions which include parasitic copepods found on scombroid fishes are mainly {{to be found}} in the works of Brian (1906, 1935), Heller (1865), Kirtisinghe (1933 -), Leigh-Sharpe (1930), Pearse (1951, 1952), Scott and Scott (1913), Shiino (1952 -), Steenstrup and Lutken (1861), Wilson (1905 - 1944), Yamaguti (1936, 1939), and several others. A perusal of the literature shows that hardly a dozen species of copepod parasites have been described as new or recorded as occurring on scombroid fishes (mack_erels, <b>seerfishes</b> or Spanish mackerel, tunas and billfishes) found in the Indian seas, while at least 58 species appear to have been described or recorded (chiefly from eleven families of Caligoida and Lernaeopodoida) from scombroid fishes from various parts of the world.
