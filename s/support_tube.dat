40|$|Fluid-elastic {{instability}} of loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes,</b> vibrating in a tube-support-plate (TSP) inactive mode, is suspected {{to be one}} of the main causes of tube failure in some operating steam generators and heat exchangers. This report presents a mathematical model for fluid-elastic {{instability of}} loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes</b> exposed to non-uniform cross-flow. The model incorporates all motion-dependent fluid forces based on the unsteady flow theory. In the unstable region associated with a TSP-inactive mode, tube motion can be described by two linear models: TSP-inactive mode when tubes do not strike the TSP, and TSP-active mode when tubes do strike the TSP. A bilinear model (consisting of these linear models) presented in this report simulates the characteristics of fluid-elastic instability of loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes</b> in stable and unstable regions associated with TSP-inactive modes. Analytical results obtained with the model are compared with published experimental data; they agree reasonably well. The prediction procedure presented for fluid-elastic instability response of loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes</b> is applicable to the stable and unstable regions of the TSP-inactive mode...|$|R

40|$|A novel nanofibers-covered {{hollow fiber}} {{membrane}} (N-HFM) with high porosity (83. 5 %) was prepared via employing electrospinning to deposit nanofibers onto a porous <b>supporting</b> <b>tube.</b> Electrospun nanofibers covered on a porous <b>supporting</b> <b>tube</b> {{serve as the}} outer layer of the N-HFM. The <b>supporting</b> <b>tube</b> fixed on the soft electrode serves as the collector {{as well as the}} inner layer of the N-HFM. When the feeding rate was 1 ml L- 1, it was possible to continuously fabricate N-HFM with a non-rotational collector. The prepared N-HFM was used for desalination by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), and a high distillate flux of 17 kg m(- 2) h(- 1) was obtained while the feed and permeate temperatures were fixed at 333 K and 293 K, respectively. It is expected that the novel hollow fiber membranes with high porosity fabricated by this continuous electrospinning technique may be attractive in various separation and purification processes.
