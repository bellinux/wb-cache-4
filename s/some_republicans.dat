5|$|His {{political}} reputation {{rose with}} his professional plaudits. Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856. Two years later, <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> proposed Hayes {{to fill a}} vacancy {{on the bench and}} he considered accepting the appointment until the office of city solicitor also became vacant. The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy, and he won a full two-year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than other Republicans on the ticket.|$|E
5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E
5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's conservative base during that time. Late during his term as governor, he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues. Skeptics, including <b>some</b> <b>Republicans,</b> charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As a Mormon, he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E

5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|Taft had {{won over}} Root, {{who agreed to}} run for {{temporary}} chairman of the convention, and the delegates elected Root over Roosevelt's candidate. The Roosevelt forces moved to substitute the delegates they supported for the ones they argued should not be seated. Root made a crucial ruling, that although the contested delegates could not vote on their own seating, they could vote on the other contested delegates, a ruling that assured Taft's nomination, as the motion offered by the Roosevelt forces failed, 567â€”507. As it became clear Roosevelt would bolt the party if not nominated, <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> sought a compromise candidate to avert the electoral disaster to come; they were unsuccessful. Taft's name was placed in nomination by Warren Harding, whose attempts to praise Taft and unify the party were met with angry interruptions from progressives. Taft was nominated on the first ballot, though most Roosevelt delegates refused to vote.|$|E

5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. <b>Some</b> <b>Republicans</b> faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This {{was the first time in}} American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto. Despite this victory, even <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E

25|$|During the Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, he {{received}} the endorsement of prominent Obamacons, conservatives and Republicans who supported Obama. This was due to Bush's unpopularity. Despite receiving support from <b>some</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Obama ran {{to the left of}} Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Churchmen were {{appalled by}} the ruthlessness and cruelty. The Church's support for the Free State aroused bitter hostility among <b>some</b> <b>republicans.</b> Although the Catholic Church in {{independent}} Ireland has often {{been seen as a}} triumphalist Church, a recent study has found that it felt deeply insecure after these events.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012, Republican presidential {{candidate}} Rick Santorum was criticized by <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> delegates from Puerto Rico when he publicly took {{the position that}} Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking territory, {{should be required to}} make English its primary language as a condition of statehood.|$|R
25|$|As Bush lagged in {{the polls}} in the weeks {{preceding}} the August 1992 <b>Republican</b> National Convention, <b>some</b> <b>Republican</b> strategists (led by Secretary of State James Baker) viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement.

25|$|Founded today, the Netherlands {{would become}} a republic: <b>Some</b> <b>republicans</b> have argued, and some monarchists have acknowledged, that {{nowadays}} it would be logical or appropriate to choose a republican form of government {{if one were to}} found a new state, or the current royal family, Orange-Nassau, would decide to 'quit their jobs'.|$|E
25|$|The party opposes a government-run single-payer {{health care}} system, {{claiming}} {{such a system}} constitutes socialized medicine. While opposed to the Affordable Care Act and its requirement to buy insurance, <b>some</b> <b>Republicans</b> support some of its provisions, such as laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. The Republican Party has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs.|$|E
25|$|Many {{opinions}} {{were put}} {{forward for the}} defeat, some relating to perceived difficulties with the parliamentary appointment model, others relating {{to the lack of}} public engagement or that most Australians were simply happy to keep the status quo. <b>Some</b> <b>republicans</b> voted no because they did not agree with provisions such as the president being instantly dismissible by the prime minister.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Republican</b> leaders criticized Rahm Emanuel's {{appointment}} {{because they}} believed it went against Obama's promises to make politics less divisive, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat.
