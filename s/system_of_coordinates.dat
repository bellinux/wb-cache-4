It is now standard among all chess organizations and most books, magazines, and newspapers.

25|$|There {{is also a}} scientifique {{nomenclature}} {{offered to}} the spectator (the relativity of simultaneity), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name Einstein was not yet a household word in 1912, {{there has been a}} rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.|$|E

In 1943 the Capital Winze was sunk at 1400N and 214Fathom sublevels were driven north and south from it. Another winze at 530S was started, but suspended when it encountered quantities of water.|$|E

2500|$|Consider the {{following}} problem. [...] Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere S is {{given at the}} north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for parallel transport. [...] Naïvely, this could be done using a particular coordinate system. [...] However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinates</b> will not agree with that of another coordinate system. [...] A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation. [...] Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere {{in such a way}} that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling. [...] This latter means of parallel transport is the Levi-Civita connection on the sphere. [...] If two different curves are given with the same initial and terminal point, and a vector v is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the terminal point will be different from the vector resulting from rigidly moving v along the second curve. [...] This phenomenon reflects the curvature of the sphere. A simple mechanical device that can be used to visualize parallel transport is the south-pointing chariot.|$|E
