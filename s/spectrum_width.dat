50|$|The Doppler width, or Doppler <b>spectrum</b> <b>width,</b> is the {{standard}} deviation of the spectrum. Accordingly, small values stand for narrow spectra, while higher <b>spectrum</b> <b>width</b> corresponds to a bigger spreading of the hydrometeors over the velocity domain (frequency domain). Reasons for a higher width could be bi- or multiple-modal spectra. This means that the measured volume contains more than one hydrometeor population, which leads to two or more modes in the Doppler spectrum because of the different terminal velocities. A rapid change in Doppler width {{in combination with the}} mean Doppler velocity {{can also be used to}} separate two hydrometeor population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Coordination of {{co-located}} wireless devices is a fun-damental function/requirement {{for reducing}} interference. How-ever, different devices cannot directly coordinate {{with one another}} as they often use incompatible modulation schemes. Even for the same type (e. g., WiFi) of devices, their coordination is infeasible when neighboring transmitters adopt different <b>spectrum</b> <b>widths.</b> Such an incompatibility between heterogeneous devices may severely degrade the network performance. In this paper, we introduce Gap Sense (GSense), a novel mechanism that can coordinate heterogeneous devices without modifying their PHY-layer modulation schemes or <b>spectrum</b> <b>widths.</b> GSense prepends legacy packets with a customized preamble, which piggy-backs information to enhance inter-device coordination. The preamble leverages the quiet period between signal pulses to convey such information, and can be detected by neighboring nodes even when they have incompatible PHY layers. We have implemented and evaluated GSense on a software radio platform, demonstrating its significance and utility in three popular protocols. GSense is shown to deliver coordination information with close to 100 % accuracy within practical SNR regions. It can also reduce the energy consumption by around 44 %, and the collision rate by more than 88 % in networks of heterogeneous transmitters and receivers. I...|$|R

50|$|This {{parameter}} {{relates the}} location of the spectrum peak in respect to the mean spectrum value. Therefore, a positive skewness value indicates that the peak is located to the left with respect to the mean. A negative skewed spectrum has its peak on the right side with respect to the spectrum mean. A value around zero indicates a symmetric spectrum. In this way, the shape of a Doppler gives information on changes of cloud microphysics or of dynamical changes within the measured volume. The higher the elevation of the radar is, the higher are the dynamical influences on this parameter. Because wind shears lead to a broadening of the Doppler <b>spectrum</b> <b>width,</b> they can lead to rapid changes in skewness as well. To be able to relate the change in skewness of the Doppler spectrum, the Doppler width should be cross-checked as well.|$|E
