Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only {{began to change}} in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of North Sea oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial <b>services</b> <b>industry</b> and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E

In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Boston was ranked as having the ninth most competitive financial center {{in the world and}} the fourth most competitive in the United States. Boston-based Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States. The city is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center for venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing and publishing center—Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin's Press and Beacon Press. Pearson PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to three major convention centers—the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay, and the Seaport World Trade Center and Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. The General Electric Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company's global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut, citing factors including Boston's preeminence in the realm of higher education. Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear companies including Converse, New Balance, and Reebok. Rockport, PUMA and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices are located just outside the city.|$|E

Conclusions are as follow (1) The service economy in Gunma Prefecture shows a similar tendency to that in national economy, that has been lagging behind 15 years. It is said that the significance of <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> is not only its great employment impact but also creates market expansion for other industries. But in Gunma Prefecture, it is still the manufacturing industry that head the list of working population in 1996. (2) <b>Service</b> <b>industry</b> in the narrow sense is classified functionally in four groups-(1) personal <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> (<b>service</b> <b>industry</b> related to the life), (2) <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> related to the business, (3) leisure <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> and @ public <b>service</b> <b>industry.</b> In Gunma Prefecture, the component ratio of the above-mentioned four groups ac-counted for total working population are as the following in 1996,(1) 11. 4 %, (2) 21. 3 %, (3) 24. 2 %, (4) 43. 1 %. And the location quotient of four groups of <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> are as follows, (1) 1. 1,(2) 1. 3,(3) 0. 8,(4) 1. O. (3) Some parts of <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> have useful effects on the reproduction of our lifeprocess. And we can find that the sub-division of such <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> (medical care, social insurance, social welfare etc.) already developed rapidly through the Heisei stagnation period.

30|$|The modern <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> is an {{important}} component of the national economy, and accelerating the development of the modern <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> is {{an important}} way to expand domestic demand and transform the pattern of economic development. In general, the development of China's modern <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> is still at a low level, and current taxation system and policies are not conducive to its development. The pilot work of changing sales tax to a value-added tax (VAT) is of great importance to eliminating double taxation in the area of the modern <b>service</b> <b>industry,</b> reducing its tax burden, pushing manufacturing enterprises to voluntarily divest producer services, and increasing the supply of producer services. It is imperative to carry out the reform of changing sales tax to a VAT, but since the current VAT was designed based on the features of manufacturing, simple reproduction of it for the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> on which sales tax is currently levied is obviously too simple, for there are fundamental differences between the process of production and the operation of the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> and that of manufacturing. In manufacturing, production mainly relies on physical materials including raw materials, fuels, power, semi-manufactures, and so on, and in the current VAT system, after the deductions are made, the object of taxation is basically the added value of products. However, in the <b>service</b> <b>industry,</b> a great deal of production and operation does not rely primarily on the consumption of materials, but on that of non-material human capital and intangible assets including ‘taste,’ ‘originality,’ and so on (Gao 2012). If labor costs in the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> cannot be deducted, it is possible that the burden of some modern <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> would be heavier than that before the reform, which obviously runs counter to the intent of the reform. For the purpose of encouraging the development of the modern <b>service</b> <b>industry,</b> it has been suggested that intangible assets, human capital, and so on be included in the scope of VAT deduction as early as possible. In addition, there is no explicit instruction in the reform plan of ‘changing sales tax to VAT’ for tax exemption of service exports. Taxes are levied on service products exported from China and compared with the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> in countries where a VAT is levied on the <b>service</b> <b>industry,</b> the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> in China is in a disadvantageous position in the international market. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of China's <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> in the international market, especially in the producer services trade, specific measures and rules for the implementation of exempting, deducting and reimbursing taxes levied on the <b>service</b> <b>industry</b> must be worked out as soon as possible.|$|R
