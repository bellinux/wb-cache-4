5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection {{between himself and the}} other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.|$|E

40|$|This book {{is unique}} {{as the first}} effort to expound {{on the subject of}} <b>systematic</b> scaling <b>analysis.</b> Not written for a {{specific}} discipline, the book targets any reader interested in transport phenomena and reaction processes. The book is logically divided into chapters on the use of <b>systematic</b> scaling <b>analysis</b> in fluid dynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer, and reaction processes. An integrating chapter is included that considers more complex problems involving combined transport phenomena. Each chapter includes several problems that are explained in considerable detail. These are followed by several worked examples for which the general outline for the scaling is given. Each chapter also includes many practice problems. This book is based on recognizing the value of <b>systematic</b> scaling <b>analysis</b> as a pedagogical method for teaching transport and reaction processes and as a research tool for developing and solving models and in designing experiments. Thus, the book can serve as both a textbook and a reference book...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{significance}} of the combination of factor <b>analysis</b> and <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> in classification of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis, and to provide a scientific basis for the criterion of the classification. Methods: We designed a clinical questionnaire according to the clinical characteristics and the demands of traditional Chinese medical information collection for patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis. By means of clinical epidemiological research, with the four diagnosis methods for clinical information collection of traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms, physical signs, tongue conditions and pulse conditions in 310 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis were collected, and the characteristics of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in these patients were explored with statistical methods, such as factor <b>analysis,</b> varimax and <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis.</b> Results: Analyzed by factor <b>analysis</b> and <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> with SPSS 11. 0, the traditional Chinese medical syndromes in 287 of the 310 cases (92. 58 %) of posthepatitic cirrhosis could be classified. The syndromes could be divided into 7 categories, which were internal accumulation of damp-heat (55 cases), insufficiency of the spleen with overabundance of dampness (74 cases), accumulation of blood stasis plus deficiency of liver-yin and kidney-yin (73 cases), accumulation of blood stasis plus deficiency of both blood and qi (40 cases), deficiency of both blood and qi (16 cases), deficiency of yin and blood heat (6 cases) and stagnation of the liver-qi and deficiency of the spleen (23 cases). The traditional Chinese medical syndromes in the other 23 cases could not be classified. Conclusions: The clinical information collected with the four diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine can be classified into different categories with the factor <b>analysis</b> and <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis.</b> The factor <b>analysis</b> and <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> can reveal the characteristics and regularity of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis in a way, and have value in researching the syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine...|$|R

The Working Group furthermore performed a <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of kinematic data collected on fault surfaces (indications for type of movement and timing of the fault network). This resulted in a detailed framework for the deformation history of the Majella anticline, which shows the style of movement on various sets of faults and their relationships in time. In order to obtain a constraint on the type of stress field responsible for the deformations observed, a paleostress analysis using numerical inversion techniques was performed on the same kinematic data, and a palaeo-stress map was constructed.|$|E
