2500|$|Machine tools, which cut, grind {{and shape}} metal parts, were another {{important}} mechanical innovation of the Industrial Revolution. [...] Before machine tools it was prohibitively expensive to make precision parts, an essential requirement for many machines and interchangeable parts. [...] Historically important machine tools are the <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe, milling machine and metal planer (metalworking), which all came into use between 1800 and 1840. However, around 1900, {{it was the}} combination of small electric motors, specialty steels and new cutting and grinding materials that allowed machine tools to mass-produce steel parts. [...] Production of the Ford Model T required 32,000 machine tools.|$|E
60|$|The labours of the Railway Battalion and its {{officers}} did not {{end with}} {{the completion of the}} line to Abu Hamed. The Desert Railway was made. It had now to be maintained, worked, and rapidly extended. The terminus at Halfa had become a busy town. A mud village was transformed into a miniature Crewe. The great workshops that had grown with the line were equipped with diverse and elaborate machines. Plant of all kinds purchased in Cairo or requisitioned from England, with odds and ends collected from Ishmail's scrap heaps, filled the depots with an extraordinary variety of stores. Foundries, lathes, dynamos, steam-hammers, hydraulic presses, cupola furnaces, <b>screw-cutting</b> machines, and drills had been set up and were in continual work. They needed constant attention. Every appliance for repairing each must be provided. To haul the tonnage necessary to supply the army and extend the line nearly forty engines were eventually required. Purchased at different times and from different countries, they included ten distinct patterns; each pattern needed a special reserve of spare parts. The permutations and combinations of the stores were multiplied. Some of the engines were old and already worn out. These broke down periodically. The frictional parts of all were affected by the desert sand, and needed ceaseless attention and repair. The workshops were busy night and day for seven days a week.|$|E
60|$|While the Cetacea drifted {{slowly with}} the stream the yacht’s {{windlass}} began to clank, {{and a few}} minutes later she steamed toward the smaller craft. Her gig brought off a hawser, and a message inviting Jimmy to come on board. As soon as he reached her deck the gig was run up to the davits and the throb of engines quickened. The sloop, swinging into line astern, followed along the <b>screw-cut</b> wake, and in half an hour the fog-bank about the island faded out of sight.|$|R

50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as machine screws, wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point <b>screw-cutting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, {{the notion of}} a <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe stood in {{contrast}} to {{the notion of a}} regular lathe, which lacked the parts needed to guide the cutting tool in the precise path needed to produce an accurate thread. Since the early 19th century, it has been common practice to build these parts into any general-purpose metalworking lathe; thus, the distinction between [...] "regular lathe" [...] and [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] does not apply to the classification of modern lathes. Instead, there are other categories, some of which bundle single-point <b>screw-cutting</b> capability among other capabilities (for example, regular lathes, toolroom lathes, and CNC lathes), and some of which omit single-point <b>screw-cutting</b> capability as irrelevant to the machines' intended purposes (for example, speed lathes and turret lathes).|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, English {{instrument}} maker Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800) {{was working}} on the toolmaking and [...] end of the <b>screw-cutting</b> problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.|$|E
50|$|The first truly modern <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe {{was likely}} {{constructed}} by Jesse Ramsden in 1775. His device included a leadscrew, slide rest, and change gear mechanism. These form {{the elements of}} a modern (non-CNC) lathe and are in use to this day. Ramsden was able to use his first <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe to make even more accurate lathes. With these, he was able to make an exceptionally accurate dividing engine and in turn, some of the finest astronomical, surveying, and navigational instruments of the 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] {{carries a}} taxonomic {{qualification}} on its use—it {{is a term}} of historical classification rather than one of current commercial machine tool terminology. Early lathes, many centuries ago, were not adapted to <b>screw-cutting.</b> Later, from the Late Middle Ages until the early nineteenth century, some lathes were distinguishable as [...] "screw-cutting lathes" [...] because of the <b>screw-cutting</b> ability specially built into them. Since then, most metalworking lathes have this ability built in, {{but they are not}} called [...] "screw-cutting lathes" [...] in modern taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|Others followed. Examples were a French {{mechanic}} surnamed Senot, who in 1795 {{created a}} <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe capable of industrial-level production, and David Wilkinson of Vermont, who employed a slide rest in 1798. However, these inventors were soon overshadowed by Henry Maudslay, who in 1800 created a <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe that is frequently {{cited as the}} first. Clearly, his was not the first; however, his did become the best known, spreading {{to the rest of}} the world the winning combination of leadscrew, slide-rest, and change gears, in an arrangement practical to use and robust enough for cutting metal. These late-18th-century <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes represented the breakthrough development of the technology. They permitted the large-scale, industrial production of screws that were interchangeable. Standardization of threadforms (including thread angle, pitches, major diameters, pitch diameters, etc.) began immediately on the intra-company level, and by the end of the 19th century, it had been carried to the international level (although pluralities of standards still exist).|$|E
5000|$|Lathes of {{this size}} that are {{designed}} for mass manufacture, but not offering the versatile <b>screw-cutting</b> capabilities of the engine or bench lathe, {{are referred to as}} [...] "second operation" [...] lathes.|$|E
50|$|Lathes {{have been}} around since ancient times. Adapting them to <b>screw-cutting</b> is an obvious choice, but {{the problem of how}} to guide the cutting tool through the correct path was an {{obstacle}} for many centuries. Not until the late Middle Ages and early modern period did breakthroughs occur in this area; the earliest of which evidence exists today happened in the 15th century and is documented in the Mittelalterliche Hausbuch. It incorporates slide rests and a leadscrew. Roughly contemporarily, Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches showing various <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes and machines, one with two leadscrews. Leonardo also shows change-gears in some of these sketches.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe is {{a machine}} (specifically, a lathe) capable of cutting very {{accurate}} screw threads via single-point <b>screw-cutting,</b> {{which is the}} process of guiding the [...] motion of the tool bit in a precisely known ratio to the rotating motion of the workpiece. This is accomplished by gearing the leadscrew (which drives the tool bit's movement) to the spindle with a certain gear ratio for each thread pitch. Every degree of spindle rotation is matched by a certain distance of linear tool travel, depending on the desired thread pitch (English or metric, fine or coarse, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Among Donkin's other inventions were a <b>screw-cutting</b> and {{dividing}} machine; {{an instrument}} to measure the velocity of rotating machinery; and a counting engine. The last two received the Royal Society of Arts Prize medal.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{development}} of machine tools such as the <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe, metal planer, and milling machine, and of toolpath control via jigs and fixtures, provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making interchangeable parts a practical reality.|$|E
50|$|Maudslay {{developed}} the first industrially practical <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe in 1800, allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes {{for the first}} time.

50|$|Jesse Ramsden {{followed}} duc de Chaulnes by {{five years}} in the production of his dividing engine. As with the prior inventions, Ramsden's used a tangent screw mechanism to advance the machine from one position to another. However, he had developed a <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe that was particularly advanced and produced a superior product. This engine was developed with funding from the Board of Longitude on condition that it be described in detail (along with the related <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe) and not be protected by patent. This allowed others to freely copy the device and improve on it. In fact, the Board required that he teach others to construct their own copies and make his dividing engine available to graduate instruments made by others.|$|E
50|$|Henry Hindley {{designed}} and constructed a <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe circa 1739. It featured a plate guiding the tool and power supplied by a hand-cranked series of gears. By changing the gears, he could cut screws with different pitch. Removing a gear permitted {{him to make}} left-handed threads.|$|E

50|$|Maudslay laid an {{important}} {{foundation for the}} Industrial Revolution with his machine tool technology. His most influential invention was the <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe.

50|$|Screws {{were used}} in the 15th century to {{construct}} <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes, for securing breastplates, backplates, and helmets on medieval jousting armor—and eventually for multiple parts of the emerging firearms, particularly the matchlock. Screws, hence screwdrivers, were not used in full combat armor, most likely to give the wearer freedom of movement.|$|E
50|$|Before the Industrial Revolution {{the foot}} lathe has been use {{for many years}} for turning both wood and metals (see image B). Perrigo {{mentioned}} he build such a lathe himself, when he was between fifteen and sixteen years of age. An 18th century new development for lathes {{was the idea of}} <b>screw-cutting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of standards in industry and commerce became highly important {{with the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts. Henry Maudslay developed the first industrially practical <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe in 1800, which allowed for the standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Center gauges and {{fishtail}} gauges are gauges used in lathe {{work for}} checking the angles when grinding the profiles of single-point <b>screw-cutting</b> tool bits and centers. In the image, the gauge {{on the left}} is called a fishtail gauge or center gauge, and the one on the right is another style of center gauge.|$|E
50|$|A {{split nut}} {{assembly}} {{is often used}} in positioning systems, for example in the leadscrew of a lathe. It {{is one of the}} machine elements that makes single-point threading practical on manual (non-CNC) lathes. The very earliest <b>screw-cutting</b> lathes (in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) did not have them, but within a few decades, split nuts were common on lathes.|$|E
50|$|Henry Hindley (1701-1771) was an 18th-century clockmaker, watchmaker and {{maker of}} {{scientific}} instruments. He invented a <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe, a fuse-cutting engine and an improved wheel-cutting engine and {{made one of}} the first dividing engines, for the construction of accurately-graduated arcs on scientific instruments. He is thought to have made the world's first equatorially-mounted telescope, which can now be seen in Burton Constable Hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{ornamental}} {{turning lathe}} was developed {{around the same}} time as the industrial <b>screw-cutting</b> lathe in the nineteenth century. It was used not for making practical objects, but for decorative work - ornamental turning. By using accessories such as the horizontal and vertical cutting frames, eccentric chuck and elliptical chuck, solids of extraordinary complexity may be produced by various generative procedures.|$|E
