40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{providing}} inference for <b>parameters</b> <b>selected</b> after viewing the data. A frequentist solution to this problem is using False Discovery Rate controlling multiple testing procedures to <b>select</b> the <b>parameters</b> and constructing False Coverage-statement Rate adjusted confidence intervals for the <b>selected</b> <b>parameters.</b> We argue that selection also affects Bayesian inference and present a Bayesian framework for providing inference for <b>selected</b> <b>parameters.</b> We explain the role of selection in controlling the occurrence of false discoveries in Bayesian analysis and demonstrate how to specify selection criteria. We explain the relation between our Bayesian approach and the Bayesian FDR approach. We apply our new approach to microarray data...|$|R

50|$|The AX80 has knobs for master {{volume and}} tuning, and a data entry knob {{that can be}} used to alter the {{currently}} <b>selected</b> <b>parameter</b> in real-time, although the value will jump to the knob's current position. There are various switches to select modulation destinations controlled by the modulation wheel (filter and pitch), to enable chord memory or infinite sustain of notes, and to select or edit sounds. The pitch-bend and modulation wheels also have knobs governing the depth of the effect of each. Footswitches can control sustain or switch sounds by moving up one patch at a time.|$|E
50|$|When facing both {{multiplicity}} (inference about multiple parameters) and selection, {{not only}} is the expected proportion of coverage over selected parameters at 1−α not equivalent to the expected proportion of no coverage at α, but also the latter can no longer be ensured by constructing marginal CIs for each <b>selected</b> <b>parameter.</b> FCR procedures solve this by taking the expected proportion of parameters not covered by their CIs among the selected parameters, where the proportion is 0 if no parameter is selected. This false coverage-statement rate (FCR) is a property of any procedure that is defined by the way in which parameters are selected {{and the way in which}} the multiple intervals are constructed.|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} to mitigation originally suggested by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, expanded upon by others, and applied in real-life situations, is Reference class forecasting. This approach involves three steps: {{with a specific}} project in mind, identify a number of past projects that share {{a large number of}} elements with the project under scrutiny; for this group of projects, establish a probability distribution of the parameter that is being forecast; and, compare the specific project with the group of similar projects, in order to establish the most likely value of the <b>selected</b> <b>parameter</b> for the specific project. This simply stated method masks potential complexity regarding application to real-life projects: few projects are characterizable by a single parameter; multiple parameters exponentially complicates the process; gathering sufficient data on which to build robust probability distributions is problematic; and, project outcomes are rarely unambiguous and their reportage is often skewed by stakeholders' interests. Nonetheless, this approach has merit as part of a Cognitive Bias Mitigation protocol when the process is applied with a maximum of diligence, in situations where good data is available and all stakeholders can be expected to cooperate.|$|E
