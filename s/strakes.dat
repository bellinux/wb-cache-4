The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E

50|$|<b>Strake’s</b> father, George <b>Strake</b> Sr., {{was born}} in St. Louis, {{graduated}} from St. Louis University, served in the Army Air Corp in World War I, went to Tampico, Mexico and later Havana, Cuba, {{to work in the}} oil business. He was orphaned at the age of seven. In 1929, he came virtually penniless to Houston, the home of his wife, Susan Kehoe <b>Strake.</b> He toured the back roads of East Texas in search of an oil-bearing formation. In 1930, he followed a creek bed outside Conroe, Texas, where he found the particular formation he was seeking. Soon two oil wells came to fruition, and <b>Strake,</b> a devout Roman Catholic, became the third wealthiest oilman in Houston. <b>Strake</b> Jr., joined his father in the management of the G.W. <b>Strake</b> Company petroleum holdings. After his father’s death in 1969, he became an independent oil and gas operator. He later formed related businesses: <b>Strake</b> Trading Group, <b>Strake</b> Consortium (Yemen) Limited and <b>Strake</b> Management Company.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe modern high {{performance}} air vehicles {{are required to}} have extreme maneuverability, which includes the ability of controlled maneuvers at high angle of attack. However, the nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic phenomena, such as flow separation, vortices interaction, and vortices breaking down, will occur during the flight at high angle of attack, which could induce the uncommanded motions for the air vehicles. For the high maneuverable and agile air missile, the nonlinear roll motions would occur at the high angle of attack. The present work {{is focused on the}} self-induced nonlinear roll motion for a missile configuration and discusses the influence of the <b>strake</b> wings on the roll motion according to the results from free-to-roll test and PIV measurement using the models assembled with different <b>strake</b> wings at α= 60 °. The free-to-roll results show that the model with whole <b>strake</b> wings (baseline), the model assembled with three <b>strake</b> wings (Case A) and the model assembled with two opposite <b>strake</b> wings (Case C) experience the spinning, while the model assembled with two adjacent <b>strake</b> wings (Case B), the model assembled with one <b>strake</b> wing (Case D) and the model with no <b>strake</b> wing (Case E) trim or slightly vibrate at a certain “×” rolling angle, which mean that the rolling stability can be improved by dismantling certain <b>strake</b> wings. The flow field results from PIV measurement show that the leeward asymmetric vortices are induced by the windward <b>strake</b> wings. The vortices would interact the <b>strake</b> wings and induce crossflow on the downstream fins to degrade the rolling stability of the model. This could be the main reason for the self-induced roll motion of the model at α= 60 °...|$|R
25|$|Related to {{the steam}} {{traction}} engine, the steam roller {{was used for}} road building and flattening ground. Typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing the front wheels and axle, and smooth rear wheels without <b>strakes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The High Alpha (angle of attack) Research Vehicle was an American {{modified}} McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet used by NASA in a 3-phase program investigating {{controlled flight}} at high angles of attack using thrust vectoring, {{modifications to the}} flight controls, and with actuated forebody <b>strakes.</b> The program lasted from April 1987 to September 1996.|$|E
25|$|These styling {{changes were}} unpopular with many—particularly {{features}} such as the fin <b>strakes</b> within the primary rear-intake-ducts openings, which appeared to mimic the Ferrari Testarossa, though providing crucial improved engine cooling. Nonetheless it was only outsold by the QV model. It continued to featured 345/35R15 tyres. The Anniversary edition was produced up until 1990 before being superseded by the Lamborghini Diablo.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the design}} of a <b>strake</b> for a forebody typical of supersonic aircraft at typical cruise (low lift) conditions, in order to ensure attached flow on the <b>strake</b> upper surface. The method systematically varies <b>strake</b> camber and thickness until an attached flow surface pressure distribution is achieved. Surface pressures are computed by the full potential flow solver, NCOREL. The high-alpha flowfield of the <b>strake</b> is also investigated experimentally and computationally; a large vortex is noted on the <b>strake</b> leeside, together with a pair of vortices on the forebody upper centerline. The effect of sideslip on the high-alpha flowfield is also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The initial {{prototype}} crashed during spin tests. Later prototypes had new features to improve handling, including long <b>strakes</b> along the nose, and an extensively redesigned and enlarged tail. After these modifications, the USAF found the aircraft acceptable to their needs, and ordered it into production as the T-37A. Production aircraft remained tricky in {{recovering from a}} spin; the recovery procedure was complex compared with most aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The J-20 has a {{long and}} wide fuselage, with the chiseled nose section and a {{frameless}} canopy resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral <b>strakes,</b> and conventional round engine exhausts.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{aftermarket}} modifications and upgrades {{are available}} for 200 and 300 Series King Airs. One company offers a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for 200 Series aircraft and a modification to replace the electro-mechanical landing gear retraction system of early-build aircraft with an electro-hydraulic system.

40|$|Interaction of <b>strake</b> and wing {{vortices}} over a 70 ◦/ 50 ◦double {{delta wing}} were studied experimentally in a wind tunnel using particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The upstream {{effect of the}} wing vortex on {{the formation of the}} <b>strake</b> vortex was identified. A dual-vortex structure of the <b>strake</b> vortices was observed before the wing vortex developed. Further downstream, wing and <b>strake</b> vortices rotated around each other slowly initially, and then faster with downstream distance, at an increasing rate with increasing incidence. Prior to vortex breakdown, both wing and <b>strake</b> vortices were found meandering in relatively small regions. The correlation between the instantaneous locations of the vortices increases if the vortices become sufficiently close to each other. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis of the instantaneous velocity fields suggested that, for both wing and <b>strake</b> vortices, the most energetic mode was displacement in the first helical mode. The most energetic mode reveals out-of-phase displacements when the vortices are close to each other...|$|R
25|$|The {{nose wheel}} was located aft of the intake and {{retracted}} rearwards, with the light-weight main gear {{mounted on the}} fuselage. A sharply swept vertical tail was mounted on a spine {{on top of the}} rear fuselage, and was supplemented by two steeply canted ventral <b>strakes,</b> mounted on the ends of the wing root fillets. Composites, used in 22% of the airframe, allowed aerolastic tailoring to the wings. They were used also in the vertical tail, the canards, and various doors and panels. IAI claimed a significant reduction in radar cross section.|$|E
25|$|The Antonov OKB {{set about}} {{rectifying}} these faults with increased-area {{vertical and horizontal}} tail surfaces, anti-spin <b>strakes</b> on the upper rear fuselage sides, deleting the wing LE slats, local structural reinforcements and replacing the TV-2 engines with Ivchenko AI-20D turboprop engines, which had {{the added benefit of}} reducing the empty weight by three tonnes (6,600lb). The new design required the use of new production techniques, such as stamping and forging of large high-strength parts, extrusion of long sections, chemical milling of large skin panels and other new techniques.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{designated}} a stealth fighter, measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect. An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal {{the front of the}} jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept, so will reflect radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and <b>strakes.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{behavior of}} engine nacelle <b>strake</b> when subjected to unsteady aerodynamic flows is investigated in this paper. Geometric nonlinear characteristics and modal parameters of nacelle <b>strake</b> are studied {{when it is}} under dynamic loading condition. Here, an N-S based Finite Volume solver is coupled with Finite Element (FE) based nonlinear structural solver to investigate the nonlinear characteristics of nacelle <b>strake</b> over a range of dynamic pressures at various phases of flight like takeoff, climb, and cruise conditions. The combination of high fidelity models for both aerodynamics and structural dynamics is used to predict the nonlinearities of <b>strake</b> (chine). The methodology adopted for present aeroelastic analysis is partitioned-based time domain coupled CFD and CSD solvers and it is validated by the consideration of experimental and numerical comparison of aeroelastic data for a cropped delta wing model which has a proven record. The present <b>strake</b> geometry is derived from theoretical formulation. The amplitude and frequency obtained from the coupled solver at various dynamic pressures is discussed, which gives {{a better understanding of}} its impact on aerodynamic design-sizing of <b>strake...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{presentation}} is to discuss the integration effects of turboprop nacelles on a high-lift wing with an internally blowing plain ﬂap system with Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes computations. It is shown that the resulting nacelle vortices can signiﬁcantly reduce the maximum angle of attack and maximum lift coefﬁcient at zero thrust conditions. In order to limit the negative impact, an inboard nacelle <b>strake</b> was designed {{with the aim of}} maximizing the lift coefﬁcient of the landing conﬁguration at zero thrust. To reach this goal, a sensitivity study on basic geometric <b>strake</b> parameters was carried out. The best nacelle <b>strake</b> is able to improve the maximum lift coefﬁcient by 17 lift counts and the maximum angle of attack by three degrees. The study also revealed further potential of improvement due to an outboard <b>strake.</b> Using an outboard <b>strake,</b> which is not properly designed but simply mirrored from the inboard one leads to an additional improvement of 13 lift counts and 4 degrees in maximum angle of attack. Furthermore, it is shown that the installation of an inboard <b>strake</b> does not negatively impact the high-lift performance at a moderate thrust level...|$|R

25|$|The {{hatchback}} {{was dropped}} for 1980, {{as was the}} old three-speed manual transmission. Remaining Concord models were given a smoother appearance. The sedan versions of the D/L and Limited were given full vinyl roofs with nearly triangular opera windows embedded in the C-pillars; the coupe versions received squared off opera windows, and revised chrome opera window trim with vertical <b>strakes</b> occupying {{the space between the}} window itself and the outer piece of trim. Limited wagons received blackout paint and chrome trim surrounding their rear quarter windows. Base sedans and coupes retained the same rooflines and treatment seen on Hornets since 1970. Taillights were modified and given a wraparound treatment reminiscent of the old Hornet. All Concords received a new horizontal bar grille, with the Concord name in script to the driver's side, and a new, squared-off hood ornament bearing the AMC tri-color logo. That same year, options such as power windows and power seats were also made available.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel was}} built by a method of {{construction}} known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame-first construction. The keel, extended by a long fore foot ending with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by mortise (10 to 12cm deep and 8cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22cm long, 8cm wide, and 1.5cm thick), construction to three <b>strakes.</b> This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, {{the rest of the}} framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the upper shell (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive cutwater, over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame.|$|E
