Regression analysis revealed that gender, level of education, frequencies of attending <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> using smartphones and tablets, as well as purposes of using <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> for fun and school or work, account for about 33 % of the variances in the frequencies of activities on <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites.</b> The findings indicated that men tend to conduct activities on <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> more often than women and users {{with lower levels of}} education tend to also be more active on <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites.</b> Frequent attending <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> from smartphones and tablets predicted even more frequent activities on these sites and likewise the using of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> for fun and school or work.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> are {{extremely}} popular online destinations that offer users {{easy ways to}} build and maintain relationships with each other, and to disseminate information in an activity referred to as <b>social</b> <b>networking.</b> Students, lecturers, teachers, parents and businesses, in increasing numbers, use tools available on <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> {{to communicate with each}} other in a fast and cost-effective manner. The use of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>sites</b> to support educational initiatives has received much attention. However, the full potential of social network sites has yet to be achieved as users continue to strive for optimal ways of using these sites, as well as battle to overcome the negative characteristics (for example, privacy, security, governance, user behaviour, information quality) of these sites.
