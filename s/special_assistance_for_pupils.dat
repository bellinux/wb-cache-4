Tilgangurinn er að veita innsýn í störf ráðanna og draga lærdóm af niðurstöðum en einnig að vekja lesendur til umhugsunar um réttindastöðu grunnskólanemenda. Vaxandi skilningur er á mikilvægi þess að rödd barna fái hljómgrunn, að á þau sé hlustað og að þess sjáist merki við ákvörðunartöku í málum þar sem aðstæður þeirra og vandi eru til meðferðar. Nemendaverndarráð eru þverfagleg teymi sem eiga að starfa í grunnskólum landsins og þeim er ætlað að stuðla að velferð nemenda. Starfsemi þeirra hefur lítt verið rannsökuð og ekki hafa legið fyrir upplýsingar um þátttöku barna í meðferð mála sem tekin eru fyrir þar. Rafrænn spurningalisti var sendur til skólastjóra allra grunnskóla á Íslandi skóla- árið 2013 – 2014. Alls bárust svör frá 84 skólum og var svarhlutfall 50 % á landsvísu. Niðurstöður benda til þess að nemendaverndarráð starfi í flestum grunnskólum og töldu þátttakendur þau almennt starfa með hagsmuni nemenda að leiðarljósi. Mál sem rata inn á borð nemendaverndarráða eiga það flest sameiginlegt að fjalla um málefni einstakra nemenda en hlutdeild nemenda í afgreiðslu mála sem þá snerta er takmörkuð. Þátttakendur töldu aldur og þroska nemenda og eðli mála helstu ástæður lítillar aðkomu nemendanna sjálfra. Meirihluta foreldra (86 %) er tilkynnt að um mál barns þeirra sé fjallað í ráðunum en hlutfallslega fáum börnum er gert við- vart um það (17 %). Niðurstöður benda til að tryggja þurfi betur hlutdeild nemenda í ákvörðunum um eigin málefni í nemendaverndarráðunum. The aim of {{the study}} {{reported}} here was to examine the practice of pupils’ welfare councils in compulsory schools, and participation of children in decision-making in their own educational affairs, which are seen holistically and include health and safety issues. The purpose was to provide insight into the practices of pupils’ welfare councils and to learn from the results as well as to increase awareness of rights of children. There is an increasing understanding of the importance of listening to children, for them be heard and engaged in decision making in their own affairs while planning and managing adequate responses and services. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as laws and regulations regarding pupils´ welfare and the national curriculum´s fundamental pillars focus on democracy and human rights, were used as guidelines when conducting this study. In addition, the perspective of recent childhood studies, where children are looked upon as active and autonomous individuals, was also used as reference. Pupils’ welfare councils (hereafter PWCs) are multidisciplinary teams that are legally mandated to operate in compulsory schools in Iceland and are intended to promote and safeguard children’s and young people’s welfare in schooling. The role of PWCs is to coordinate and manage services <b>for</b> <b>pupils</b> in school health services, school counselling and inclusive education and to assist headmasters in managing plans regarding <b>special</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> individual <b>pupils</b> as well as promoting preventative measures. Involvement of children and young people in decision making in the PWCs is not statuted in the Compulsory School Act even though they are, according to the Children Act, entitled to express their opinions on all matters regarding them and fair consideration shall be given to their opinions in accordance to their age and maturity. The practice of the PWCs is under researched and no information can be found about the participation of pupils in affairs related to their individual case handling. Quantitative research methods were used in this study. During the school year 2013 – 2014 an electronic questionnaire was sent to all compulsory school principals in Iceland. There were responses from 84 schools, with a response rate of 50 %. Results indicate that there are PWCs in place in most schools and participants felt that they generally operate {{in the best interests of}} students. Most issues that find their way into the PWCs have in common matters concerning individual children, but pupils’ involvement in decision making and handling of matters concerning themselves showed to be limited. The participants mentioned age, maturity of pupils and different nature of affairs as the main reasons for the infrequent involvement of children. Majority of parents (86 %) are notified about the case handlings of their children’s affairs in the councils but only a small percentage of pupils are made aware of it (17 %). In light of other studies of wishes, competence and the mandated rights of children these results indicate the need for more involvement of school children in decisions about their own affairs in pupil welfare councils. Lack of management guidelines concerning the case handlings was found in the participants´ answers when asked about the work of practices and also in the keeping of records and minutes. Results indicate that more emphasis should be on establishing such rules. This would enhance each council’s proceedings during their work. To promote success and effective development of pupil welfare councils it is important to have a thorough knowledge of current activities, and results of this study provide that needed overview...|$|R

The diploma work presented learning difficulties, which are broadly divides into general and specific. Pupils with specific learning difficulties are included at educational program with additional assistnace. Additional assistance is implemented by teacher for children with special needs or pedagogs or social pedagogs, who have an extra knowledge. The diploma work is focused on teacher for children with special needs and his role in additional <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> <b>pupils</b> with learning difficulties and role of puppets.

5000|$|The {{educational}} {{philosophy that}} was the foundation upon which the <b>Special</b> <b>Assistance</b> Program was built had its origins in these reports. That philosophy recognises the profound influence that a child's learning environment has on his behaviour and learning. It also acknowledges the right of children to have their learning needs met in common structural and social conditions. Arising from this philosophical perspective emerges the inescapable proposition that <b>special</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy (over and above the normnal learning provisions available to all children) {{is an essential part}} of a school's functioning and that the designation of a specially trained resource teacher to provide that assistance to children, their classroom teachers and their parents is an integral part of a team approach to curriculum development, teaching and all other aspects of schooling. This position was strongly supported by both the Australian Schools Commission's Report for the Triennium 1976-78 and the Warnock Report, which went further to assert that if ordinary schools are to improve in their efforts for children with special needs they will require special support from within their organisation.|$|R

This {{was due to the}} allocation method: funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the large proportion of such students in the Arab sector, they receive less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index. Ministry data on the percentage of high school students who passed their matriculation exams showed that Arab towns were ranked lowest except for Fureidis, which had the third highest pass rate (75.86 percent) in Israel.|$|R
