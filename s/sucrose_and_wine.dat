40|$|Vacuoles were {{isolated}} from freshly cut slices of the storage roots of beetroot (Beta vulgaris), and from slices {{that had been}} washed in aerated water for 1 - 3 days. The unique vacuolar location of betanin permitted {{the use of a}} correlative method to determine whether <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> acid invertase were located in the vacuoles. The specific content (the activity of the enzyme or amount of substrate per mg of protein) and the percentage recoveries for betanin, <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> acid invertase were determined for the different fractions obtained during the isolation of the vacuoles. For each fraction the specific content of betanin was plotted against those of <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> acid invertase. Similar correlative plots were drawn for the percentage recoveries. For both specific contents and percentage recoveries for correlation coefficients for <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> for acid invertase versus betanin were close to unity, and the lines passed near the origins. It is concluded that, in beetroot, most of the <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> much of the acid invertase are in the vacuoles. Measurements of vacuolar <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> acid invertase in beetroot slices washed for 1 - 3 days demonstrated an inverse relationship between <b>sucrose</b> content <b>and</b> acid invertase activity...|$|R

40|$|Choice between <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> wheel-running {{reinforcement}} {{was assessed}} in two experiments. In the first experiment, ten male Wistar rats {{were exposed to}} concurrent VI 30  s VI 30  s schedules of wheel-running <b>and</b> <b>sucrose</b> reinforcement. Sucrose concentration varied across concentrations of 2. 5, 7. 5, and 12. 5 %. As concentration increased, more behavior was allocated to <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> more reinforcements were obtained from that alternative. Allocation of behavior to wheel running decreased, but obtained wheel-running reinforcement did not change. Overall, the results suggested that food-deprived rats were sensitive to qualitative changes in food supply (sucrose concentration) while continuing to defend a level of physical activity (wheel running). In the second study, 15 female Long Evans rats were exposed to concurrent variable ratio schedules of <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> wheel-running, wheel-running <b>and</b> wheel-running, <b>and</b> <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> <b>sucrose</b> reinforcement. For each pair of reinforcers, substitutability was assessed by the effect of income-compensated price changes on consumption of the two reinforcers. Results showed that, as expected, sucrose substituted for <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> wheel running substituted for wheel running. Wheel running, however, did not substitute for sucrose; but sucrose partially substituted for wheel running.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of osmolytes, <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> trehalose, on the deterioration of hen lysozyme as a model protein. <b>Sucrose</b> <b>and</b> trehalose depressed the aggregation of lyso-zyme molecules caused by heating at 100 °C at pH 6. Since lysozyme was fully denatured under these conditions, the effects of <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> trehalose on the denatured state of lysozyme were investigated using reduced S-alkylated lysozyme, a model of denatured hen lysozyme. From analyses of circular dichroism spectra <b>and</b> fluorescence spectra, <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> trehalose were found to induce a-helical conformations and some tertiary structures around tryptophan residues in the reduced S-alkylated lysozyme. Moreover, these compounds also depressed chemical reactions such as deamidation and racemiza-tion, which often cause the deterioration of proteins, on the reduced S-alkylated lyso-zyme. Therefore, the data suggest that <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> trehalose have a propensity to de-press such deterioration as the aggregation of protein molecules or chemical reactions in proteins by inducing some tertiary structures (including a-helical structures) in the polypeptide chain. Key words: aggregation, deamidation, hen lysozyme, racemization, sucrose, trehalose...|$|R

40|$|Trichosporon cutaneum {{is shown}} to utilize six disaccharides, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, <b>sucrose,</b> melibiose, <b>and</b> trehalose. T. cutaneum can thus be counted with the rather {{restricted}} group of yeasts (11 to 12 % of all investigated) which can utilize lactose and melibiose. The half-saturation constants for uptake were 10 +/- 3 mM <b>sucrose</b> or lactose <b>and</b> 5 +/- 1 mM maltose, which is of the same order of magnitude as those reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results indicate that maltose shares a common transport system with <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> {{that there may be}} some interaction between the uptake systems for lactose, cellobiose, and glucose. Lactose, cellobiose, and melibiose are hydrolyzed by cell wall-bound glycosidase(s), suggesting hydrolysis before or in connection with uptake. In contrast, maltose, <b>sucrose,</b> <b>and</b> trehalose seem to be taken up as such. The uptake of <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> lactose is dependent on a proton gradient across the cell membrane. In contrast, there were no indications of the involvement of gradients of H+, K+, or Na+ in the uptake of maltose. The uptake of lactose is to a large extent inducible, as is the corresponding glycosidase. Also the glycosidases for cellobiose, trehalose, and melibiose are inducible.

40|$|Embryos {{of wheat}} {Triticum aestivum L. cv.

Starch accumulated in axes and scutella from about 20 d post anthesis (dpa) to reach a max-imum at approximately 35 d. The starch content then declined to a very low value in late maturation. Extractable a-amylase activity increased in embryos throughout the period of starch deposition and showed a substantial rise coincident with starch breakdown. In early maturation (approximately 26 dpa) <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> raffinose appeared, and continued to increase. The rise {{in the amount of}} sucrose paralleled the accumula-tion of starch, but the major increase in raffinose approximated to the fall in starch content.

40|$|Anthocyanins are {{secondary}} metabolites, which play {{an important}} role in the physiology of plants. Both <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> hormones regulate anthocyanin synthesis. Here, the interplay between <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> plant hormones was investigated in the expression of sucrose-regulated genes coding for anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes in Arabidopsis seedlings. • The expression pattern of 14 genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, including two transcription factors (PAP 1, PAP 2), was analysed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Arabidopsis seedlings treated with <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> plant hormones. • Sucrose-induction of the anthocyanin synthesis pathway was repressed by the addition of gibberellic acid (GA) whereas jasmonate (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) had a synergic effect with sucrose. The gai mutant was less sensitive to GA-dependent repression of dihydroflavonol reductase. This would seem to prove that GAI signalling is involved in the crosstalk between <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> GA in wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings. Conversely, the inductive effect of sucrose was not strictly ABA mediated. Sucrose induction of anthocyanin genes required the COI 1 gene, but not JAR 1, which suggests a possible convergence of the jasmonate- and sucrose-signalling pathways. • The results suggest the existence of a crosstalk between the <b>sucrose</b> <b>and</b> hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway...|$|R
