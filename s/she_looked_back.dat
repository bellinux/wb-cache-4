500|$|Élisabeth de Gramont, the Duchess of Clermont-Tonnerre, was {{a writer}} {{best known for her}} popular memoirs. A {{descendant}} of Henry IV of France, she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, [...] "peasants on her farm... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses". <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on this lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the [...] "red duchess" [...] for her support of socialism. [...] She was married and had two daughters in 1910, when she met Barney; her husband {{is said to have been}} violent and tyrannical. They eventually separated, and in 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating: [...] "No one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting." ...|$|E
500|$|David {{consciously}} {{followed in}} the path of Hilda Leyel and Dorothy Hartley in researching British ingredients and dishes. [...] Like them, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> into regional history to find what she saw as [...] "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" [...] before [...] "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} {{received by the}} cast and crew for its representation of Torres' internal conflict over her half-human, half-Klingon identity. Biller identified the episode as his favorite of the three scripts he wrote for the show's first season; he also wrote [...] "Elogium" [...] and [...] "Jetrel". He viewed the scene depicting Torres' realization that she was human {{as one of the best}} from the episode. Dawson described the episode as a [...] "very big step for B'Elanna" [...] and appreciated that the script avoided a cliché ending by leaving room for Torres to deal with her internal identity struggles. Towards the end of Voyagers final season, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on the episode as one of the show's highlights. Taylor and Beltran praised Dawson for her ability to play two contrasting characters; Beltran added that it was a great episode that showcased Dawson's abilities as an actor. While Kolbe initially found Dawson's inquisitiveness and frequent questions during filming to be a challenge, he felt that she did [...] "a hell of a job on that one". He enjoyed the completed version of the episode, but expressed disappointment with its ending.|$|E

500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E
2500|$|Sage met a young Italian nobleman, Prince Ranieri di San Faustino, in Rome around 1923 [...] {{and fell}} in love with him, believing at first, as she wrote to a friend in 1924, that he was “me in another form.” They married on March 30, 1925. For ten years the couple lived the idle life of upper-class Italians, which Sage later {{described}} as “a stagnant swamp.” <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on that time as years that she simply “threw away to the crows. No reason, no purpose, nothing.” Her husband was content with their lifestyle, but Sage was not: as she wrote in her autobiography, China Eggs, “Some sort of inner sense in me was reserving my potentialities for something better and more constructive.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Watermark {{is formed}} of eleven tracks, eight of which Enya and Roma {{are listed as}} co-writers. The {{remaining}} three are instrumentals solely composed by Enya. She had performed solos as a vocal on Enya, but wanted them played by different instruments on Watermark, and employed additional musicians to play parts that were already written: Neil Buckley plays the clarinet on [...] "On Your Shore", Chris Hughes plays the rototoms on [...] "River" [...] and the rototoms and African hand drum on [...] "Storms in Africa", and Davy Spillane contributes the low whistle and Uillean pipes on [...] "Exile" [...] and [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige". Enya sings in Irish, her first language, English and Latin. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on the album in 2000: [...] "Looking back ... the words are those of loss, of reflection, of exile — not necessarily from one's country, but from those whom the heart loves. It has in its theme searching, longing, of reaching out for an answer. The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey." ...|$|E
