40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of thread mills, instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of thread mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of thread mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of thread mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of thread mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of thread mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of thread mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of thread mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the <b>spiral</b> <b>chip</b> flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions of thread mills. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} {{of magnesium}} alloy chips {{is a problem}} during high speed dry machining in industry. It should be avoided in the practical production. Many factors including machining environment, material composition, tool geometry, cutting parameters etc. can influence the cutting processes. Among these factors, cutting parameters is one of most important elements to induce the ignition of magnesium alloys. AM 50 A is a commercial magnesium alloy which is widely used in industry. However, very few reports about the ignition conditions of AM 50 A magnesium alloy are available. In this paper, we investigated the ignition conditions of AM 50 A magnesium alloy at different cutting parameters. The relationship between ignition conditions and chip morphologies was further explored. The macro morphologies of the chips were observed by optical microscope and the micro structure were obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is found that the macro morphologies of chips can be characterized into powdered chip, tubular helical chip, acicular helical chip, and long belt chip, which correspond to the different ignition conditions. The powdered <b>chips</b> and acicular <b>spiral</b> <b>chips</b> are easily ignited. They have thinner lamellar thickness {{compared to the other}} two types of chips.

40|$|This thesis investigates a novel dual {{frequency}} range low profile antenna system containing two nested spiral antennas operating over 2 – 18 GHz and 30 – 40 GHz respectively. The {{exploration and development}} of a broadband microstrip spiral without cavity backing has been implemented {{in the range of}} 2 - 18 GHz. The relationship between the structural parameters of equiangular spirals and their performance is investigated by simulating a variety of spiral structures. The input impedance, gain, axial ratio and radiation patterns of spiral antennas on a grounded dielectric substrate are compared with that of a spiral in free space to demonstrate the shortcomings of such a structure (i. e. narrow impedance bandwidth and poor gain). An effective way to achieve a broad bandwidth is proposed by introducing an impedance profile to remove the residual current along the spiral arms. Initially a Thin Film Resistive Layer (TFRL) was incorporated into a microstrip equiangular spiral antenna to absorb the residual current along the arms. Four spiral antennas with TFRLs of different thickness were developed to explore the TFRL application technique. Measured results and the difficulties in both simulation and fabrication experienced are demonstrated, analysed and addressed. An alternative to the use of a TFRL as an impedance profile on microstrip spirals, an exploration of <b>spirals</b> with embedded <b>chip</b> resistors had been conducted. The radiation physics of microstrip equiangular spirals are examined in the time domain using the XFDTD simulation package. XFDTD is used to analyse the current density distribution on the spiral arms under the excitation of pulse and harmonic waves. An analysis of the current density distribution at steady state provides guidelines for arranging the chip resistors efficiently. Chip resistor loading rules have been developed from these outcomes. A two dual arm equiangular spiral antennas with embedded chip resistors has been simulated, fabricated and measured.
