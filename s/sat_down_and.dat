5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him}} the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
60|$|Alvina <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> pale <b>and</b> trembling. Pancrazio was {{watching}} her curiously.|$|R
60|$|With these courteous words, Mr Toots <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{blushing}} <b>and</b> chuckling.|$|R
60|$|They {{answered}} {{me with a}} yell, <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> content, <b>and</b> laughed.|$|R
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|The {{participants}} were Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards. The debate, chaired by Wolf Blitzer, had an unusual format; {{for the last}} forty minutes the candidates <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the debate took a much more casual tone.|$|E
25|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1 November 1853, at his lodgings in Zürich, that he finally <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began the first {{continuous}} musical draft of the tetralogy. Five and a half years had passed since he had completed his last opera, Lohengrin.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again, <b>and</b> {{taking up}} his hand, looked through it {{carefully}} and led.|$|R
60|$|Arnold <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again, <b>and</b> waited, in {{speechless}} suspense, to {{hear what}} was coming next.|$|R
60|$|The captain <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again, <b>and</b> {{confronted him}} with a face as pale as his own.|$|R
25|$|It {{was because}} of the adult {{situations}} of this script that Reubens <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> started writing the Playhouse movie script. At first, Reubens was going to do the adult Pee-wee movie first, but within a few months, Reubens announced that it was very likely that the Playhouse movie would be made first.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Smart (December 27, 1913– March 4, 1986) was a Canadian {{poet and}} novelist. Her book, By Grand Central Station I <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept, {{detailed}} her romance with the poet George Barker. She {{is the subject}} of the 1991 biography, By Heart: Elizabeth Smart a Life, by Rosemary Sullivan, and a film, , produced by Maya Gallus of Red Queen Productions.|$|E
25|$|Anzhel Vagenshtain {{was their}} {{discoverer}} for the cinema. After reading their feuilletons in Starshel, {{he told them}} that they should write a comedy. As a joke, they <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote the screenplay for The Ancient Coin. This led to the first Bulgarian musical film, a 1965 co-production with East Germany. The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E
60|$|She {{threw her}} apron {{over her head}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> wept. He waited patiently.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Shuan {{seemed to}} understand; for he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again, <b>and</b> put {{up his hand}} to his brow.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they all}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> watched Little Joe Otter turn a somersault down the slippery slide.|$|R
25|$|Lamson and King {{settled in}} England, where she began {{work in the}} media and he worked as a {{television}} director. She worked in London as a script reader for Columbia Pictures in 1980. Soon after, she began focusing upon script writing and one of her first screenplays was a feature film adaptation of Elizabeth Smart's poem By Grand Central Station I <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept. Despite interest from various producers, the film was never made. However, the quality of the script opened doors for Lamson.|$|E
25|$|Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. For {{the pivotal}} role of Carlito's sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early {{retirement}} by {{the challenge of}} playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie The Crossing Guard and work with Pacino. De Palma and Penn <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> discussed what '70s mob lawyers looked like. Often, men {{in the entertainment business}} can look more bizarre than the talent they represent. Penn shaved the hair on the front of his forehead to give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest. Alan Dershowitz, believing that Penn was attempting to look like him, threatened the filmmakers with a defamation lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|By chance, at a {{reception}} Asad met Pola, an American of Polish origin who {{was destined to}} become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He {{fell in love with}} her and when he came to know that she had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-Pakistani national. He applied through the proper channels but the Governor-General rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote his extraordinary The Road to Mecca.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} Professor de Worms entered the place, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> carefully, <b>and</b> {{asked for a}} glass of milk.|$|R
60|$|And we doused {{the thing}} into the fixing bath <b>and</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> breathlessly <b>and</b> {{looked at each}} other.|$|R
60|$|But I didn't care. I just laughed, <b>and</b> we <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> had a long, delightful, chummy talk.|$|R
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the concert went on.|$|E
500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{started to work}} out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not answer}} him, but <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> herself, <b>and</b> he {{followed}} her example; with his eyes still upon her.|$|R
60|$|M. de Ribaumont made no answer, but <b>sat</b> wearily <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{asked for}} his little Eustacie.|$|R
60|$|I {{had risen}} when he entered. But now I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>and</b> coolly {{pointed to the}} best chair in the room.|$|R
500|$|She and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{wrote this}} song about some serious insecurities {{that we had}} {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1964, Ray Davies played {{an early version of}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] on piano to rock {{photographer}} Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, [...] "It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> plonked out, 'Der-der, der, Der-der!' He said, 'What do you reckon to this?' It meant nothing to me at the time, but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'." ...|$|E
500|$|The evening {{opened with}} Prabhupada's followers– men in [...] "Merlin gowns" [...] {{and women in}} saris– {{chanting}} Hare Krishna to an Indian tune, followed by Moby Grape. When the swami himself arrived at 10PM, the crowd of hippies rose to their feet to greet him respectfully with applause and cheers. Gurudas, one of the event's organizers, describes the effect that Prabhupada's arrival had on the audience, [...] "Then Swami Bhaktivedanta entered. He looked like a Vedic sage, exalted and otherworldly. As he advanced towards the stage, the crowd parted and made way for him, like the surfer riding a wave. He glided onto the stage, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began playing the kartals." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> now, <b>and</b> the others, {{seeing that}} {{it was best to}} let her alone for a while, chatted gaily together.|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> ate {{the cold}} food they had brought, while Rabda {{and her father}} made their breakfast of rice.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gorman turned, and, {{without the}} {{slightest}} warning, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> suddenly <b>and</b> heavily in his lap. A hum of admiration greeted the achievement.|$|R
