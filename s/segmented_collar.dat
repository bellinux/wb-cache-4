5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a <b>segmented</b> <b>collar.</b> This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E

40|$|The human Usher {{syndrome}} (USH) is {{the most}} frequent cause of combined deaf-blindness. USH is genetically heterogeneous with at least 12 chromosomal loci assigned to three clinical types, USH 1 - 3. Although these USH types exhibit similar phenotypes in human, the corresponding gene products belong to very different protein classes and families. The scaffold protein harmonin (USH 1 C) was shown to integrate all identified USH 1 and USH 2 molecules into protein networks. Here, we analyzed a protein network organized {{in the absence of}} harmonin by the scaffold proteins SANS (USH 1 G) and whirlin (USH 2 D). Immunoelectron microscopic analyses disclosed the colocalization of all network components in the apical inner <b>segment</b> <b>collar</b> and the ciliary apparatus of mammalian photoreceptor cells. In this complex, whirlin and SANS directly interact. Furthermore, SANS provides a linkage to the microtubule transport machinery, whereas whirlin may anchor USH 2 A isoform b and VLGR 1 b (very large G-protein coupled receptor 1 b) via binding to their cytodomains at specific membrane domains. The long ectodomains of both transmembrane proteins extend into the gap between the adjacent membranes of the connecting cilium and the apical inner segment. Analyses of Vlgr 1 /del 7 TM mice revealed the ectodomain of VLGR 1 b as a component of fibrous links present in this gap. Comparative analyses of mouse and Xenopus photoreceptors demonstrated that this USH protein network is also part of the periciliary ridge complex in Xenopus. Since this structural specialization in amphibian photoreceptor cells defines a specialized membrane domain for docking and fusion of transport vesicles, we suggest a prominent role of the USH proteins in cargo shipment...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the attitude of}} white collar unionized employees’ towards their union and management under three key themes – work related dimensions, union related dimensions and staff members’ loyalty towards union and management. The investigation is based on survey and informal interviews of white collar employees of Tata Centre, the corporate head-office of Tata Steel, India. The analysis suggests the existence of dual loyalty amongst those surveyed. For work related dimensions (e. g. job assignments, recruitment, salary determination, training, career) this aspiring segment believe that management has more influential role to play than the union. Management increasingly is curbing the power distance between unionized members and the officers to reinforce the loyalty of this white <b>collar</b> <b>segment.</b> However, staff members are still loyal towards the union, since union performs an important role of job security provider, which members’ value. The paper also captures changing role of union over its sixty-one years of existence and the areas of improvement, based on its members’ perception. ...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{stability}} of a collar-stiffened pipe conveying fluid was examined {{by using the}} Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The pipe considered consists of identical substructures, or cells, connected in an identical fashion. Each substructure, or cell, comprises a uniform pipe <b>segment</b> and a <b>collar.</b> A finite element model was developed to predict the {{dynamic stability}} of the stiffened pipe under {{the action of the}} flowing fluid. Stability maps were obtained for clamped-free collar-stiffened pipes of various design parameters. The design parameters included the arrangement and the geometry of the identical cells. The stability maps demonstrated that the collar-stiffened pipe exhibits unique stability characteristics when compared to a uniform pipe. It was found that the stable region in the stability map enlarges for the collar-stiffened pipe when compared to a uniform pipe. To give clearer insight into the pipe dynamic behavior, the dynamic response and eigenvalue branches were presented for a number of collar-stiffened pipes. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Recently I had the {{occasion}} to examine a collection of 230 unidentified specimens of the family Miridae kindly loaned to me for examination by the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, Netherlands. All these were collected in Cyprus. Three specimens belong to the genus Alloeotomus Fieber and represent a new species which is described here. Until now the southernmost limits {{of the distribution of}} Alloeotomus were Sicily (Wagner, 1954) in the west and Peking (China) (Reuter, 1903) in the east. The discovery of the new species from Cyprus has extended this limit further to the south. There are now five species in the genus Alloeotomus including the new one. A key to facilitate their identification is given in this paper. Alloeotomus Fieber Alloeotomus Fieber, 1858, Wien. ent. Monatschr., 2 : 303.

We herein examined &alpha;V&szlig; 3 integrin expression as a function of carotid atherosclerosis formation in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE&ndash;/&ndash;) mouse. Methods and results: Constrictive collars were placed around the left common carotid arteries of apo E&ndash;/&ndash; mice maintained on a high-fat diet (n = 14). Before and 21 days following collar placement, in vivo serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of the carotid aortic diameter were performed using a 7 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was performed (n = 6) using an in vivo imaging system 0 &ndash; 24 hours following administration of 1. 0 nmol c(RGDyK) -Cy 5. 5 via the tail vein. A competition experiment was performed by the co-injection of a saturating dose of bicyclic RGD peptide H-Glu[cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Lys) ] 2 (n = 3). Following image acquisition and sacrifice at 24 hours after injection, carotid arteries were harvested for histological analyses. Neointima formation and arterial remodeling in the carotid arteries of apoE&ndash;/&ndash; mice were induced by the placement of a constrictive collar. Significantly greater fluorescent signals were obtained from constrictive collar left common carotid arteries as compared to uninvolved aortic <b>segments</b> in constrictive <b>collar</b> mice. Binding to stenotic lesions was efficiently blocked in competition experiments. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of mural &alpha;V&szlig; 3 integrin expression in macrophages in the neointima. Signal intensity increased in a macrophage density-dependent fashion in the stenotic segments. Conclusion: Mural &alpha;V&szlig; 3 integrin expression, as determined using RGD-Cy 5. 5 near-infrared optical imaging, was increased in carotid arteries with constrictive collars in experimental mice. This expression can estimate the macrophage-bound inflammatory activity of atherosclerotic lesions.
