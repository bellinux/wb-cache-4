As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex <b>spline</b> <b>teeth</b> which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} methods {{available}} for developing profiles of gear and <b>spline</b> <b>teeth.</b> Most {{of the techniques}} are inaccurate because they use only an approximation of the involute curve profile. The parametric method developed in this paper provides accurate involute curve creation using formulas and exact geometric equations. In addition, the involute curve by equation technique allows using either Cartesian in terms of X, Y, and Z or cylindrical coordinate systems to create the involute curve profile. Since spur gear geometry is controlled by a few basic parameters, a generic gear can be designed by three common parameters namely the pressure angle (a), the module (m), {{and the number of}} teeth (z). Most of the present day CAD systems have no built-in tool for designing such gears. This paper is an attempt in utilizing the concept of parametric technology to develop a template gear.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a failure {{analysis of a}} reverse shaft in the transmission system of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). The reverse shaft with splines fractured into two pieces during operation. Visual examination of the fractured surface clearly showed cracks initiated from the roots of <b>spline</b> <b>teeth.</b> To find out the cause of fracture of the shaft, a finite element analysis was carried out to pre-dict the stress state of the shaft under steady loading and shock loading, respectively. The steady loading was pro-duced under normal operation, while the shock loading could be generated by an abrupt change of operation such as start-up or sudden braking during working. Results of stress analysis reveal that the highest stressed area coin-cided with the fractured regions of the failed shaft. The maximum stress predicted under shock loading exceeded the yield strength and {{was believed to be}} the stimulant for crack initiation and propagation at this weak region. The failure analysis thus showed that the premature fatigue fracture of the shaft was caused by abnormal operation. Finally, some suggestions to enhance service durability of the transmission system of ATV are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Spline {{couplings}} {{are often}} over dimensioned concerning fatigue life, {{but they are}} subjected to wear phenomena. For as concerns fatigue life, standard design methods consider {{only a part of}} the <b>spline</b> <b>teeth</b> to be in contact and this brings to underestimate the components life, so a better understanding about component fatigue behavior may allow to a weight reduction and a consequent increasing of machine efficiency. On the other hand, wear damage may cause spline coupling run outs; this phenomenon is generally caused by the relative sliding between engaging teeth; the sliding may be due to kinematic conditions (angular misalignment between shafts) of teeth deflection. In order to obtain component optimization, both fatigue and wear behavior have to be taken into account. Standard spline coupling design methods do not properly consider wear damage and they evaluate fatigue life with big approximations. In this work fatigue damage are experimentally and numerically investigated while wear damage has been experimentally evaluated. Experimental results have been obtained by a dedicated test rig. Fatigue tests have been performed by means of a special device connected to a standard fatigue machine. Tests have been done by varying the most important working parameters (torque and misalignment angle). Experimental results have been compared with standard design methods to evaluate if and how they may over dimension the components. Results show that concerning the fatigue life, the actual component life is higher respect to that calculated by standard methods. Regarding wear behavior, results shows that whenever a relative motion between engaging teeth is present, wear damage appears...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} industrial applicatzon of harmonic drives, {{the source}} of some elastokinetic phenomena {{and their impact on}} overall system behavior has not been fully addressed thus far. Some of these phenomena severely influence the behavior of robot arms, both in free and constrained motions, when the end effector is in contact with an environment. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} derive an effective, control-oriented model of a harmonic-drive-based robot joint. Systematic observations of an experimental robot with harmonic drives has revealed that the harmonic drive could not entirely transmit the input torque to the output shaft, due to a nonlinear meshing process between the flexible and circular <b>spline</b> <b>teeth.</b> The torque transmitted to the output shaft might saturate at a much lower value than expected (e. g., motor torque multiplied by the gear ratio). This phenomenon may severely influence the system behavior, par-ticularly in force/impedance control tasks when full joint-torque capacity and wide bandwidth are needed. To understand the harmonic-drive behavior, as well as to derive a convenient form of its model, we have shown restrained motion experi-ments to be much more useful than free-motion experiments. In this article, we also introduce mathematical models and describe experiments related to other physical phenomena, such as nonlinear stiffness, hysteresis, and soft windup. The goal of our modeling strategy was not to develop a precise and possi-bly complicated model, but to generate an appropriate model that could be easily used by control engineers to improve joint behavior To visualize the developed model, equivalent mechan-ical and electrical schemes of the joint are introduced. Finally, a simple and reliable estimation procedure has been established for obtaining joint parameters, to ascertain the integrity of the proposed model. 1...|$|E
40|$|Spline {{couplings}} are {{a compact}} and efficient means for transferring torque between shafts in gas turbine aeroengines. With {{competition in the}} aerospace market {{and the need to}} reduce fuel burn from the flight carriers, there is an ever-present requirement for enhanced performance. Spline couplings are complex components that can fail from a variety of mechanisms, and are susceptible to fretting wear and fretting fatigue (FF). Due to the expensive nature of full-scale testing, this thesis investigates the use of the representative specimen (RS) concept for predicting fretting-induced damage between <b>spline</b> <b>teeth.</b> A combined experimental and computational RS methodology is developed, using a uniaxial representative specimen (URS) and a multiaxial representative specimen (MRS). The URS test rig simulates spline torque and axial loads from the overall flight cycle and associated damage. The MRS simulates the combination of the same major loads, with the addition of high-cycle bending loads from in-flight fluctuations. The URS was successfully employed for experimental characterisation of a range of spline material combinations, including inference of the coefficient-of-friction. The MRS successfully characterised the multiaxial FF behaviour of the current material of choice for triple-spool gas turbine couplings. A finite element-based total fatigue life (crack nucleation and propagation) capability was successfully validated for the MRS and URS. A global sub-modelling technique was employed, whereby a critical-plane Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) fatigue parameter predicted crack nucleation, an El Haddad approach predicted short crack growth and a weighted function approach predicted long crack growth. A novel FF damage parameter, Dfret, was also implemented to incorporate the combined effects of relative slip and surface shear traction, in conjunction with the SWT parameter, for life prediction. The required material constants were obtained and captured the measured effect of relative slip on a titanium alloy and the measured effect of contact size on an aluminium alloy.

40|$|The thesis {{refers to}} "Fatigue Assessment of Components inConstruction Equipment". The subject {{was chosen because}} ofincreasing {{interest}} in higher payloads, lower weight, highervelocities and shorter load cycles in construction equipmentvehicles. The main research goal in this thesis is to investigatetechniques to extend the fatigue life of an induction hardeneddrive shaft, with splines. Areas related to this research areresidual stress, fatigue life assessments, manufacturingprocess parameters and hardening process parameters. Themethods used to achieve the goal are process simulations,fatigue tests, finite element calculations, measurements ofresidual stress and fatigue life assessments. The aim of thepresent research is to cover several aspects of applied fatigueassessment. Most of the theoretical work has been verified withmeasurements and fatigue tests. The residual stresses have been calculated by simulating thehardening process with SYSWELD, a Finite Element program. Thesimulated residual stress beneath the surface was compared toX-ray and neutron diffraction measurements. The conformancewith simulations and X-ray measurements was relatively good,but the conformance with neutron diffraction measurements wasnot so good. The detrimental axial tensile residual stress atthe core {{was found to be}} in the order of 800 - 900 MPa, for theshafts. About 100 shafts have been fatigue tested in torsion, bothin constant amplitude and in variable amplitude and some of theresults have been reported in this thesis. For many of theshafts, crack initiation beneath the hardening layer wasdetected, which depends on the high tensile residual stress inthe core. Fatigue life assessments were made on the shafts,using a multiaxial strain based critical plane model, with themeasured residual stresses as input data. The generalconclusion is that the induction hardening process parametersinfluence the residual stresses to a high extent and thusinfluence fatigue life. Simulations of how different hardeningprocess parameters influence the residual stress profile havebeen done. Low hardening power and low frequency seem to reducethe detrimental tensile residual stress at the core. The load distribution along the axis of the <b>spline</b> <b>teeth</b> hasbeen investigated. The shear stress concentration in a splinehas been calculated by the finite element method, using anon-linear model, and was compared with results found in theliterature. An equation describing how the tooth thicknessshould vary to obtain smooth contact in the axial direction hasbeen derived. Finally, fatigue tests have been made oninduction hardened shafts in torsion with crack initiation atthe spline surface. The influence of pitch errors on fatigue life for splineshas also been estimated, by using a weakest link failureprobability model and combining it with a 2 -parameter Weibullfailure distribution model. The conclusion is that pitch errorsin the investigated splines appear to reduce fatigue life byabout 50 - 70 %, compared with ideal pitch. NR 2014080...|$|E

To improve the surface property of a spline, an involute spline is selected as the object of this study.

50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the circular <b>spline,</b> meshing the <b>teeth</b> of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 â 202)/200 = â0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|R
