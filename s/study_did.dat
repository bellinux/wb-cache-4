5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The <b>study</b> <b>did</b> not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 <b>study</b> <b>did</b> not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E
5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin <b>study</b> <b>did</b> not confirm this.|$|E
30|$|In {{the same}} time, higher {{headache}} prevalence was reported from other <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in Brazil (74.5 %) [6] and in Iran (90.5 % in males and 88.8 % in females) [8]. According to <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in KSA, higher headache prevalence (92 %) was reported from a <b>study</b> <b>done</b> on female university students at Taibah University (2015) [19].|$|R

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological <b>study,</b> <b>did</b> not place {{it close to}} any other member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). The {{study found that the}} sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 <b>study</b> <b>did</b> not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the <b>study</b> <b>did</b> not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E
30|$|For {{migraine}} prevalence, {{a higher}} prevalence {{was reported in}} previous Saudi <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students of King Faisal University (58.4 %) [7] and Taibah University (61.8 %) [19]. The lower prevalence found in our study (32.5 %) {{could be explained by}} the fact that we only describe a 3 -month prevalence. In the same time, lower migraine prevalence was reported from other <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in other Arab and foreign countries [10, 21], and in a <b>study</b> <b>done</b> in KSA [17].|$|R
