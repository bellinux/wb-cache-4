60|$|Mr. Wharton was and {{had for a}} {{great many}} years been a {{barrister}} practising in the Equity Courts,--or rather in one Equity Court, for throughout a life's work now extending to nearly fifty years, he had hardly ever gone out of the single Vice-Chancellor's Court which was much better known by Mr. Wharton's name than by that of the less eminent judge who now sat there. His had been a very peculiar, a very toilsome, but yet probably a very <b>satisfactory</b> <b>life.</b> He had begun his practice early, and had worked in a stuff gown till he was nearly sixty. At that time he had amassed a large fortune, mainly from his profession, but partly also by the careful use of his own small patrimony and by his wife's money. Men {{knew that he was}} rich, but no one knew the extent of his wealth. When he submitted to take a silk gown, he declared among his friends that he did so as a step preparatory to his retirement. The altered method of work would not suit him at his age, nor,--as he said,--would it be profitable. He would take his silk as an honour for his declining years, so that he might become a bencher at his Inn. But he had now been working for the last twelve or fourteen years with his silk gown,--almost as hard as in younger days, and with pecuniary results almost as serviceable; and though from month to month he declared his intention of taking no fresh briefs, and though he did now occasionally refuse work, still he was there with his mind as clear as ever, and with his body apparently as little affected by fatigue.|$|E
60|$|It is not {{irrelevant}} to Clemens {{to say that}} Grant seemed to like finding himself in company with two literary men, one of whom at least he could make sure of, and unlike that silent man he was reputed, he talked constantly, and so far as he might he talked literature. At least he talked of John Phoenix, that delightfulest of the early Pacific Slope humorists, whom he had known under his real name of George H. Derby, when they were fellow-cadets at West Point. It was mighty pretty, as Pepys would say, to see the delicate deference Clemens paid our plain hero, and the manly respect with which he listened. While Grant talked, his luncheon was brought in from some unassuming restaurant near by, and he asked us {{to join him in}} the baked beans and coffee which were served us in a little room out of the office with about the same circumstance as at a railroad refreshment-counter. The baked beans and coffee were of about the railroad-refreshment quality; but eating them with Grant was like sitting down to baked beans and coffee with Julius Caesar, or Alexander, or some other great Plutarchan captain. One of the highest satisfactions of Clemens's often supremely <b>satisfactory</b> <b>life</b> was his relation to Grant. It was his proud joy to tell how he found Grant about to sign a contract for his book on certainly very good terms, and said to him that he would himself publish the book and give him a percentage three times as large. He said Grant seemed to doubt whether he could honorably withdraw from the negotiation at that point, but Clemens overbore his scruples, and it was his unparalleled privilege, his princely pleasure, to pay the author a far larger check for his work than had ever been paid to an author before. He valued even more than this splendid opportunity the sacred moments in which their business brought him into the presence of the slowly dying, heroically living man whom he was so befriending; and he told me in words which surely lost none of their simple pathos through his report how Grant described his suffering.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) {{is usually a}} sudden {{traumatic}} event and has {{a negative effect on}} sexual function. Aim: To evaluate the characteristics of sexual activity in men with SCI and identify predictors of being sexually active and having a <b>satisfactory</b> sex <b>life.</b> Methods: We assessed sexual activity profiles of men with SCI from a Brazilian tertiary rehabilitation center from February to August 2012. All patients older than 18 years with SCI for longer than 1 year were invited to participate. We analyzed age, time since SCI, patient age at SCI, employment status, partner status, completeness of lesion, functional independence, urinary continence, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score. Main Outcome Measures: The SHIM was used to assess erectile function (EF). Satisfaction with sex life was analyzed as a dichotomous variable. Predictors of an active and <b>satisfactory</b> sex <b>life</b> were identified using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: We evaluated 295 men with mean age of 40. 7 ± 14. 5 years. Most patients had a complete SCI (65. 1 %) and 159 (53. 9 %) were incontinent. The median SHIM score was 5 (interquartile range = 0 – 16) and only 71 men (24. 1 %) had a SHIM score of at least 17. Of these men, 159 (53. 9 %) were sexually active. Only 63 men (39. 6 %) were satisfied with their sex life after SCI. In univariable analysis, all variables were associated with an active sex life. Those with a SHIM score of at least 17 had a greater likelihood of being sexually active (odds ratio = 116, 95 % confidence interval = 14 – 432). EF was the only parameter associated with a <b>satisfactory</b> sex <b>life</b> (odds ratio = 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 2 – 1. 4). Conclusions: Most men with SCI were sexually inactive and/or dissatisfied with their sex life. Age, duration of SCI, completeness of SCI, continence, having a partner, and good EF were identified as predictors of an active sex life. However, only EF was a predictor of a <b>satisfactory</b> sex <b>life.</b> Gomes CM, Miranda EP, de Bessa J, et al. Erectile Function Predicts Sexual Satisfaction in Men With Spinal Cord Injury.

50|$|Italian war novels, such as Alba de Céspedes's Dalla parte di lei (The Best of Husbands, 1949), trace women's awakenings to {{political}} {{realities of the}} time.

50|$|Harris wrote principally on the French {{philosophers}} Comte and Henri Bergson and the Latin-American philosopher Francisco Romero. A {{major theme}} of her writing {{is the role}} of philosophy in illuminating what is significant in an individual life, and here she shows the influence of Bergson's conception of 'life' as well as John Dewey's pragmatism. The title of one of her books, Sub Specie Aeternitatis (1937, 'from the perspective of eternity'), makes visible her concern to connect what is (or may be) universally true with the individual experiences that fall within our often narrow perceptions. She is much concerned with how the human quest for truth and meaning in a life are shaped by our notions of experience, transcendence (as developed by Romero), freedom, and will. One of her lines of argument holds that a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>life</b> requires a certain degree of detachment as well as the ability to resist trying to organize all experience through rigid and predetermined categories.|$|E

The focus of positive psychology is on personal growth rather than on pathology.It has been argued that this binary, dichotomous view has fuelled both positive psychology's success and decline. The single-minded focus on positivity has resulted in persistent backlash (e.g., Frawley, 2015 for a recent review). The following criticisms have been leveled against positive psychology by researchers both outside of and within the positive psychology community. These include the [...] "tyranny" [...] of positivity and the lack of balance between positives and negatives; failing to cover the entire spectrum of human experiences; failing to recognize the importance of contextual variables; and assuming that the Western individualistic culture represents the universal human experience.

Singer comments on the effect of having the widest perspective possible on our ethical decisions; on how our rational capability sometimes leads us to change our goal; and on the paradoxical opportunity that the existence of so many ills on the world brings to us by way of showing plenty of clearly worthwhile goals. To live a good life, the book prescribes: [...] "You can rethink your goals and question what you are doing with your life. That might mean quitting your job, selling your house, and going to work for a voluntary organization in India.
