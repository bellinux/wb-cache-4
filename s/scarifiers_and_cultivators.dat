It is found to succeed better when only the surface of the soil is stirred by the <b>scarifier</b> <b>and</b> harrow than when a plowing is given. It grows rapidly in spring, and yields an abundant crop of green food, particularly palatable to livestock. It is also suitable for making into hay.

But to Jethro Tull is indisputably due the honour of having first demonstrated the importance of frequent hoeing, not merely to extirpate weeds, but for the purpose of pulverising the soil, by which process the gases and moisture of the atmosphere are enabled more freely to penetrate to the roots of the crop.|$|R

40|$|Herbal {{medicines}} are {{in great}} demand for preliminary health care {{due to their}} wide medicinal value, with no side effects. Since many species {{are used in the}} system of traditional medicine, scientists have great opportunities to develop appropriate packages of practices for their multiplication and conservation. Abrus precatorius is the native plant of India and used in many ways in the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine. This seeds of the species is dormant due to hard seed coat. So the aim of the study is to remove seed dormancy and enhance germination capacity within a short period. To overcome the problem of dormancy, seeds were scarified by seed <b>scarifier</b> <b>and</b> sand paper and also treated with acid (H 2 SO 4) and hot water just before sowing. 60 - 95 % germination was achieved under different treatment conditions while the seeds without any treatment fail to germinate. The highest (95 %) germination was observed just 12 days after sowing in seeds treated with concentrated H 2 SO 4 for 120 minutes. 70 - 75 % germination was achieved when the seeds were treated with acid for 105 and 135 minutes. Seeds treated with con. H 2 SO 4 for 150, 90 and 60 minutes and also scarified by sand paper showed similar results with 60 - 65 % germination. The seeds scarified by a mechanical <b>scarifier</b> <b>and</b> treated with hot water did not show more than 32. 5 % germination...|$|R

5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone <b>scarifier</b> <b>and</b> barrel ring <b>scarifier,</b> <b>and</b> development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.|$|R
