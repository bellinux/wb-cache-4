50|$|Although {{cognitive}} radio was initially {{thought of as}} a software-defined radio extension (full {{cognitive radio}}), most research work focuses on spectrum-sensing cognitive radio (particularly in the TV bands). The chief problem in spectrum-sensing cognitive radio is designing high-quality spectrum-sensing devices and algorithms for exchanging spectrum-sensing data between nodes. It has been shown that a simple energy detector cannot guarantee the accurate detection of signal presence, calling for more sophisticated <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> techniques and requiring information about <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> to be regularly exchanged between nodes. Increasing the number of cooperating sensing nodes decreases the probability of false detection.|$|E

30|$|Spectrum {{access is}} very {{important}} for SUs in CRNs, since the communication of PUs in CRNs must be protected at first [11]. Some early research works focused on the spectrum access in the uplink [12] and downlink [13] of PUs, where both the control and the scheduling were managed by the base stations (BSs) in CRNs. Based on these works, a cooperative <b>spectrum</b> <b>sense</b> of other SUs was introduced to reduce the false detection caused by shadowing fading [14]. Furthermore, it was proposed that both PUs and SUs can operate spectrum access in CRNs to improve the transmission rate, where the network connectivity and flexibility can be also enhanced [15].|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{proposed}} CSIT predictor is compared with nonpredictive CR in LTE-A {{in terms of}} five performance measures, i.e., <b>spectrum</b> utilization, <b>sensing</b> energy, channel switching rate, packet loss ratio (PLR), and average instantaneous throughput.

50|$|In radiocommunications, lower THD means {{pure signal}} {{emission}} without causing interferences to otherelectronic devices.

50|$|The first {{cognitive}} radio wireless regional area network standard, IEEE 802.22, {{was developed by}} IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standard Committee (LMSC) and published in 2011. This standard uses geolocation and <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> for spectral awareness. Geolocation combines with a database of licensed transmitters {{in the area to}} identify available channels for use by the {{cognitive radio}} network. <b>Spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> observes the spectrum and identifies occupied channels. IEEE 802.22 was designed to utilize the unused frequencies or fragments of time in a location. This white space is unused television channels in the geolocated areas. However, cognitive radio cannot occupy the same unused space all the time. As spectrum availability changes, the network adapts to prevent interference with licensed transmissions.|$|E
40|$|The {{cognitive}} radio {{is one of}} the novel concepts from conventional exclusive spectrum assignment to dynamic spectrum assign. The cognitive Radio built on a software defined radio, is defined as an unpredictable growth of wireless communication scheme, it is automatic adjustment of the electromagnetic environment to adapt their operation and dynamically its radio operating parameters while bring no harmful interference to the PU. This paper proposes energy detection (ED) for <b>spectrums</b> <b>sensing</b> on the basis of estimated SNR, which is calculated in advance for available channels. In the proposed method which is also analysis performance of the SNR and the Decision Accuracy using different FFT and wavelet family of the Haar, and Dabuchesis wavelet in terms of different value of the SNR, Probability of Detection...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the model}} {{proposed}} in [9], the cognitive cycle consists of four functions for <b>spectrum</b> management: <b>sensing,</b> decision, sharing, and mobility. Only the first two functions (sensing and decision) {{are directly related to}} the problem of assigning channels; therefore, the other functions (sharing and mobility) will not be considered in this study.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMammals detect {{temperature}} with specialized neurons in {{the peripheral}} nervous system. Four TRPV-class channels have {{been implicated in}} sensing heat, and one TRPM-class channel in sensing cold. The combined range of temperatures that activate these channels covers {{a majority of the}} relevant physiological <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensed</b> by most mammals, with a significant gap in the noxious cold range. Here, we describe the characterization of ANKTM 1, a cold-activated channel with a lower activation temperature compared to the cold and menthol receptor, TRPM 8. ANKTM 1 is a distant family member of TRP channels with very little amino acid similarity to TRPM 8. It is found in a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it is coexpressed with TRPV 1 /VR 1 (the capsaicin/heat receptor) but not TRPM 8. Consistent with the expression of ANKTM 1, we identify noxious cold-sensitive sensory neurons that also respond to capsaicin but not to menthol...|$|R
5000|$|Wideband {{spectrum}} sensing: {{refers to}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> over large spectral bandwidth, typically hundreds of MHz or even several GHz. Since current ADC technology cannot afford the high sampling rate with high resolution, it requires revolutional techniques, e.g., compressive sensing and sub-Nyquist sampling.|$|E
50|$|In <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> {{cognitive}} radio, OFDMA is {{a possible}} approach to filling free radio frequency bands adaptively. Timo A. Weiss and Friedrich K. Jondral of the University of Karlsruhe proposed a spectrum pooling system in which free bands sensed by nodes were immediately filled by OFDMA subbands.|$|E
50|$|The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), {{together}} with the FCC, pursued a centralized approach for available spectrum discovery. Specifically each base station (BS) would be armed with a GPS receiver which would allow its position to be reported. This information would {{be sent back to}} centralized servers (in the USA these would be managed by the FCC), which would respond with the information about available free TV channels and guard bands {{in the area of the}} BS. Other proposals would allow local <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> only, where the BS would decide by itself which channels are available for communication. A combination of these two approaches is also envisioned. Devices which would operate in the TV white space band (TVWS) would be mainly of two types: Fixed and Personal/Portable. Fixed devices would have geolocation capability with an embedded GPS device. Fixed devices also communicate with the central database to identify other transmitters in the area operating in TVWS. Other measures suggested by the FCC and IEEE to avoid interference include dynamic <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> and dynamic power control.|$|E

40|$|In LEO mobile {{satellite}} network, the L/S frequency availability is {{an essential}} task for global communication but entails several major technical challenges: high sampling rate required for wideband sensing, limited power and computing resources for processing load, and frequency-selective wireless fading. This paper investigates the issue of frequency availability in LEO mobile satellite system, and a novel wideband spectrum compressed signal detection approach is proposed to obtain active primary users (PUs) subbands and their locations that should be avoided during frequency allocation. We define the novel wideband <b>spectrum</b> compressed <b>sensing</b> method based on discrete sine transform (DST-WSCS), which significantly improves the performance of spectrum detection and recovery accuracy compared with conventional discrete Fourier transform based wideband <b>spectrum</b> compressed <b>sensing</b> scheme (DFT-WSCS). Additionally, {{with the help of}} intersatellite links (ISL), the scheme of multiple satellites cooperative sensing according to OR and MAJ decision fusion rules is presented to achieve spatial diversity against wireless fading. Finally, in-depth numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in aspect of signal detection probability, reconstruction precision, processing time, and so forth...|$|R
5000|$|Cyclostationary-feature detection: These type of <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> {{algorithms}} {{are motivated}} because most man-made communication signals, such as BPSK, QPSK, AM, OFDM, etc. exhibit cyclostationary behavior. However, noise signals (typically white noise) do not exhibit cyclostationary behavior. These detectors are robust against noise variance uncertainty. The aim of such detectors is {{to exploit the}} cyclostationary nature of man-made communication signals buried in noise. Cyclostationary detectors can be either single cycle or multicycle cyclostatonary.|$|E
50|$|TV White Space database, also {{commonly}} referred to as geolocation database, is an entity that controls the TV spectrum utilization by unlicensed white spaces devices within a determined geographical area. Its sole objective is to enable unlicensed access to white space spectrum while protecting incumbent broadcasting services. TV White Space database was first brought as a way to overcome the technical hurdles faced by <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> techniques to precisely detect very weak primary signals.|$|E
50|$|To perform {{reliable}} sensing, in {{the basic}} operation mode on a single frequency band as described above (the “listen-before-talk” mode) one has to allocate quiet times, in which no data transmission is permitted. Such periodic interruption of data transmission could impair the QoS of cognitive radio systems. This issue is addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in IEEE 802.22 called Dynamic frequency hopping (DFH) where data transmission of the WRAN systems are performed in parallel with <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> without any interruption.|$|E

The IEEE 802.22 standard not only specifies the PHY and MAC protocols, but also includes many cognitive functions, such as <b>spectrum</b> management, <b>sensing</b> interface, geo-location and database access, etc. This standard aims to provide broadband wireless access in the TVWS and the data transmission {{is designed to be}} 1.5 Mb/s for the downlink and 384 kb/s for the uplink.|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal field (LF = 110 G) muon spin {{relaxation}} (mu SR) {{has been}} used to investigate the pressure dependence (P < 4. 5 kbar) of paramagnetic spin fluctuations in the spin glass alloy Y(Mn 0. 95 Al 0. 05) (2) via observation of the mu(+) spin depolarization. External mechanical force is seen to counteract the Al-induced chemical pressure, fully delocalizing the Mn moment and altering the nature of the spin fluctuation <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensed</b> by the muon. A qualitative change in the functional form of the mu(+) spin depolarization is observed. Complementary ambient and high-pressure neutron diffraction measurements suggest not only pressure-dependent structural transitions but also the instability of the localized manganese moment. The ambient and high-pressure mu(+) spin depolarization results from Y(Mn 0. 95 Al 0. 05) (2) are likened to P = 0 results reported for other Y(Mn 1 -xAlx) (2) alloys. Finally, the possibility of using mu(+) spin depolarization rates to predict experimental inelastic neutron scattering (INS) line widths is considered; the muon having the potential to provide information equivalent to that obtained via INS but with greatly reduced data collection times...|$|R

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} of the cognitive radio based wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRAN), is to address two apparently conflicting requirements: assuring Quality of Services (QoS) satisfaction for services provided by the cognitive radio networks, while providing reliable <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> for guaranteeing licensed user protection. To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band (the so-called “listenbefore-talk” mode) one has to allocate Quiet Times, in which no data transmission is permitted. Such periodic interruption of data transmission could impair the QoS of cognitive radio systems.|$|E
5000|$|Energy {{detection}}: Energy detection is a <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> {{method that}} detects the presence/absence of a signal just {{by measuring the}} received signal power. This signal detection approach is quite easy and convenient for practical implementation. To implement energy detector, however, noise variance information is required. It {{has been shown that}} an imperfect knowledge of the noise power (noise uncertainty) may lead to the phenomenon of the SNR wall, which is a SNR level below which the energy detector can not reliably detect any transmitted signal even increasing the observation time. It has also been shown that the SNR wall is not caused by the presence of a noise uncertainty itself, but by an insufficient refinement of the noise power estimation while the observation time increases.|$|E
5000|$|As {{leader of}} Microsoft's Networking over White Spaces (KNOWS) project, Dr. Bahl led a {{worldwide}} effort to harness relatively unused spectra (TV white space) using a fundamentally different approach (opportunistic sharing of spectrum) from previous allocations. In 2007 {{he and his}} group built the first TV white space radio, tested by the Federal Communications Commission; in 2009, they carried {{out some of the}} first US tests of whitespace radio communications; on April 7, 2010, as part of the IEEE DySPAN conference keynote talk, he announced the free availability of a white space spectrum database for research. [...] On August 14, 2010, Dr. Bahl and Microsoft’s Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie hosted U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski and FCC managing director Steven Van Roekei on Microsoft’s Redmond campus. During this meeting, Dr. Bahl presented the details of the white space networking technology and his group demonstrated the world’s first campus-wide TV white space network. [...] One month later, on September 23, 2010, the FCC made a historic ruling which opened up over 180 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed use in the United States and another subsequent ruling that made <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensing</b> a non-mandatory requirement, a decision that {{is expected to be the}} key reason for the success of this technology. Following the FCC’s lead, spectrum regulatory bodies of several other countries passed similar rulings. Dr. Bahl’s efforts were covered extensively by the mainstream media. [...] He and his group published several seminal papers including a best paper in SIGCOMM 2009 titled “White Space Networking with Wi-Fi like Connectivity”. These publications triggered a wave of further research in dynamic spectrum access. Since then Dr. Bahl has continued to pursue this line of research, incorporating newer technologies such as smart antennas, MIMO, and software defined radios into wide area unlicensed networks.|$|E

40|$|Assessing the {{distribution}} and extent of salt-affected soils in expansive, arid, rangeland areas is diffi cult. Such a landscape may be well suited for analysis with satellite-derived remotely sensed data because of low vegetation cover, thus {{the majority of its}} spectral response would be generated by soil and rock surface characteristics. Spectral characteristics of different land surfaces associated with distinct soil types and their mineral assemblages (e. g., Baumgardner et al., 1985; Ben-Dor, 2002; Brown et al., 2006) may provide a means of quickly and remotely identifying and delineating salt-affected soils. Satellite-derived remote sensing uses space-borne sensor plat-forms to quantify the refl ectance or emissions of electromagnetic radiation from the Earth (Lillesand and Kiefer, 2000). These refl ec-tance and emission data can be analyzed to extract information about the Earth and its resources, and how the properties of differ-ent objects and surfaces vary across the electromagnetic spectrum. Satellite imagery can have a variety of spectral and spatial properties. Spectral resolution refers to the number of spectral bands used by a particular sensor and the width of the electromagnetic <b>spectrum</b> <b>sensed</b> in each band, whereas spatial resolution refers to the area on the ground represented by an individual pixel. Spectral bands with contrasting refl ectance characteristics for a minimum area on a given surface can be compared to enhance those specifi c characteristics and differentiate features on the Earth’s surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this report, stereospecific {{structural}} and dynamic features in DNA are studied using the site-directed spin labeling technique. A stable nitroxide radical, 1 -oxyl- 4 -bromo- 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethylpyrroline (R 5 a), was attached postsynthetically to phosphorothioates that were chemically introduced, {{one at a}} time, at five sites of a DNA duplex. The two phosphorothioate diastereomers (Rp or Sp) were separated, and nitroxide rotational motions were monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra vary according to diastereomer identity and location of the labeling site, with Rp-R 5 a spectra effectively reporting on local DNA structural features and Sp-R 5 a <b>spectra</b> <b>sensing</b> variations in local DNA motions. This establishes Rp- and Sp-R 5 a as unique probes for investigating nucleic acids in a site- and stereospecific manner, which may aid studies of stereospecific DNA/protein interactions. In addition, weighted averages of individual Rp and Sp spectra match those of R 5 a attached to mixed diastereomers. This suggests that R 5 a linked to mixed diastereomers reports on the composite behaviors of Rp- and Sp-R 5 a and is useful in initial probing of the DNA local environment. This work advances understanding of R 5 a/DNA coupling, and is a key step forward in developing a nucleotide-independent spectroscopic probe for studying nucleic acids...|$|R

30|$|The shortwave {{infrared}} radiation {{is the best}} spectral region of the electromagnetic <b>spectrum</b> for <b>sensing</b> various aspects of hydrothermal alteration zones. Hydroxyl-bearing minerals including clay and sulfate {{groups as well as}} carbonate minerals present diagnostic spectral absorption features due to vibrational processes of fundamental absorptions of Al–O–H, Mg–O–H, Si–O–H, and CO 3 groups in the shortwave {{infrared radiation}} region, and thus this wavelength region is the best to explore and map hydrothermal alteration zones. The most important characteristics of the SWIR wavelength region are to identify and map the spatial distribution of hydrothermal alteration minerals containing OH groups (Huntington 1996).|$|R
40|$|Opportunistic {{spectrum}} access (OSA) {{that allows}} secondary users to independently search for and exploit instantaneous spectrum availability is considered. The design {{objective is to}} maximize the throughput of a secondary user while limiting the probability of colliding with primary users. Integrated in the joint design are three basic components: a spectrum sensor that identifies <b>spectrum</b> opportunities, a <b>sensing</b> strategy that determines which channels in the <b>spectrum</b> to <b>sense,</b> and an access strategy that decides whether to access based on potentially erroneous sensing outcomes. This joint design is formulated as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and a separation principle is established. The separation principle reveals the optimality of myopic policies {{for the design of}} the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore, it decouples the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, and reduces the constrained POMDP to an unconstrained one. Numerical examples are provided to study the tradeoff between sensing time and transmission time, the interaction between the physical layer spectrum sensor and the MAC layer sensing and access strategies, and the robustness of the ensuing design to model mismatch...|$|R
