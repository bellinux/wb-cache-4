Design: A cross-sectional, descriptive study design was used and data were collected using two Internet-based questionnaires. Participants: The <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>calculated</b> for the study was 284 using 95 % confidence levels and a 5 % margin of error. There were 395 participants that {{were included in the}} study. Outcome measures: The variables measured included demographic, employment, educational and occupational factors. Results: The lifetime prevalence of WRTP in the physiotherapists was 65. 3 %. The manual techniques that were significantly associated with WRTP in the respondents who reported thumb problems were all grades of transverse glides applied to the spine as well as grade II–IV unilateral and central posterior-anterior pressures to the spine. The factors that remained significantly associated with WRTP in all 395 respondents after regression analysis were the cervical treatment of up to six patients a day and hyperextension > 30 ° of the non-dominant interphalangeal (IP) joint of the thumb. Conclusion: This study confirms that a high percentage of physiotherapists using manual therapy techniques to treat musculoskeletal conditions are experiencing WRTP. Recommendations: The development of a valid and reliable WRTP screening tool is needed to aid in the identification of physiotherapists at risk and thus in the primary prevention of WRTP. A longitudinal study which follows newly qualified physiotherapists is recommended to investigate a possible cause-effect relationship and preventative strategies for WRTP in physiotherapists. </p...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to determine the sample size (the number of sampling points) needed to estimate the average population density of the bugs, and to verify the variability in sample size for the phases and species of the bugs and the phenological stages of the plants. In an area of 6. 16 ha of soybeans, a grid of 154 sampling points, spaced 20 × 20 m apart, was laid out. Population-density data were collected for nymphs and adults of the species Dichelops furcatus (Fabricius, 1775), Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood, 1873), Edessa meditabunda (Fabricius, 1794), Nezara viridula (Linnaeus, 1758), Euschistus heros (Fabricius, 1794) and Chinavia sp.

40|$|Abstract Background Before {{conducting}} a microarray experiment, one important issue {{that needs to}} be determined is the number of arrays required in order to have adequate power to identify differentially expressed genes. This paper discusses some crucial issues in the problem formulation, parameter specifications, and approaches that are commonly proposed for sample size estimation in microarray experiments. Common methods for sample size estimation are formulated as the minimum sample size necessary to achieve a specified sensitivity (proportion of detected truly differentially expressed genes) on average at a specified false discovery rate (FDR) level and specified expected proportion (π 1) of the true differentially expression genes in the array. Unfortunately, the probability of detecting the specified sensitivity in such a formulation can be low. We formulate the sample size problem as the number of arrays needed to achieve a specified sensitivity with 95 % probability at the specified significance level. A permutation method using a small pilot dataset to estimate sample size is proposed. This method accounts for correlation and effect size heterogeneity among genes. Results A sample size estimate based on the common formulation, to achieve the desired sensitivity on average, can be calculated using a univariate method without taking the correlation among genes into consideration. This formulation of sample size problem is inadequate because the probability of detecting the specified sensitivity can be lower than 50 %. On the other hand, the needed <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>calculated</b> by the proposed permutation method will ensure detecting at least the desired sensitivity with 95 % probability. The method is shown to perform well for a real example dataset using a small pilot dataset with 4 - 6 samples per group. Conclusions We recommend that the sample size problem should be formulated to detect a specified proportion of differentially expressed genes with 95 % probability. This formulation ensures finding the desired proportion of true positives with high probability. The proposed permutation method takes the correlation structure and effect size heterogeneity into consideration and works well using only a small pilot dataset. </p...|$|E
