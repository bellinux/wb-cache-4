50|$|Features a {{spinning}} set of blades, whose mount {{can be removed}} to form {{a spinning}}-blade weapon for the robot mode. It also includes a small, non-transforming Scorponok figure with a <b>spring-tail</b> that can be dropped from a basket in Blackouts helicopter mode. In vehicle mode, Blackout can combine with the Deluxe Class movie Scorponok figure (sold separately) in a combined gimmick: rotating Blackouts rotors will cause Scorponoks claws to spin. Blackout lacks the arm-mounted weapons seen in the film, but his robot mode does have sculpted missiles detailed on its shoulders. It is the smallest Voyager-class sized figure, despite his actual size in the movie being larger than the others. The figure has features based on a concept art image rather than the actual character from the movie.|$|E

5000|$|Templeton was {{particularly}} interested in the Thysanura and his first published entomological paper concerns these insects. Thysanurae hibernicae (Irish bristle tails and <b>spring-tails)</b> was published in the first volume of the Transactions of the Entomological Society of London for 1836 and is the first significant work in English on these primitive insects, remaining so until 1875. In this short work prefaced by John Obadiah Westwood Templeton described two new genera and twelve new species accompanied by two plates showing whole animals and details of structure. Forty years later the entomologist Lubbock paid tribute to Templeton's early work by naming a thysanuran genus after him [...] - [...] Templetonia.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Tree trunks are {{important}} {{links between the}} forest floor and canopy, especially for flightless invertebrates that move from the forest floor to feed or breed in the canopy. Traps were used to sample invertebrates {{moving up and down}} on mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), hard beech (Nothofagus truncata), and kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa). In 19 months 22 696 invertebrates were collected. Many unexpected groups e. g. ground wetas, ground beetles, some caterpillars, amphipods, <b>spring-tails,</b> mites, peripatus, and earthworms were caught in up-traps 1. 5 m above ground. Overall, up-traps caught more (80 %) invertebrates than down-traps (20 %) and 16 of 29 groups of invertebrates were caught more often in up-traps. Fewer invertebrates were caught on hard beech than on hinau with comparable catching surface area. The numbers of spiders caught were significantly correlated with tree circumference. The invertebrates caught fell broadly into 3 trophic levels-most were saprophytes, with equal numbers of herbivores and predators. Perched leaf litter in epiphytes and in tree cavities contain invertebrates otherwise associated with the forest floor. Invertebrates in the lowland forests of New Zealand appear to be generalists in their use of habitats (as many of them are saprophytes and predators) ...|$|R
