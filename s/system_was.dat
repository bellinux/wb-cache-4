5|$|A {{state highway}} was routed through {{downtown}} starting on May 13, 1913, when the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> created. It was first {{a part of}} M-15 when the highway <b>system</b> <b>was</b> signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft plan for the U.S. Highway System, US102 was the number assigned to run through Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} <b>system</b> <b>was</b> highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard <b>system</b> <b>was</b> built {{to create a}} park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E
5|$|An {{electronic}} {{toll collection}} <b>system</b> <b>was</b> proposed in 1990 where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device which would be read from an electronic tollbooth; the motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, E-ZPass, was planned {{to go into effect}} by 1998; however, implementation of the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> postponed until 2000.|$|E

5|$|As the VOR <b>system</b> <b>was</b> {{phased in}} around the world, the LFR was {{gradually}} phased out, mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no remaining operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00a.m. on August 1, 1944 most trolleys, {{buses and}} subways in Philadelphia stopped running. Strike {{agitators}} blocked access to PTC depos with vehicles and advised the arriving workers of a sickout strike. By noon of August 1 the entire PTC transportation <b>system</b> <b>was</b> paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first <b>system</b> <b>was</b> designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second <b>system</b> <b>was</b> developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This <b>system</b> <b>was</b> simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat <b>system</b> <b>was</b> selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting <b>system</b> <b>was</b> tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the <b>system</b> <b>was</b> slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E

5|$|Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site {{along the}} River Derwent in Derbyshire, England, {{designated}} in December 2001. It {{is administered by}} the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or 'mill', <b>system</b> <b>was</b> born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements in technology, it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The <b>system</b> <b>was</b> adopted throughout the valley, and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a state space design method of delayed inverse systems. First, a state space design method of delayed inverse systems for minimum phase <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> presented.

Second, the stable delayed inverse <b>system</b> <b>is</b> defined {{so as to}} design the delayed inverse systems for the non-minimum phase systems such that the delayed inverse <b>system</b> <b>is</b> stable. Finally, a state space design method of the stable delayed inverse <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> proposed...|$|R

5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a <b>system</b> <b>was</b> followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this <b>system</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway <b>system</b> <b>was</b> first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway <b>System</b> <b>was</b> created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway <b>system</b> <b>was</b> first {{numbered}}, the main north–south highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway <b>System</b> <b>was</b> created. By the next year, M-24 was designated from downtown Pontiac northward to Lapeer. M-24 was moved to an eastern bypass of town in 1936, and the former routing in town became M-24A. This was redesignated Bus M-24 in 1940.|$|E
