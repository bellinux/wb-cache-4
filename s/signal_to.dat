5|$|Aposematism is {{exploited}} in Müllerian mimicry, where {{species with}} strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the warning <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> predators is shared, {{causing them to}} learn more quickly at less of a cost {{to each of the}} species.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B were {{functionally}} {{similar in}} design to the Spectrum +2A and +3. The main electronic differences being {{changes to the}} generation of the audio output <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> resolve problems with clipping.|$|E
25|$|The angular {{positions}} of gimbals on their axes were measured by resolvers, which sent their <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the LVDA. The LVDA was the input/output device for the LVDC. It performed the necessary processing of <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> make these <b>signals</b> acceptable <b>to</b> the LVDC.|$|R

5|$|WRGP Radiate FM is FIU's student-run {{radio station}} since 1984. It {{broadcasts}} on 95.3MHz at the University Park Campus and on 96.9MHz at the Biscayne Bay Campus. The signal originates in Homestead on 88.1MHz and a broadcast translator rebroadcasts WRGP's <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> the University Park Campus and later again translated to the Biscayne Bay Campus.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
30|$|The two-way relay {{transmission}} process between node A and node B occurs in three phases, and relay node R processes its received signals using DF relaying. In the first phase, node A transmits its <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> node R. Then, node B transmits its <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> node R {{in the second}} phase. Finally, the relay decodes and encodes its received signals from node A and node B before broadcasting these <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the two terminals in the third phase.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, in the {{indirect}} pathway, the motor cortices send activating <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the caudate and putamen. The cells of {{the indirect}} pathway in the caudate and putamen that receive these signals are inhibitory and, once activated, they send inhibitory <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the globus pallidus externus, reducing the activity in that nucleus. The globus pallidus externus normally sends inhibitory <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the subthalamic nucleus. On activation of the indirect pathway, these inhibitory signals are reduced, which allows more activation of the subthalamic nucleus. Subthalamic nucleus cells can then send more activating <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> {{some parts of the}} globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Thus, parts of these two nuclei are driven to send more inhibitory <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, which prevents the development of significant activity in the motor cerebral cortices. This behavior prevents the activation of motor cortical areas that would compete with the voluntary movement.|$|R
50|$|Broca's area is {{involved}} {{mostly in the}} production of speech. Given its proximity to the motor cortex, neurons from Broca's area send <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the larynx, tongue and mouth motor areas, which in turn send the <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the corresponding muscles, thus allowing the creation of sounds.|$|R
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E

5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E
5|$|Following his Navy service {{he worked}} at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) until 1986 as an {{engineering}} contractor for Allied Bendix Aerospace working on the Deep Space Network project, as well as on several spacecraft projects. During the 1986 Voyager 2 fly-by of Uranus, he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft carrier <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> deduce information about Uranus’ atmosphere and rings.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> the point where LIDAR data can be collected {{at any time of}} the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E

2500|$|The pterygopalatine ganglia are ganglia (one on each side) of {{the soft}} palate. The greater petrosal, lesser palatine [...] and {{zygomatic}} nerves all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the nasal cavity; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the lacrimal nerve that activate the lacrimal gland; which {{is the reason that}} spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are maxillary nerves (from the trigeminal nerve).|$|R

5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic <b>signal,</b> <b>to</b> warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, New Zealand's {{independent}} environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, made a {{submission to}} the Select Committee considering National's {{amendments to the}} NZ ETS.

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear.

However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E

5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
