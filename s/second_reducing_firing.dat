We find that repeated forest fires cause house prices to decrease for houses located near the fires. We test and reject the hypothesis that the house price reduction from the first fire is equal to the house price reduction from the second fire. The first <b>fire</b> <b>reduces</b> house prices by about 10 %, while the <b>second</b> <b>fire</b> <b>reduces</b> house prices by nearly 23 %, a statistically significant difference...|$|R
30|$|Madany (1981) {{calculated}} that pre-Euro-American ponderosa pine tree density within Zion approximated 100 trees ha− 1. By contrast, {{we found that}} the pre-prescribed fire, contemporary stand density of overstory and midstory ponderosa pine within Zion was 302 trees ha− 1, {{more than three times the}} pre-settlement density. The Zion Fire Management Plan states that ponderosa pine overstory reduction by 30 % to 60 % is the main objective of prescribed fire treatments in the ponderosa pine forest (USDI NPS 2005). First entry <b>fires</b> <b>reduced</b> overstory and midstory pine densities by just 10 %, and the <b>second</b> entry <b>fires</b> <b>reduced</b> the density by 24 %. While second entry density reductions were not statistically significant, the actual densities approximate those observed historically and are relatively close to the minimum density reduction objective of 30 %. Ponderosa pine basal area did not change after the first or second entry fires, indicating that primarily smaller trees were removed by the burns; this also meets the Zion objective of primarily removing trees within the 10.2 cm to 30.5 cm diameter classes.|$|R

40|$|AbstractReduction of {{fire hazard}} is {{becoming}} increasingly important in managed landscapes globally. Fuels reduction prescribed burn treatments {{are the most common}} form of <b>reducing</b> <b>fire</b> hazard on landscapes around the world but often result in homogenized fuel age structures and habitats. Alternatively, the size of unplanned fires, and hence fire hazard, can be reduced by controlling the size and patterning of fuels treatments in a patch mosaic arrangement on landscapes. Patch mosaic burning is being implemented globally as a means to increase heterogeneity to mimic natural fire regime results. Funding for prescribed fire programs is often justified primarily on hazardous fuels reduction with secondary consideration given for ecological effectiveness, which can be increased by particular fire mosaic patterns in some systems. The question we address is: Which of two prescribed fire treatment regimes, fuels reduction or patch mosaic burning, <b>reduces</b> <b>fire</b> hazard most effectively? We address the question using computer simulation modeling on synthetic landscapes representing both fire regime treatments. Treatment scale was important. Among fuel reduction treatments, large blocks burned less area than small blocks. For the mosaic treatments, small blocks <b>reduced</b> <b>fire</b> size the most (out of all treatments) and had the least variance in area burned. It is possible to <b>reduce</b> <b>fire</b> hazard and to provide heterogeneous age fuels structure on the landscape, simultaneously benefiting humans and many native fire-dependent species requiring mosaic habitat patterns...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{managers}} have a standard {{set of tools}} they use to <b>reduce</b> <b>fire</b> hazard: mechanical thinning, brush clearing, mechanical treatment of slash (small woody debris), prescribed fire, and various combinations and timings {{of the use of}} these tools. Although these tools are widely used, the science is sketchy on the benefits and tradeoffs of the different treatments. In response, the national Fire and Fire Surrogates Study (FFS) set up a national network of research sites to study the effects of fire “surrogates,” such as mechanical thinning, mechanical slash treatments, and prescribed fire on forests. Early findings for the Sierra Nevada FFS site are reported here. The study used four treatments: prescribedfire- only, mechanical-only, mechanical-plus-fire, and no-treatment controls. All three active fuel treatments significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>fire</b> risk, but the two treatments that used prescribed <b>fire</b> to <b>reduce</b> surface fuels achieved the greatest reductions in potential fire behavior. The mechanical-only treatment (mechanical thinning followed by mechanical slash treatment) reduced crown bulk density and ladder fuels but increased surface fuels, and it was less effective in <b>reducing</b> <b>fire</b> risk. The active treatments also had noticeably different consequences on forest structure and predicted tree mortality. A pretreatment assessment can determine the level of fire hazard from the surface, ladder, and crown fuels, and a prescription can be designed to treat the fuel layers creating the ris...|$|R
40|$|Extensive beetle {{outbreaks}} across western North American forests have spurred {{debates about}} how to best protect communities from wildfire. Previous work has found that fuels in the wildland–urban interface {{and especially in the}} defensible space (40 -m radius) around structures are the most important determinants of the flammability of structures during wildfire. We: (1) examined the extent of outbreaks in the western US and their intersection with the wildland-urban interface and its surrounding area and (2) calculated the combined area of defensible space around all wildland-urban interface housing units in the western US. This analysis indicates that: (1). 98 % of areas affected by outbreaks are in remote areas rather than in the wildland-urban interface and (2) in the context of limited resources and the goal of protecting homes and communities from wildfire, the area required to create defensible space around all homes in the wildland-urban interface of the western US (which effectively <b>reduces</b> <b>fire</b> risk to structures) is substantially less than that needed to treat all beetle-affected forests (which does not <b>reduce</b> <b>fire</b> risk to structures as effectively). Thus, focussing fuel- reduction treatments in the immediate vicinity of homes and communities rather than in remote beetle-affected forests would be more effective at <b>reducing</b> <b>fire</b> risk to those structures and would incur lower financial and ecological costs...|$|R
