5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, <b>should</b> <b>find</b> the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter <b>should</b> <b>find</b> a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she <b>should</b> <b>find</b> another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

25|$|On January 3 and 4 Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ursula Plassnik {{supported}} {{resumption of}} gas supplies by Gazprom and emphasized that a lasting solution was preferable to unilateral measures. On January 4 Poland presented {{the position of}} Visegrád Group countries alongside Austria during a special EU meeting. The statement included the opinion that demanding higher prices by blocking gas deliveries was acceptable and that the EU <b>should</b> <b>find</b> other sources.|$|E
25|$|In August 1945, just a {{few days}} after the Hiroshima bombing, Sweden’s Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Helge Jung, made a request via newly {{appointed}} research officer Torsten Schmidt that the recently founded FOA <b>should</b> <b>find</b> out what was known about those new weapons. FOA's first report to the Commander-in-Chief in late 1945 was largely based on the Smyth Report, the official US report on Manhattan project and physics behind it, was published on August 12.|$|E
25|$|Carotenoids may absorb {{solar energy}} and convert it to ATP, {{the first example}} of photoheterotrophy in animals. The {{carotene}} pigments in aphids form a layer {{close to the surface}} of the cuticle, where it is ideally placed to absorb sunlight. The excited carotenoids seem to reduce NAD to NADH which can then be oxidized in the mitochondria for energy. It is unclear why aphids <b>should</b> <b>find</b> it necessary to develop this source of energy when their diet provides them with an excess of sugars.|$|E

25|$|We {{shall not}} say more {{concerning}} the corrective process afforded to the petitioners than {{that it does}} not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void. We have confined the statement to facts admitted by the demurrer. We will not say that they cannot be met, but it appears to us unavoidable that the District Judge <b>should</b> <b>find</b> whether the facts alleged are true and whether they can be explained so far as to leave the state proceedings undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone <b>should</b> <b>find</b> it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E
25|$|The twin {{paradox is}} a thought {{experiment}} involving identical twins, {{one of whom}} makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home {{to find that the}} twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each <b>should</b> <b>find</b> the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock. Nevertheless, the twin paradox is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.|$|E

25|$|In 1818, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was {{appointed}} Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at Bencoolen. Raffles {{believed that the}} British <b>should</b> <b>find</b> a way to challenge {{the dominance of the}} Dutch in the area. The trade route between China and British India passed through the Malacca Strait, and with the growing trade with China, that route would become increasingly important. However, the Dutch had tight control over the trade in the region and intended to enforce the exclusive rights of its company ships to trade, and that trade should be conducted at its entrepot Batavia. British trading ships were heavily taxed at Dutch ports, stifling British trade in the region.|$|E

On March 31, 2006, she spoke at a criminology conference at the University of Pennsylvania. She stated that she believed the education system in the United States needs to be improved, {{as there is a}} link between the quality of education and the crime rate. She also believed that too much money has been diverted away from the juvenile court system and that the government <b>should</b> <b>find</b> some way to make the juvenile courts work effectively, so as to prevent problems in troubled children and adolescents before these problems are exacerbated by the time they reach adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the theatre}} is morally innocuous, Rousseau argues, its {{presence}} is disruptive to potentially productive use of time. Moreover, theatre {{is incompatible with}} the rural mindset, where people work hard, {{and as a result}} <b>should</b> <b>find</b> simple relaxation pleasurable, rather than the extravagant, over-stimulating entertainment which retards the imagination. A theatre in Geneva would cause the hardworking people to be distracted and pre-occupied if they were to develop a taste for it. Though a theatre can work to distract the masses of the cities from crime, it is of no use to a smaller city like Geneva, which is relatively innocent. Rousseau also describes the weather and geography of Geneva, and argues that it is not particularly conducive to supporting a theatre.|$|E

25|$|Symbolic racism {{represents}} {{a form of}} resistance {{to change in the}} racial status quo based on moral feelings that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance, the work ethic, obedience, and discipline. Whites may feel that people should be rewarded on their merits, which in turn should be based on hard work and diligent service. Hence symbolic racism <b>should</b> <b>find</b> its most vociferous expression on political issues that involve 'unfair' government assistance to blacks: welfare ('welfare cheats could find work if they tried'); 'reverse discrimination' and racial quotas ('blacks should not be given a status they have not earned'); 'forced' busing ('whites have worked hard for their neighborhoods, and for their neighborhood schools'); or 'free' abortions for the poor ('if blacks behaved morally, they would not need abortions').|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders <b>should</b> <b>find</b> that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E
