50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the <b>shaving</b> <b>tool</b> to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E
50|$|Shaving {{removes a}} small amount of {{material}} around the edges of a previously blanked stampings or piercing. A straight, smooth edge is provided and therefore shaving is frequently performed on instrument parts, watch and clock parts and the like.

50|$|The {{mechanics}} of a beard trimmer involves rotatory mechanics, crafted with a mini size motor, which rounds {{at a very}} fast speed. This motor causes two sets of hinged blades to {{move back and forth}} past one another allowing for the hair cuticles to be cut. The main advantage of a beard trimmer, unlike other <b>shaving</b> <b>tools</b> is that you can trim longer beards to a short length efficiently and effectively.|$|R

40|$|The term “cutting tool” in fact {{covers a}} very large variety of tools: turning tools, drill bits, planer tools and {{slotting}} <b>tools,</b> scraping or <b>shaving</b> <b>tools,</b> drill spindles, milling cutters, facing cutters, recessing tools, reamers, taps and dies, files, and grinding wheels. HSS cutting tool was commonly used for turning process for manufacturing. At common market there is many large selection of HSS tool steel with different type and mark. One of them was HSS tool steel made in Germany and Taiwan which share the same trade mark but have significant differences at price. At this paper our testing focused on comparation between HSS tool steel made in German and the one made in Taiwan which we can commonly found at the market. Our testing consist of hardness test, micrography test and chemical composition test. By that test we want to obtain which HSS more reliable for manufacturing process. The specimen were BOHLER MO RAPID EXTRA 1200 with ¼”x 1 / 4 ” x 4 ” made in Taiwan and the one Made in Germany. The result showing that HSS cutting tool Made in Germany has 64, 42 HRC and HSS Taiwan has 62, 35 HRC. HSS Germany contain martensite and carbida and HSS Taiwan contain martensite, retained austenite in micrography. Key Words :	Cutting tool, HSS, Germany, Taiwan...|$|R

Fronting the stove, and very close to it, was a sort of narrow shelf, where he used to sit with his legs spread out very wide, to keep them from scorching; and there, with his book in one hand, and a pewter spoon in the other, he sat all that Sunday morning, {{stirring}} up his pots, and studying away at the same time; seldom taking his eye off the page. Reading must have been very hard work for him; for he muttered to himself quite loud as he read; and big drops of sweat would stand upon his brow, and roll off, till they hissed on the hot stove before him. But on the day I speak of, it was no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious passage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read, he called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over, demanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could explain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left him poring over it still.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge,Attitude and Practice of the Internally Displaced People in Khartoum state about HIV/AIDSBackground : Acquired Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has {{referred}} {{only to the}} latest stage of the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Although HIV/AIDS is still low in the North African countries in general, its visible trend is towards increasing {{in many of these}} countries. Sudan is one of three North African countries (together with Somalia, and Djibouti), which at the verge of the rapid spread of the infection. The study assessed the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice about HIV/AIDS of the IDPs living in three camps in Khartoum state (Mandela, Wad elbashIier, Panteo) from September _October 2007. Methodology: descriptive, cross-sectional, community based study was done in three IDPs camps in Khartoum, a sample of 98 was selected by stratified selection, a questionnaire was interviewed with IDPs, then data was analyzed using computer using (SPSS). Results and Discussion: It was found that the majority of respondents didn’t know the causative agent of AIDS, the respondent showed a very good knowledge about different routs of HIV transmission, but still there were large numbers of them have a misconception that mosquito and cough could transmit the disease, also it was yield a very good knowledge about different ways of HIV prevention except for condom use which the majority showed no idea about it. About practice the majority of respondent practiced sex, and also the majority practiced it with only one partner and the majority of respondent weren’t dealing with traditional medicine using sharp tools and also didn’t share shaving instrument while the majority of them practiced sex with their husbands or wives and few of them practiced out of marriage. About the respondent attitude towards HIV testing; majority of them said it must before marriage and for the tow partners, but some of them thought that testing had to be done only when we felt ill. Also the majority said that they were ready for caring of an HIV +ve person at home and playing, eating and sharing him the same but not his <b>shaving</b> <b>tools.</b> Conclusion; knowledge of the IDPs HIV/AIDS is very good except some of misconceptions concerning causative agent routs of transmission and ways of prevention, the attitude of IDPs towards HIV +ve people was very good, while Practices of IDPs are very safe, but condom use as a way of preventing wasn’t used by the respondent. It is recommended to increase the quality of health educational activities,conduction of courses about HIV/AIDS for the local chives and establishment of local counseling and testing centers inside the camps...|$|R
