5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> {{the lack of a}} black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

50|$|Vitreous {{china is}} an enamel coating that {{is applied to}} ceramics, {{particularly}} porcelain, after they've been fired, though the name can also refer to the finished piece as a whole. The coating makes the porcelain tougher, denser, <b>and</b> <b>shinier,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is a common}} choice for things like toilets and sink basins.|$|R
25|$|The {{high level}} of {{craftsmanship}} reflected on this sculpture demonstrate the lifelikeness and physical characteristics that this horse is supposed to embody: a handsome adult horse with an athletic body and a body of mane that is smooth, <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> neat. Its posture is upright, its eyes are wide-opened and its head cocked at an angle that is upright but not facing upward.|$|E
25|$|The {{average time}} of {{development}} from Egg to adult at 30 degrees celsius is 20.5 days. The eggs of most species are off-white and oval in shape. The egg takes on average 3.8 days +/- 0.02 {{to develop into}} the first instar. The chorion is <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> smooth. In certain species like epirerus or platylomalus it can look pale brown and be leathery in texture.|$|E
25|$|Swing {{balls are}} bowled {{with the same}} grip and {{technique}} as fast balls although the seam is usually angled slightly rather than straight, and the slower ball grip may be used. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball will spin in flight, varying {{the orientation of the}} <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more than the white ball used in the one-day game.|$|E

25|$|Reverse swing is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball swing {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of the <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball will swing towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman will have in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a ball will always exhibit reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|E
500|$|Moore made {{a larger}} and {{reversed}} version of the sculpture, Mirror Knife Edge 1977 or Knife Edge Mirror Two Piece (LH 714) – which is 5.34x7.21x3.63m or about 17.5x23.7x11.9 feet and weighs about [...] – which was commissioned for the entrance to I. M. Pei's east wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The work is carefully cleaned and conserved each year to maintain the distinction between its <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> patinated surfaces, as the artist intended.|$|E
500|$|The coins were officially {{released}} to circulation on March 4, 1913, and quickly gained positive comments as depicting truly American themes. [...] However, The New York Times stated {{in an editorial}} that [...] "The new 'nickel' is a striking example of what a coin intended for wide circulation should not be... is not pleasing to look at when new and <b>shiny,</b> <b>and</b> will be an abomination when old and dull." [...] The Numismatist, in March and May 1913 editorials, gave the new coin a lukewarm review, suggesting that the Indian's head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse.|$|E

500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of Steven Spielberg, an [...] "über-alien" [...] was also designed. It was unclear if the red scar Jake gives the über-alien after escaping vivisection would be enough of an identifier to distinguish it from other aliens, so the creature was redesigned with translucent, pale skin {{due to the lack}} of time spent outside. Favreau described the über-alien as more fleshy and anthropomorphic than the other aliens and Murphy commented, [...] "There are some parts of him like his arm that you can see into. It's almost like glass or ice or gelatiny surface that blends into a dryer area. The [...] there's pieces of him that are more like a soft-shell crab or <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> wet." ...|$|E
500|$|Acacia pycnantha {{generally}} grows as a {{small tree}} to between [...] in height, though trees of up to [...] high {{have been reported in}} Morocco. The bark is generally dark brown to grey—smooth in younger plants though it can be furrowed and rough in older plants. Branchlets may be bare and smooth or covered with a white bloom. [...] The mature trees do not have true leaves but have phyllodes—flat and widened leaf stems—that hang down from the branches. <b>Shiny</b> <b>and</b> dark green, these are between [...] long, [...] wide and falcate (sickle-shaped) to [...] in shape. New growth has a bronze coloration. Field observations at Hale Conservation Park show the bulk of new growth to take place over spring and summer from October to January.|$|E
500|$|Tremella mesenterica [...] is {{frequently}} confused with Tremella aurantia, a widespread species parasitic {{on the plant}} pathogenic fungus Stereum hirsutum. Tremella aurantia can often be recognized {{by the presence of}} its host, which typically grows on logs, stumps, and trunks. Though the two species are similarly colored, the surface of T.aurantia is usually matte, not greasy or <b>shiny,</b> <b>and</b> its lobes or folds are thicker than those of T.mesenterica. Fruit bodies of T.aurantia contain unclamped, thick-walled host hyphae and consequently retain their shape when dried, rather than shriveling or collapsing to a film (as in T. mesenterica). Microscopically, T.aurantia has smaller basidia and smaller, differently shaped spores measuring 8.5–10 by 7–8.5µm. T.brasiliensis, known from neotropical areas and Japan, and the North American species T.mesenterella are also similar.|$|E
50|$|Myoporum caprarioides is an erect shrub which {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 2 m and has wart-like tubercles {{covering}} its branches and leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately and are flat, not succulent, 17-70 mm long and 3.5-13 mm wide. They are elliptic in shape with minute serrations on the edges. The upper surface is <b>shinier</b> <b>and</b> darker than the lower surface which has a raised midrib.|$|R

500|$|Periodontal abscesses {{are less}} common than apical abscesses, {{but are still}} frequent. [...] The key {{difference}} between the two is that the pulp of the tooth tends to be alive, and will respond normally to pulp tests. However, an untreated periodontal abscess may still cause the pulp to die if it reaches the tooth apex in a periodontic-endodontic lesion. A periodontal abscess can occur as the result of tooth fracture, food packing into a periodontal pocket (with poorly shaped fillings), calculus build-up, and lowered immune responses (such as in diabetes). [...] Periodontal abscess can also occur after periodontal scaling, which causes the gums to tighten around the teeth and trap debris in the pocket. Toothache caused by a periodontal abscess is generally deep and throbbing. The oral mucosa covering an early periodontal abscess appears erythematous (red), swollen, <b>shiny,</b> <b>and</b> painful to touch.|$|E
500|$|Minogue's tenth record X was a {{move back}} to her pop roots. In a press {{interview}} {{for the promotion of}} the album, she stated that the album was [...] "mainly electropop" [...] and was a [...] "celebration for me to be back working." [...] However, critics said the album did not feature enough [...] "consistency" [...] and Chris True called the tracks [...] "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers." [...] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite [...] "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" [...] and [...] "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, [...] "The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting <b>shiny</b> <b>and</b> sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" [...] and found Aphrodite [...] "One of her best, in fact." ...|$|E
500|$|The caps of {{the fruit}} bodies {{initially}} have a convex shape before flattening out in maturity, and measure [...] in diameter. The cap surface is dry to <b>shiny,</b> <b>and</b> white with a pale orange hue. It is densely covered with white to pale orange or reddish-brown conical warts. The warts, remnants of the universal veil, are randomly distributed on the cap surface and become fluffier and cotton-like (...) near the edge (or margin) of the cap. Drier specimens may have the cap surface completely cracked around the bases of the individual warts.The conical warts are detersile, meaning they may be easily removed from the cap surface without leaving a residue or a scar. The margin of the cap does not have , and like other Lepidella members, may have irregular veil remnants hanging from it. The gills are free, crowded closely together, moderately narrow, and white to yellowish white in color. The short gills that do not extend the full distance from the stem to the cap edge (known as lamellulae) are rounded to attenuate (gradually narrowing), and of varying lengths.|$|E
