40|$|Aspheric {{surfaces}} {{have become}} {{widely used in}} various fields ranging from imaging systems to energy and biomedical applications. Although many researches have been conducted to address their manufacturing and measurement, there are still challenges in form characterization of aspheric surfaces considering {{a large number of}} data points. This paper presents a comparative study of 3 D measurement and form characterization of an aspheric lens using tactile and optical <b>single</b> scanning <b>probing</b> <b>systems.</b> The design of the LNE high precision profilometer, traceable to standard references is presented. The measured surfaces are obtained from the aforementioned system. They are characterized with large number of data points for which a suitable process chain is deployed. The form characterization of the aspheric surfaces is based on surface fitting techniques by comparing the measured surface with the design surface. A comparative study of registration methods and non-linear Orthogonal Least-Squares fitting Methods is presented. Experimental results are analyzed and discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. EMR...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study was developed about {{the applicability of}} a double <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> consisting of two directional Langmuir probes, both probes being located separately in a plasma column. The current- voltage characteristic of the double probe was obtained considering a plasma with a drifting maxwellian electron velocity distribution function and stationary ion background. In deriving the characteristic of the double probe, the plasma parameters, namely, electron temperature (Te), electron density (Ne), electron drift velocity (Vde) and plasma potential (Vp) {{are assumed to be}} non-uniform. The double probe characteristic is also dependent on the angle between the axial direction of the electron drift and the normal to the collecting area of the probe. Each probe can be rotated such that this angle can be varied between zero and 180 degrees. Various probe characteristics were simulated using plasma parameters obtained by independent <b>single</b> <b>probe</b> measurements in the positive column of a low-pressure arc discharge in mercury vapor. Typical parameters of the positive column, used in the simulation, are: Te = 5 eV, Ne = 10 (17) m- 3, v de = 8 x 10 (5) ms- 1. Experimental characteristics of the double probe were obtained and compared with the simulated results, showing good agreement. It is concluded that this directional <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> can be a reliable diagnostic tool especially for studies of non-uniform plasmas...|$|R

It’s used for obtaining micro-displacement in three directions through the deformation of the three mutually vertical parallel springs. The accuracy of the <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> has critical influence on Gear Measuring Center. Because of the limitation of the structure of parallel spring, the installation errors of the probe and the influence of environmental factors, the parallel springs in three directions are not always strictly vertical, the interference and coupling among X,Y,Z directions exist. This problem is very difficult to be solved by adjusting the mechanical structure of 3 D scanning <b>probe</b> <b>system.</b> However, the accuracy of <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> can be improved by adopting software-compensation through calibration. In the paper, the calibration matrix of the <b>probe</b> <b>system</b> is generated by fitting the points sampled on the standard ball with the method of the least square. The points are sampled through controlling the probe to touch standard ball in several given directions. The experimental results show that the measurement errors caused by the coupling among the three perpendicular directions can be effectively decreased by the coefficient matrix mentioned above.
