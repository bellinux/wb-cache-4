5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond <b>should</b> <b>share</b> revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife <b>should</b> <b>share</b> equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E

Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each <b>should</b> <b>share</b> in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E

5|$|Jon Haraldsson {{was killed}} in 1231, at Thurso in Caithness. He was contested by Snaekoll Gunnisson, a {{great-grandson}} of Rognvald Kali, who had demanded that Jon <b>should</b> <b>share</b> the Earldom with him, as had been done before. Jon's supporters and Snaekoll's fought a war until {{it was agreed that}} King Haakon Sverreson should settle the matter. All concerned set off to Norway, but a ship carrying Earl Jon, his supporters, and his kin, was lost at sea on the return voyage. As a result, the line of Norse Earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 Orkney was without an Earl. In 1236 the Earldom was granted by Haakon IV of Norway, to Magnus, son of Gille Brigte, Mormaer of Angus. Although ruled by Angus, Strathearn and Sinclair lords thereafter, Orkney remained part of the kingdom of Norway.|$|E
5|$|In Prague, the {{emergence}} of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the Royal Landstheater fortunes. Mahler's task was to help arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated {{for the rest of}} his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven's Ninth for the first time in his life. By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch almost began at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two <b>should</b> <b>share</b> conducting duties for the theatre's new production of Wagner's Ring cycle. Nikisch's illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except Götterdämmerung), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, win him popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.|$|E

25|$|Indra is {{a popular}} {{guardian}} deity in Buddhism, who protects Buddhist teachings and believers. He is commonly found in the Buddhist art works in both the Theravada and Mahayana traditions all over South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia. He also appears extensively in ancient and medieval Buddhist literature such as the Buddhacarita and the Mahavamsa. Indra is the god who urges the Buddha to go teach mankind, after he had achieved his enlightenment under a bodhi tree but had doubts whether he <b>should</b> <b>share</b> his knowledge. Other texts depict Indra as the most devoted of divine disciples of the Buddha, who listens and follows the Buddha, and the deity who renders assistance to the Buddha and his followers on numerous occasions.|$|E
25|$|Phoebe orbits {{the planet}} at a {{distance}} ranging from 180 to 250 radii. The ring has a thickness of about 40 radii. Because the ring's particles are presumed to have originated from impacts (micrometeoroid and larger) on Phoebe, they <b>should</b> <b>share</b> its retrograde orbit, which is opposite to the orbital motion of the next inner moon, Iapetus. This ring lies in the plane of Saturn's orbit, or roughly the ecliptic, and thus is tilted 27 degrees from Saturn's equatorial plane and the other rings. Phoebe is inclined by 5° with respect to Saturn's orbit plane (often written as 175°, due to Phoebe's retrograde orbital motion), and its resulting vertical excursions {{above and below the}} ring plane agree closely with the ring's observed thickness of 40 Saturn radii.|$|E
25|$|Spectra {{were taken}} at Keck {{corresponding}} to 20, 25, and 26 days after maximum {{light in the}} B-band. So little evolution was observed between these spectra {{that they were all}} combined in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and study less pronounced features. Fe II still dominates the spectrum. The Ca II infrared triplet is weak in SN 2002cx as compared to other type Ia supernovae, as expected since the Ca II H & K line is also weak in SN 2002cx. Unlike other type Ia supernova, SN 2002cx has double-peaked emission lines which may be due to jet-like emissions or rotating ejecta, or may simply only be seen in SN 2002cx because its low expansion velocity does not wash them out. The emission or ejecta hypothesis is considered less likely because if it were the case all the peaks <b>should</b> <b>share</b> equal separation, which they do not. SN 2002cx has absorption and emission lines between 6400 Å and 7000 Å that are unique among previously discovered type Ia supernovae.|$|E

25|$|He was {{conscious}} of the stressful loneliness of command. He knew of the suicides both of Captain Stokes and of his uncle Viscount Castlereagh, who had cut his own throat in 1822 while in government office. FitzRoy talked to Beaufort in August 1831, asking him to find a suitable gentleman companion for the voyage. Such a companion <b>should</b> <b>share</b> his scientific tastes, {{make good use of}} the expedition's opportunities for researching natural history, dine with him as an equal, and provide a semblance of normal human friendship. While those Beaufort first approached (including Professor J. S. Henslow of the University of Cambridge) turned the opportunity down, FitzRoy eventually approved Charles Darwin for the position. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, a book the captain had read that explained terrestrial features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods. FitzRoy took a request from Lyell to record observations on geological features, such as erratic boulders.|$|E

One Yule Eve, he set off in a ten-oar boat to Orphir on Mainland, Orkney at the invitation of the Earl of Orkney, Paul Haakonsson. However, the boat was lost with all hands– as the Saga puts it, [...] "sad news as Valthiof was a most accomplished man". The Earl later granted Valthiof's farm to Thorkel Flettir. Later, a rowdy Viking named Sweyn Asleifsson fled to Stroma, pursued by Earl Harald Haakonsson.

500|$|Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mark her as a rigid thinker. Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good.

Although she attacked Rousseau's works, Grenby argues that she agreed with [...] "Rousseau's key idea, later {{taken up by the}} Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early", in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon. Trimmer also maintained that mothers and fathers <b>should</b> <b>share</b> the responsibility of caring for the family. Like the progressive educational reformers and children's authors Maria Edgeworth and Thomas Day and even Rousseau himself, Trimmer opposed rote learning and advocated flexible and conversational lessons that encouraged critical thinking in children. She also promoted breastfeeding (a controversial position at the time) and parental involvement in childhood education.|$|E
