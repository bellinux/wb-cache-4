5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit <b>some</b> <b>flexibility</b> or vice versa. Two constants that are found in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming variable and unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can very complicated, with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and Coleoptera, and in some insects the anal area can be folded like a fan.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to <b>some</b> <b>flexibility</b> in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with <b>some</b> <b>flexibility.</b> It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E

40|$|In many {{automated}} {{methods for}} proving inductive theorems, finding a suitable generalization of a conjecture {{is a key}} {{for the success of}} proof attempts. On the other hand, an obtained generalized conjecture may not be a theorem, and in this case hopeless proof attempts for the incorrect conjecture are made, which is against the success and efficiency of theorem proving. Urso and Kounalis (2004) proposed a generalization method for proving inductive validity of equations, called sound generalization, that avoids such an over-generalization. Their method guarantees that if the original conjecture is an inductive theorem then so is the obtained generalization. In this paper, we revise and extend their method. We restore a condition on one of the characteristic argument positions imposed in their previous paper and show that otherwise there exists a counterexample to their main theorem. We also relax a condition imposed in their framework and add <b>some</b> <b>flexibilities</b> to <b>some</b> of other characteristic argument positions so as to enlarge the scope of the technique...|$|R

On the other hand, the signaling theory explains that goodwill impairment losses is considered as bad news by investors because it relates to the decrease of the firm’s ability to generate cash inflow in the future, that will ultimately affect the value of the firm.
