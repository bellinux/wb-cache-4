50|$|There {{are certain}} inhibitors that {{resemble}} the tetrahedral intermediate, and thus {{fill up the}} active site, preventing the enzyme from working properly.

50|$|Debridement is {{the medical}} removal of dead, damaged, or {{infected}} tissue {{to improve the}} healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. Removal may be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (<b>self-digestion),</b> and by maggot therapy, where certain species of live maggots selectively eat only necrotic tissue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first stage}} is autolysis, more {{commonly}} known as <b>self-digestion,</b> during which the body's cells are destroyed through the action of their own digestive enzymes. However, these enzymes are released into the cells because of active processes ceasing in the cells, not as an active process. In other words, though autolysis resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells, the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed in popular literature and as the synonym of autolysis <b>self-digestion</b> seems to imply. As a result of autolysis, liquid is created that gets between the layers of skin and makes the skin peel off. During this stage, flies (when present) start to lay eggs in the openings of the body: eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, open wounds, and other orifices. Hatched larvae, (maggots) of blowflies, subsequently get under the skin and start to eat the body.|$|E
50|$|Alternative pathway of {{endogenous}} {{antigen processing}} and presentation over MHC-II molecules exists in medulary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) via {{the process of}} autophagy. It {{is important for the}} process of central tolerance of T cells in particular the negative selection of autoreactive clones. Random gene expression of the whole genome is achieved via the action of AIRE and a <b>self-digestion</b> of the expressed molecules presented on both MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.|$|E
50|$|Zymogens are {{the usually}} {{inactive}} precursors of an enzyme. If the digestive enzymes were active when synthesized, they would immediately start chewing up the synthesizing organs and tissues. Acute pancreatitis {{is such a}} condition, {{in which there is}} premature activation of the digestive enzymes in the pancreas, resulting in <b>self-digestion</b> (autolysis). It also complicates postmortem investigations, as the pancreas often digests itself before it can be assessed visually.|$|E
50|$|Activation of trypsin from {{proteolytic}} cleavage of trypsinogen in {{the pancreas}} {{can lead to}} a series of events that cause pancreatic <b>self-digestion,</b> resulting in pancreatitis. One consequence of the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis is a deficiency in transport of trypsin and other digestive enzymes from the pancreas.

This disorder involves intestinal obstruction (ileus) due to overly thick meconium, which is normally broken down by trypsin and other proteases, then passed in feces.|$|E
50|$|Abnormal {{proteolytic}} {{activity is}} associated with many diseases. In pancreatitis, leakage of proteases and their premature activation in the pancreas results in the <b>self-digestion</b> of the pancreas. People with diabetes mellitus may have increased lysosomal activity and the degradation of some proteins can increase significantly. Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may involve the release of lysosomal enzymes into extracellular space that break down surrounding tissues. Abnormal proteolysis and generation of peptides that aggregate in cells and their ineffective removal may result in many age-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's.|$|E
50|$|The {{esophagus}} and dorsal {{stomach is}} made of stratified squamous epithelium, which is only weakly protected {{from the effects of}} hydrochloric acid, and those cells deeper in the layer of tissue transport hydrogen ions intracellularly, leading to death. This region is therefore especially vulnerable, and accounts for 80% of all gastric ulcers. The glandular portion produces hydrochloric acid and enzymes such as pepsinogen, as well as bicarbonate and mucus that helps prevent <b>self-digestion.</b> Mucosal blood flow is also an important factor in glandular epithelium health, since it provides oxygen and nutrients to the cells and helps to remove excess hydrogen ions.|$|E
50|$|Autolytic cell {{destruction}} is uncommon in living adult organisms and usually occurs in injured cells and dying tissue. Autolysis is {{initiated by the}} cells' lysosomes releasing digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm. These enzymes are released due to the cessation of active processes in the cell, not as an active process. In other words, though autolysis resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells, the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed and as the synonym <b>self-digestion</b> of autolysis seems to imply. Autolysis of individual cell organelles can be lessened if the organelle is stored in ice-cold isotonic buffer after cell fractionation.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{inappropriate}} or premature activation of the digestive enzymes (they may, for example, trigger pancreatic <b>self-digestion</b> causing pancreatitis), these enzymes are secreted as inactive zymogen. The precursor of pepsin, pepsinogen, is secreted by the stomach, and is activated only in the acidic environment found in stomach. The pancreas secretes the precursors {{of a number of}} proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The zymogen of trypsin is trypsinogen, which is activated by a very specific protease, enterokinase, secreted by the mucosa of the duodenum. The trypsin, once activated, can also cleave other trypsinogens as well as the precursors of other proteases such as chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase to activate them.|$|E
50|$|Trypsin is produced, {{stored and}} {{released}} as the inactive trypsinogen {{to ensure that}} the protein is only activated in the appropriate location. Premature trypsin activation can be destructive and may trigger a series of events that lead to pancreatic <b>self-digestion.</b> In normal pancreas, around 5% of trypsinogens are thought to get activated, therefore {{there are a number of}} defenses against such inappropriate activation. Trypsinogen is stored in intracellular vesicles in the pancreas called zymogen granules whose membranous walls are thought to be resistant to enzymatic degradation. A further safeguard against inappropriate trypsin activation is the presence of inhibitors such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1), which binds to any trypsin formed. Trypsin autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen is also a slow process due to the presence of a large negative charge on the conserved N-terminal hexapeptide of trypsinogen, which repels the aspartate on the back of trypsin's specificity pocket. Trypsin may also inactivate other trypsin by cleavage.|$|E

40|$|In the {{described}} trials {{the influence}} of biodynamic preparations and also of different kinds and intensities of fertilization on potatoes were investigated. It was observed that: — an increase of fertilizer enlarged the total yield, the average tuber weight, the total carbohydrate content, the weight loss in store and the tendency to <b>self-digestion,</b> — the higher intensity of fertilization also reduced the tissue strength, the content of dry matter and the share of saccharose. — In comparison to biodynamic and organic fertilizer the mineral fertilizer reduced the content of dry matter and increased the total yield, the average tuber weight, the <b>self-digestion,</b> conductivity and the tendency to build germs. — Biodynamic preparations influenced the number of flowers {{and the content of}} carbohydrates without a clear tendency, reduced the relation between leaf-surface and -dimensions and raised the tissue strength.

A lot more parameters are still waiting to be analyzed, for example some more contents like ascorbic acid, nitrate and minerals. In addition to that sensoric investigations are carried out in cooperation with the „Federal Research Institute for Nutrition“ in Karlsruhe. With these results and those of the following years we expect conclusive indications to possibilities of improving quality of potatoes by means of fertilization and treatment with biodynamic preparations. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} metastasize, tumor cells must adapt to untoward, {{stressful}} microenvironments as they disseminate into the systemic circulation and colonize distant organ sites. Autophagy, a tightly regulated lysosomal <b>self-digestion</b> {{process that is}} upregulated during cellular stress, has been demonstrated to suppress primary tumor formation, but how autophagy influences metastasis remains unknown. Autophagy may inhibit metastasis by promoting anti-tumor inflammatory responses or by restricting the expansion of dormant tumor cells into macrometastases. Conversely, self-eating may promote metastasis by enhancing tumor cell fitness in response to environmental stresses, such as anoikis, during metastatic progression. Because autophagy is titratable, it may serve both pro- and anti-metastatic functions depending on the contextual demands placed on tumor cells throughout the metastatic process...|$|E
40|$|AS {{part of the}} {{continuous}} search for the mechanismbehind the beneficial effect of caloric restriction (CR) in aging, the effect of CR on protein degradation is now being revised {{in light of the}} growing interest in intracellular clearance mechanisms. Two major proteolytic systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosomes, are responsible for the bulk of intracellular degradation (1, 2). The contribution of the lysosomal system to the degradation of intracellular com-ponents, by what is known as ‘‘autophagy’ ’ (or cellular <b>self-digestion),</b> has been known for more than 50 years (3).

40|$|Autophagy is a <b>self-digestion</b> {{process in}} which {{intracellular}} structures are degraded in response to stress. Notably, prolonged autophagy leads to cell death. In this study, we investigated whether CX- 4945, an orally available protein kinase 2 (CK 2) inhibitor, induces autophagic cell death in human cervical cancer-derived HeLa cells and in human prostate cancer-derived LNCaP cells. CX- 4945 treatment of both cell lines resulted {{in the formation of}} autophagosomes, in the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC 3), and in down-regulation of the Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) -p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (S 6 K) signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of CK 2 by CX- 4945 induced autophagic cell death in human cancer cells by down-regulating Akt-mTOR-S 6 K. These results suggest that autophagy-inducing agents have potential as anti-cancer drugs...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{measuring}} protein breakdown resulting from <b>self-digestion</b> during incubation in extracts of soybean leaves were examined. The release of free α-amino-nitrogen {{was measured with}} ninhydrin, and {{the disappearance of the}} large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPcase) was followed with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rates of protein breakdown were measured as a function of temperature, pH, and leaf developmental stage and in the presence of various proteinase inhibitors. These treatments had differential effects on apparent proteolysis, depending on the method used. Determination of the ratio of α-amino-nitrogen plus peptide bond-nitrogen to α-amino-nitrogen indicated that the ninhydrin method detected the activity of exopeptidases preferentially. The disappearance of the large subunit of RuBPCase as shown on gels was due primarily to the activity of endopeptidases. The sensitivity of the two types of proteolytic degradation to proteinase inhibitors differed...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy is a catabolic process {{involving}} <b>self-digestion</b> {{of cellular}} organelles during starvation {{as a means}} of cell survival; however, if it proceeds to completion, autophagy can lead to cell death. Autophagy is also a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor mechanism for mammary tumorigenesis, as the essential autophagy regulator beclin 1 is monoallelically deleted in breast carcinomas. However, the mechanism by which autophagy suppresses breast cancer remains elusive. Here we show that allelic loss of beclin 1 and defective autophagy sensitized mammary epithelial cells to metabolic stress and accelerated lumen formation in mammary acini. Autophagy defects also activated the DNA damage response in vitro and in mammary tumors in vivo, promoted gene amplification, and synergized with defective apoptosis to promote mammary tumorigenesis. Therefore, we propose that autophagy limits metabolic stress to protect the genome, and that defective autophagy increases DNA damage and genomic instability that ultimately facilitate breast cancer progression...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAutophagy is {{a process}} of {{cellular}} <b>self-digestion</b> induced by various forms of starvation. Although nitrogen deficit is a common trigger, some yeast cells induce autophagy upon switch from a rich to minimal media without nitrogen starvation. We show that the amino acid methionine is sufficient to inhibit such non-nitrogen-starvation (NNS) -induced autophagy. Methionine boosts synthesis of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM inhibits autophagy and promotes growth through the action of the methyltransferase Ppm 1 p, which modifies the catalytic subunit of PP 2 A in tune with SAM levels. Methylated PP 2 A promotes dephosphorylation of Npr 2 p, a component of a conserved complex that regulates NNS autophagy and other growth-related processes. Thus, methionine and SAM levels represent a critical gauge of amino acid availability that is sensed via the methylation of PP 2 A to reciprocally regulate cell growth and autophagy...|$|E
30|$|The {{inoculum}} {{size of the}} bacterium, {{measured as}} optical density, affected laccase production. The oxidative catalytic properties of laccase are known to help in <b>self-digestion</b> process of cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The enzyme profile of the bacterium under study was observed to be greatly affected by the final population size and accumulation of end products in the culture medium. Smaller inoculum size (0.125 - 0.500 %) was required for higher enzyme activity in exponential as well as stationary phase. Inoculum size beyond 1 % although triggered the enzyme production in stationary phase, it was not sustained at the later stage, i.e., stationary phase. The increase in inoculum size beyond the optimum level is {{likely to result in}} rapid depletion of indispensible nutrients. It subsequently may also contribute towards the accumulation of toxic metabolic substances in the growth medium. Similar observations on inoculum size of the bacterium with respect to their metabolic activities have been reported in earlier study (Darah et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) {{is a major}} {{integrator}} of {{the nutritional}} status {{at the crossroads of}} fat, sugar, and protein catabolism. Here we show that nutrient starvation causes rapid depletion of AcCoA. AcCoA depletion entailed the commensurate reduction in the overall acetylation of cytoplasmic proteins, as well as the induction of autophagy, a homeostatic process of <b>self-digestion.</b> Multiple distinct manipulations designed to increase or reduce cytosolic AcCoA led to the suppression or induction of autophagy, respectively, both in cultured human cells and in mice. Moreover, maintenance of high AcCoA levels inhibited maladaptive autophagy in a model of cardiac pressure overload. Depletion of AcCoA reduced the activity of the acetyltransferase EP 300, and EP 300 was required for the suppression of autophagy by high AcCoA levels. Altogether, our results indicate that cytosolic AcCoA functions as a central metabolic regulator of autophagy, thus delineating AcCoA-centered pharmacological strategies that allow for the therapeutic manipulation of autophagy...|$|E
