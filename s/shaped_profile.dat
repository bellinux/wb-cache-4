40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} soft contact lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design on the apparent epithelial thickness and indentation of the ocular surface with lens movement. Methods. Four soft contact lens designs comprising of two different plano midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profiles</b> and two edge designs (chiseled and knife edge) of silicone-hydrogel material were examined in 26 subjects aged 24. 7 ± 4. 6 years, each worn bilaterally in randomized order. Lens movement was imaged enface on insertion, at 2 and 4 hours with a high-speed, high-resolution camera simultaneous to the cross-section of {{the edge of the}} contact lens interaction with the ocular surface captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) nasally, temporally, and inferiorly. Optical imaging distortions were individually corrected for by imaging the apparent distortion of a glass slide surface by the removed lens. Results. Apparent epithelial thickness varied with edge position (P < 0. 001). When distortion was corrected for, epithelial indentation decreased with time after insertion (P = 0. 010), changed after a blink (P < 0. 001), and varied with position on the lens edge (P < 0. 001), with the latter being affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design. Horizontal and vertical lens movement did not change with time postinsertion. Vertical motion was affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> (P < 0. 001) and edge design (P < 0. 001). Lens movement was associated with physiologic epithelium thickness for lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge designs. Conclusions. Dynamic OCT coupled with high-resolution video demonstrated that soft contact lens movement and image-corrected ocular surface indentation were influenced by both lens edge design and midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Barling NB-3 was {{designed}} by Walter Barling in 1927. The aircraft was advertised as being able to right itself from any position with hands off the controls and also as being spin-proof. The NB-3 is a low wing tandem-seat, open cockpit aircraft with conventional landing gear. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering. The wings used a unique double layered corrogated aluminum skin with a smooth exterior that required custom presses to handle the various thicknesses of material along the span. The center section was straight with dihedreal in the outer bays. The spar was also aluminum with a U <b>shaped</b> <b>profile.</b> The aircraft was powered by an Anzani 3 cylinder radial engine, Superior radial or LeBlond 60-5-D. The main gear used long struts attached to the upper fuselage for the largest landing gear geometry. The NB-3 fuselage was widened, giving one cockpit a side-by side seating arrangement to accommodate 3 people. The new aircraft was named the NB-4.|$|E
