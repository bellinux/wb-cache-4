5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease. Most highly <b>susceptible</b> <b>species</b> quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|The {{impact of}} M. cerebralis in Europe is {{somewhat}} lessened because {{the species is}} endemic to this region, giving native fish stocks a degree of immunity. Rainbow trout, the most <b>susceptible</b> <b>species</b> to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing feral populations are rare, so few wild rainbow trout are {{young enough to be}} susceptible to infection. [...] On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking sport-fishing waters and for aquaculture, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the [...] "ossification" [...] stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges. Fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.|$|E

40|$|The `independent action hypothesis¿ (IAH) {{states that}} each {{pathogen}} individual has a non-zero probability of causing host death and that pathogen individuals act independently. IAH {{has not been}} rigorously tested. In this paper, we (i) develop a probabilistic framework for testing IAH and (ii) demonstrate that, in two out of the six virus¿insect pathosystems tested, IAH {{is supported by the}} data. We first show that IAH inextricably links host survivorship to the number of infecting pathogen individuals, and develop a model to predict the frequency of single- and dual-genotype infections when a host is challenged with a mixture of two genotypes. Model predictions were tested using genetically marked, near-identical baculovirus genotypes, and insect larvae from three host species differing in susceptibility. Observations in early-instar larvae of two <b>susceptible</b> host <b>species</b> support IAH, but observations in late-instar larvae of <b>susceptible</b> host <b>species</b> and larvae of a less <b>susceptible</b> host <b>species</b> were not in agreement with IAH. Hence the model is experimentally supported only in pathosystems in which the host is highly susceptible. We provide, to our knowledge, the first qualitative experimental evidence that, in such pathosystems, the action of a single virion is sufficient to cause diseas...|$|R
