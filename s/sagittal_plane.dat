25|$|The {{direction}} of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation. For this purpose, the acetabular inclination and the acetabular anteversion are mesurements of cup angulation in the coronal plane and the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> is {{the plane}} that divides the body or an organ {{vertically}} into right and left sides. If this vertical plane runs directly {{down the middle of}} the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a parasagittal plane, or less commonly a longitudinal section.|$|E
25|$|Scoliosis {{is defined}} as a {{three-dimensional}} deviation in the axis of a person's spine In the diagnostic sense, it {{is defined as}} a spinal curvature of more than 10 degrees to the right or left as the examiner faces the person, i.e. in the coronal plane. Deformity may also exist to the front or back as the examiner looks at the person from the side, i.e. in the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A longitudinal plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} affects {{all major}} structures within the thorax and abdomen. Generally, the organs are simply transposed through the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane.</b> The heart {{is located on}} the right side of the thorax, the stomach and spleen {{on the right side of}} the abdomen and the liver and gall bladder on the left side. The heart's normal right atrium occurs on the left, and the left atrium is on the right. The lung anatomy is reversed and the left lung has three lobes while the right lung has two lobes. The intestines and other internal structures are also reversed from the normal, and the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics are also transposed.|$|E
500|$|The {{shell of}} a bivalve is {{composed}} of calcium carbonate, and consists of two, usually similar, parts called valves. These are joined together along one edge (the hinge line) by a flexible ligament that, usually in conjunction with interlocking [...] "teeth" [...] {{on each of the}} valves, forms the hinge. This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves detaching. The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with the hinge lying in the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane.</b> Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length, but the majority of species do not exceed 10cm (4in).|$|E
30|$|Deformities in coronal and <b>sagittal</b> <b>planes</b> {{should be}} {{considered}} separately. In varus or valgus deformity, the blocking screws should be inserted in the anteroposterior plane in each fragment. Similarly, in procurvatum or recurvatum deformity, the blocking screws should be inserted in the mediolateral plane in each fragment. If the deformity is in oblique plane, it could be stabilized by blocking screws placed perpendicular to the plane of maximum deformity or blocking screws placed in both coronal and <b>sagittal</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
30|$|Reconstructed {{images in}} the axial and <b>sagittal</b> <b>planes</b> were {{obtained}} at the scanner. The slice thickness in the axial, coronal and <b>sagittal</b> <b>planes</b> was 2.5, 3 and 3  mm, respectively. In all subjects, axial thin-slice source images were recalled from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and loaded onto a commercial workstation (General Electric Medical Systems, Centricity Radiology, RA 600 v 8.0). In some patients, new reconstructions were created at another work station (General Electric Advantage Workstation 4.2. 4, LightSpeed Pro, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using the thin axial slices.|$|R

2500|$|Functional {{classification}} {{testing was}} developed in 1989 for Nordic sit skiing, with the same system still being used for the 1998 Winter Paralympics. [...] The tests included hand, arm and shoulder coordination, a sitting balance in the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> test, a stability <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> test, a sitting balance test in the frontal planes, and a functional sitting ability test of the frontal and sagittal planes with an examination of sideways displacement.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> is a plane {{parallel}} to the sagittal suture. All other sagittal planes (referred to as parasagittal planes) are {{parallel to}} it. It {{is also known as}} a [...] "longitudinal plane". The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The {{muscles and}} joints of the {{shoulder}} allow it to move through a remarkable range of motion, {{making it one of}} the most mobile joints in the human body. [...] The shoulder can abduct, adduct, rotate, be raised in front of and behind the torso and move through a full 360° in the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane.</b> [...] This tremendous range of motion also makes the shoulder extremely unstable, far more prone to dislocation and injury than other joints ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{accurately}} {{evaluate the}} echogenicity of an ultrasound, {{one has to}} take into account the physical laws of reflection, absorption and dispersion. It is at all times important to acknowledge that the structures in the joint of the shoulder are not aligned in the transversal, coronal or <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane,</b> and that therefore during imaging of the shoulder the transducer head has to be held [...] perpendicularly or parallel to the structures of interest. Otherwise the appearing echogenicity may not be evaluated.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{coordinate}} system frequently used {{relates to the}} plane of incidence. This is the plane made by the incoming propagation direction and the vector perpendicular to the plane of an interface, in other words, the plane in which the ray travels before and after reflection or refraction. [...] The component of the electric field parallel to this plane is termed p-like (parallel) and the component perpendicular to this plane is termed s-like (from senkrecht, German for perpendicular). Polarized light with its electric field along the plane of incidence is thus denoted p-polarized, while light whose electric field is normal to the plane of incidence is called s-polarized. P polarization is {{commonly referred to as}} transverse-magnetic (TM), and has also been termed pi-polarized or tangential plane polarized. S polarization is also called transverse-electric (TE), as well as sigma-polarized or <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> polarized.|$|E
5000|$|The term parasagittal {{is used to}} {{describe}} any plane parallel to the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane.</b> In practice, such a section {{is often referred to}} simply as a [...] "sagittal" [...] view because viewing is achieved along the sagittal axis (see below). Owing to the specific nature of its definition, only one true <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane</b> exists, and it corresponds to the [...] "mid-sagittal" [...] view. Be aware that the term [...] "sagittal view" [...] may be applied to any parasagittal section as well as the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane,</b> as the parasagittal and sagittal axes are identical (parallel to the <b>sagittal</b> <b>plane).</b> Specific named parasagittal planes include: ...|$|E
