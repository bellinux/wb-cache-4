50|$|Ancient {{and medieval}} {{elevators}} used drive systems based on hoists or winders. The invention {{of a system}} based on the <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> {{was perhaps the most}} important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> elevator was built by Ivan Kulibin and installed in Winter Palace in 1793. Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in Arkhangelskoye near Moscow.|$|E

50|$|The Pentalobe {{security}} screw (Apple nomenclature), or pentalobe <b>screw</b> <b>drive,</b> is a five-pointed tamper-resistant system primarily used by Apple in its products. Pentalobe screws {{have been}} used by Apple since 2009, when they were first implemented in the 15-inch MacBook Pro. They have since been used on other MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and iPhone models. Apple attracted criticism upon the introduction of the pentalobe screw; it was seen as an attempt to lock individuals out of their devices.|$|E
50|$|The British Ice Challenger {{exploration}} team used a <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> in their Snowbird 6 vehicle (a modified Bombardier tracked craft) to traverse the ice floes in the Bering Strait. The rotating cylinders allowed Snowbird 6 to move over ice and to propel itself through water, but the screw system {{was not considered}} suitable for long distances, and the cylinders could be raised so that the vehicle could also run on conventional caterpillar tracks. The Ice Challenger website says that the design {{was inspired by a}} Russian vehicle used to pick up cosmonauts who landed in Siberia (perhaps the ZIL-2906).|$|E

50|$|Modern screws {{employ a}} wide variety of drive designs, each {{requiring}} a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.|$|E
50|$|A pivot saw has {{the highest}} degree of stiffness, because the forces are {{arranged}} in a closed loop (fig.1). If {{we assume that the}} base of such a saw is very rigid, the force will flow from the pivot of the gearbox to the ball screw feed system in a closed loop, whereby the cutting force engages in the middle, approximately, between rotation point and ball screw. This arrangement substantially reduces the lost motion and compliance in the feed system. Furthermore, the ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> which forces the blade into the cut is bolted to the fixture frame which again is clamped to the billet and gives this arrangement additional rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The {{extruder}} machine {{consists of a}} screw and barrel, <b>screw</b> <b>drive,</b> heaters, and a die. The extruder applies two conditions pressure. The extruder screw also provides for additional mixing of the compound through the shearing action of the screw. The compound is pushed through a die, after which the extruded profile is vulcanized in a continuous oven, cooled to terminate the vulcanization process, and either rolled up on a spool or cut to length. Tire treads are often extruded with four components in a quadraplex extruder, one with four screws processing four different compounds, usually a base compound, core compound, tread compound, and wing compound. Extrusion is also used for sidewall profiles and inner liners.|$|E
5000|$|After Asturias {{another four}} [...] "A-series" [...] liners were built to a revised and {{enlarged}} design, with three screws instead of two. Each {{of the two}} outer <b>screws</b> was <b>driven</b> by a four-cylinder triple-expansion engine. The middle <b>screw</b> was <b>driven</b> by a low-pressure steam turbine, driven by exhaust steam from the low-pressure cylinders of the two reciprocating engines.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to reset a preload loss in ball <b>screw</b> <b>drives</b> which enables to compensate losses of positioning accuracy due to wear over lifetime. The main purposes are reduced maintenance, longer service life and improved workpiece quality by regenerating the desired preload conditions {{which leads to a}} higher profit for manufacturers. For this purpose, a novel shape memory alloy (SMA) bulk actuator module for ball <b>screw</b> <b>drives</b> is designed. The device is developed to be implemented in standard drives without major changes in component design. It is installed between flanged nut and counter nut and replaces a spacer usually needed to set a defined preload. To achieve the required actuator performance SMA bulk actuators are investigated in detail. This covers their basic design and activation concepts. A prototype is designed and experimentally investigated; measurements show the proof of the concept...|$|R

5000|$|The DA lenses were {{designed}} specifically for the Pentax digital cameras incorporating an APS-C digital sensor. As the APS-C sensor has a smaller surface area than 35mm film, these lenses are not {{generally considered to be}} compatible with older cameras. They also lack an aperture ring, limiting their use on cameras that do not support automatic aperture settings. Most of the DA zoom lenses are available in weather resistant (WR) versions to match the weather sealed capabilities of the medium to upper level Pentax DSLR camera bodies. While older models still have the in-body <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> autofocus system, newer designs marked [...] "DC", [...] "SDM" [...] or [...] "PLM" [...] feature silent, in-lens autofocus motors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{throttle}} {{was controlled}} by a bi-directional <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> electric motor, the two connected during use by an electro magnet. A 12v post would stay nearly centered between two throttle mounted electric contacts, one for turning the motor's screw for more throttle, the other for less. The floating post would [...] "guide" [...] the motor (and throttle and vehicle speed) with input from 1) sprung leveraged spinning weights driven from the transmission's speedometer cable, and 2) a counter-spring tension set by a cable from a dial near the steering wheel. This first-mass-marketed design was the industry standard for just over a decade (GM changed to vacuum-actuator/turn-signal-engage-button in 1969, though still a [...] "Speedostat" [...] product).|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} screws and other {{hardware}} for internal fixation {{within the body}} is huge and diverse. Like prosthetics, it integrates the industrial and medicosurgical fields, causing manufacturing technologies (such as machining, CAD/CAM, and 3D printing) to intersect with the art and science of medicine. Like aerospace and nuclear power, this field involves {{some of the highest}} technology for fasteners, {{as well as some of}} the highest prices, for the simple reason that performance, longevity, and quality have to be excellent in such applications. Bone screws tend to be made of stainless steel or titanium, and they often have high-end features such as conical threads, multistart threads, cannulation (hollow core), and proprietary <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> types (some not seen outside of these applications).|$|E

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of parity non-conservation (see History), it was found that, in beta decay, electrons are emitted mostly with negative helicity, i.e., they move, naively speaking, like left-handed <b>screws</b> <b>driven</b> into a material (they have negative longitudinal polarization). Conversely, positrons have mostly positive helicity, i.e., they move like right-handed screws. Neutrinos (emitted in positron decay) have positive helicity, while antineutrinos (emitted in electron decay) have negative helicity.|$|R
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex socket <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, deep sea {{technology}} has improved significantly: including widespread and low cost use of navigation technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Ultra-short baseline (USBL); survey technology such as Multibeam echosounder (MBES) and Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); and intervention technology including Remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) and high power Umbilical cables. There is also improved technology {{that could be}} used in mining including Pumps, tracked and <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> rovers, rigid and flexible Drilling risers, and Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene rope. Mining is considered to be similar to the potato harvest on land, which involves mining a field partitioned into long, narrow strips. The mining support vessel follows the mining route of the seafloor mining tools, picking up the about potato-sized nodules from the seafloor.|$|E
