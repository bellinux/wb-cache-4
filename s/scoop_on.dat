Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus disengages the anti-gravity device, sending the <b>Scoop</b> <b>on</b> a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo.

2500|$|P-40F and P-40L, {{which both}} {{featured}} Packard V-1650 Merlin engine {{in place of}} the normal Allison, and thus did not have the carburetor <b>scoop</b> <b>on</b> top of the nose.

The L in some cases also featured a fillet in front of the vertical stabilizer, or a stretched fuselage to compensate for the higher torque. The P-40L was sometimes nicknamed [...] "Gypsy Rose Lee", after a famous stripper of the era, due to its stripped-down condition. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces under the designation Kittyhawk Mk II, a total of 330 Mk IIs were supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease.

2500|$|Most recently, Van Halen has {{collaborated with}} Fender guitars {{to produce a}} replica of the Frankenstrat. Van Halen and Chip Ellis of the Fender Custom Shop teamed up to produce a guitar priced at $25,000 each. Van Halen has also collaborated with Fender to launch his own EVH brand of guitars, amps, and musical {{instrument}} equipment, starting with his new EVH Brand 5150 III amplifier. [...] Van Halen now uses prototypes of his new EVH Brand Wolfgang, an updated version of Van Halen's Peavey Wolfgangs, but with new pickups, knobs, and a thinner but very elaborate quilted maple top to allow the basswood to dominate the tone, providing more tonal resonance but with a balanced high sustain. [...] The new Wolfgang is also equipped with an original Floyd Rose and a slightly altered headstock. [...] This was Ed and Hartley Peavey's original design for the headstock, which Van Halen had patented without the <b>scoop</b> <b>on</b> {{the final version of the}} Peavey Wolfgang. [...] He has been seen with three new Wolfgang guitars: [...] a sunburst, a black one, and a white one (the best sounding out of the three prototypes, according to Eddie).|$|E
2500|$|As {{originally}} {{specified by}} Kelsey and Saville, the XP-39 had a turbo-supercharger to augment its high-altitude performance. Bell cooled the turbo with a <b>scoop</b> <b>on</b> {{the left side}} of the fuselage. Kelsey wished to shepherd the XP-39 through its early engineering teething troubles, but he was ordered to England. The XP-39 project was handed over to others, and in June 1939 the prototype was ordered by General Henry H. Arnold to be evaluated in NACA wind tunnels to find ways of increasing its speed, by reducing parasitic drag. Tests were carried out, and Bell engineers followed the recommendations of NACA and the Army to reduce drag such that the top speed was increased 16%. NACA wrote, [...] "it is imperative to enclose the supercharger within the airplane with an efficient duct system for cooling the rotor and discharging the cooling air and exhaust gases." [...] In the very tightly planned XP-39, though, there was no internal space left over for the turbo. Using a drag-buildup scheme, a number of potential areas of drag reduction were found. NACA concluded that a top speed of 429mph could be realized with the aerodynamic improvements they had developed and an uprated V-1710 with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger.|$|E
2500|$|The Z06 {{arrived as}} a 2006 {{model in the}} third quarter of 2005 and is the lightest of all Corvette models. The Z06 was {{equipped}} with the largest-displacement small-block ever produced, a new 7.0 L (427 cu in) engine codenamed LS7. The LS7 produced 505hp (376kW) and is the most powerful naturally aspirated engine put into a production car from General Motors. In addition to the larger displacement engine, the Corvette Z06 has a dry sump oiling system, and connecting rods made out of titanium alloy. The frame of the Z06 is constructed from aluminum, saving 136 pounds (61 kg) over the standard steel frame. Other weight saving measures such as balsa wood/carbon fiber composite floors and a magnesium alloy engine cradle were used. The Z06's body differentiates itself from the standard Corvette with its larger front and rear fenders and an intake inlet <b>scoop</b> <b>on</b> the front bumper. The front fenders are constructed with carbon fiber and the rear fenders contain ducts to aid in cooling the rear brakes. The Z06 weighed , giving it a weight to power ratio of , allowing it to achieve a fuel economy of [...] in the city and [...] on the highway. The Z06 was the official pace car for both the 2006 Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 race. Car and Driver recorded a 0-60mph time of 3.6 seconds and 1/4 mile in 11.7 seconds at 125mph in October 2005. A pre-production/pre-official model was recorded by AMS against the 483bhp Porsche 996 GT2 with a slower 0-60 time of 4.3 seconds and a 0-to-400-meter time of 12.7 seconds in May 2004.The Z06 contains the following enhancements over the standard C6 Corvette: ...|$|E
