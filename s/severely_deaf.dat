5000|$|The term hearing {{or hearing}} person, from the {{perspective}} of mainstream English-language culture, refers to someone whose sense of hearing is at the medical norm. From this point of view, someone who is not fully hearing has a hearing loss or is said to be hard of hearing or deaf. The continuum of hearing ability tends to be broken down into fine gradations. Moving down the scale and further away from the medical norm, people are classed as hearing, then slightly hard of hearing, moderately hard of hearing, severely hard of hearing, and finally deaf (<b>severely</b> <b>deaf</b> or profoundly deaf for those furthest from the norm).|$|E

This work proposes two {{models for the}} optimization of electrodes array stimulation in cochlear implants. The first model was developed according to wave propagation theory applied to the cochlea. The second one consisted on data processing using a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) in order to remedy to the first model limitations. The models were tested with an acoustic signal, which frequency belongs to the human hearing frequency range. Frequency and transient representations of the reconstructed signals were compared, emphasizing the better linearity of the STFT model.

A comparison of the change in steadiness scores between the control and experimental groups revealed no significant difference in static balance ability as measured by degree of sway.

40|$|While studies about {{minority}} group prisoners {{are becoming more}} commonplace in prison research, knowledge about the experiences of hard of hearing (HoH) and d/Deaf prisoners remains limited. A primary aim of this thesis {{is to provide a}} more comprehensive understanding about the lives of HoH/d/Deaf people in prisons throughout England and Wales than what is already available, and to explore existing claims that d/Deaf prisoners suffer disproportionately whilst in custody. In order to do this a qualitative methodology is adopted, with semi-structured interviews being carried out with HoH, <b>severely</b> <b>deaf</b> and profoundly Deaf prisoners, and staff members across seven prisons in England, and observations being made at each establishment. This thesis shows that in an environment like prison, those who are seen as ‘different’ often become institutionally deficient. While this could apply to many different subsections of prison populations, findings presented throughout show that the difference of d/Deafness is unique because sound rules in prison, with penal regimes being reliant on sound in order to run. However, d/Deafness, it is shown, is not merely a lack of hearing, and on the contrary there are different levels and layers of d/Deafness. Consequently, how a d/Deaf person experiences prison depends strongly on {{the way in which they}} identify with their d/Deafness and the way their d/Deafness is viewed by the prison. Despite such differences, findings suggest that there is little room for either deafness or Deafness in prison, with HoH/deaf and particularly Deaf prisoners often experiencing the pains of imprisonment more severely than their hearing peers as a result the Prison Service's inability to accommodate such difference. This thesis makes an original and significant contribution to existing knowledge for a myriad of reasons. Firstly, it fuses together the fields of Deaf Studies and prison studies in a way that has not been done before, and considers d/Deafness on both an audiological and cultural level. In doing this, it notes the similarities and differences between the experiences of those who are HoH, those who are <b>severely</b> <b>deaf,</b> and those who are culturally and linguistically Deaf; giving meaningful consideration to the role of imported identity in prison. Secondly, excluding small-scale unpublished undergraduate dissertations, it is the first empirical study about d/Deaf prisoners in England and Wales to carry out face-to-face interviews with these prisoners. Finally, as the most in-depth research yet to be carried out about HoH/d/Deaf prisoners in England and Wales, this thesis provides a level of insight which has not been available previously...|$|E

We first analysed the spatio-temporal pattern of Elp 3 mRNA expression and showed that it was expressed in the entire early otocyst at E 11. 5 and persisted later in the sensory epithelium of the cochlea, in the spiral ganglion and in the vestibule. To unravel functions of Elp 3, we used conditional knock-out mice in which Elp 3 gene is deleted from early otocyst (Elp 3 cKO). We submitted these mice to a battery of vestibular testing and found significant abnormalities. Besides, the auditory brain stem response of Elp 3 cKO indicated that these mice are <b>severely</b> <b>deaf.</b> We were also able to demonstrate an increased level of apoptosis in the Elp 3 cKO spiral ganglion leading to a reduced number of neurons and fibers innervating the sensory cells as well as a reduced number of their synaptic ribbons. Moreover, the remaining spiral ganglion neurons extend processes showing clearly defects regarding sensory cell innervation.

Mass spectrometry and immunoblotting were used to identify this antigen as the avian ortholog of the very large G-protein-coupled receptor VLGR 1, the product of the Usher syndrome USH 2 C (Mass 1) locus. Like ankle links, Vlgr 1 is expressed transiently around the base of developing hair bundles in mice. Ankle links fail to form in the cochleae of mice carrying a targeted mutation in Vlgr 1 (Vlgr 1 /del 7 TM), and the bundles become disorganized just after birth.

Moreover, scala tympani arrays typically do not extend to the apical turn of the cochlea in which low frequencies are represented. In the present study, we have tested in an animal model an alternative to the conventional cochlear implant: a multielectrode array implanted directly into the auditory nerve. We monitored the specificity of stimulation of the auditory pathway by recording extracellular unit activity at 32 sites along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus. The results demonstrate the activation of specific auditory nerve populations throughout essentially the entire frequency range that is represented by characteristic frequencies in the inferior colliculus. Compared to conventional scala tympani stimulation, thresholds for neural excitation are as much as 50 -fold lower and interference between electrodes stimulated simultaneously is markedly reduced. The results suggest that if an intraneural stimulating array were incorporated into an auditory prosthesis system for humans, it could offer substantial improvement in hearing replacement compared to contemporary cochlear implants...|$|E

Identifying vocal emotions (angry or sad?) was shown to be deprived; the categorization of the gender of a talker (a man or a woman?) was abnormal. All auditory signals used in daily life, causing problematic communication for CI users. Musicians {{have been shown to}} have benefits for auditory perception.

During 6 weeks CI users were musically trained, received music therapy or non-music related training. Effects of musical training on melody identification and of music therapy on emotion identification were shown. Subjectively, the CI users in the music therapy group felt themselves enjoying music more.

From animal models and human neuroimaging studies it has been proposed the integrative functions of auditory cortex are compromised by crossmodal plasticity.

Here we argue that ‘cochlear implant sensitive periods’ comprise both auditory and language sensitive periods, and thus cannot be fully described with animal models. Despite prevailing assumptions, {{there is no evidence to}} link the use of a visual language to poorer CI outcome. Crossmodal reorganisation of auditory cortex occurs regardless of compensatory strategies, such as sign language, used by the deaf person. In contrast, language deprivation during early sensitive periods has been repeatedly linked to poor language outcomes. Language sensitive periods have largely been ignored when considering variation in CI outcome, leading to ill-founded recommendations concerning visual language in CI habilitation...|$|R
