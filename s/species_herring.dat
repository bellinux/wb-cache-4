Pair-wise comparisons of trophic niche overlap showed that, in general, niche overlap between individuals of the same species was significantly higher than overlap between individuals from different species, suggesting that the available food resources were partitioned.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of year-class strength among stocks of abundant fish <b>species</b> (<b>herring,</b> cod, haddock, saithe, redfish and capelin) in the North Atlantic is given {{with a view}} to discussing whether covariation in year-class strength exists among species living in the same region and among stocks of the same species in different regions. It is suggested that fish stocks of the same species living in regions distinctly separated from each other are independent and apparently no covariation in year-class strength exists among them. Even in neighbouring regions no apparent covariation could be found. Not all the species living in the same region produce numerous broods in the same year. Indications were found that the total number of 0 -group fishes produced varied from year to year.

40|$|Since 1978 {{large numbers}} of harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) have invaded areas of North Norway in winter and spring.

Sampling of stomach contents for food analyses and of teeth for age determinations was carried out from harp seals taken as bycatch in Norwegian gill-net fisheries in 1986 and 1988. It appears that the seal herds comprised both immature and mature animals. The stomach analyses suggested that feeding was opportunistic, with a variety of fish (in particular the gadoid species cod, saithe, haddock and Norway pout, and the pelagic shoaling <b>species</b> <b>herring</b> and capelin) being taken as prey.

40|$|Echo {{integration}} is an established method for stock estimation. However, {{this method is}} not free of errors like every other measuring method. Especially the variation between day and night behaviour of fish may lead to large measuring errors. A new method is represented detecting such systematic errors, exemplified by investigations during the international hydroacoustic survey on the spring spawning herring in the Norwegian Sea. For this method all measured sA-values are sorted by starting time of the measuring unit distance. In order to reduce random influences a moving average over five time intervals is computed. When displaying these values in a diagram makes {{it is very easy}} to detect systematic errors based on the differences in day-night behaviour. For both <b>species,</b> <b>herring</b> and blue whiting, stock estimations are calculated based on the measured sA-values and the results of the analysed trawl catches. The influence of the differnt day and night behaviour of herring on the results of its biomass estimation is rather low.

The result of this investigation should initiate a change of the evaluation procedure for stock estimation based on hydroacoustic measurements...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 1980 s, {{reproductive}} {{success of the}} top-predator cod declined and stock sizes of the main prey <b>species</b> <b>herring</b> and especially sprat, important planktivorous predators in the system, increased substantially. Although the hydrographic conditions conducive for survival of early life stages improved during the 1990 s, recruitment success of cod remained far below average. As clupeids {{have been identified as}} major predators on cod eggs and larvae in the Baltic, increased predation may be an important factor hampering stock recovery. Results from stomach content analysis of herring and sprat during the spawning season of 1988 – 1995 and ichthyoplankton surveys in the Bornholm Basin (the only important spawning area of cod in the Central Baltic in this period) allow a comparison of estimated consumption rates by the predator populations with standing stocks and production rates of cod eggs and larvae. Despite uncertainties in the estimation procedure, the findings confirm substantial predation on cod eggs by both clupeid species. Especially {{at the beginning of the}} cod-spawning season, characterized by low zooplankton availability, sprat consumed a considerable proportion of the eggs produced. In 1993, the relative importance of zooplankton as prey increased, while fish eggs were encountered more rarely. In contrast, predation by herring remained on the same level or even increased, especially late in the spawning season. The larval stage of cod is not substantially affected by predation owing to limited spatial overlap between prey and predator...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how contaminant exposure and reduced food intake affect tissue distribution and biotransformation of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) in Arctic seabirds using herring gull (Larus argentatus) as a model <b>species.</b> <b>Herring</b> gull chicks were exposed for 44 d to cod liver oil containing a typical mixture of contaminants. Following exposure, food intake was reduced for a one-week period in a subgroup of the chicks. Polyclorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and brominated flame retardants, as well as a wide range of hydroxy, methyl sulfone, and methoxy compounds were measured in liver, brain, and plasma samples. Additionally, phase I biotransformation enzyme activities and phase I and II messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression were investigated in the liver, brain, or both. Both contaminant exposure and reduced food intake had an increasing effect on the concentrations of HOCs and their metabolites. The HOC exposure and reduced food intake also led to increased 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activity, whereas mRNA expression of the biotransformation enzymes increased only following the reduced food intake. Tissue distribution of HOCs and their metabolites was not affected by either contaminant exposure or reduced food intake. In conclusion, the results indicate that biotransformation capacity and formation of HOC metabolites increase during reduced food intake. This finding supports the hypothesis that reduced food intake increases the susceptibility of Arctic animals to the effects of lipophilic HOCs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013; 32 : 156164.

The historical development of this plankton community in the last 70 years is discussed. Spring and summer development of the plankton fauna was studiedin the Bothnian Bay. Compared to in southern parts of the Balticit could be shown that the start of development in spring formany species was only moderately later in the Bothnian Bay. Theperiod of maximal biomass was in late summer and autumn. In a study of horizontal distribution large between-station variations were found. These variations were not random as close stations formed homogenous groups. Several cases of patchiness were established. Systematically appearing differences in age-distributions were proposed {{as a factor in}} the formation of patchiness. The selective prédation on zooplankton by Baltic herring was studied in the Bothnian Bay. Besides chosing certain <b>species</b> <b>herring</b> selects the older and larger stages of these species. Egg-bearing Eurytemora females were more heavily preyed upon than the males. From literature information and own observations it was proposed that in sence of production the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea are two very different systems. Climatic effects cause a delay of primary production in spring enabling the pelagic consumers to develop in phase with the producers in the Bothnian Bay. Contrary to systems with a spring peak in phytoplankton growth this situation will lead to high pelagial efficiency leaving little to feed the benthic communities. digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|The Georges Bank {{ecosystem}} {{has undergone}} {{dramatic changes in}} biomass and species dominance under exploitation. Sharp declines in the biomass of both pelagic and demersal fish populations have occurred associated with rapid increases in fishing effort by distant water fleets. We corrected nominal effort series for changes in vessel size, gear type and country of origin {{in an attempt to}} provide a measure of the intensity of the perturbation resulting from large scale changes in exploitation patterns on Georges Bank. A fourfold increase was noted in standardized effort over the period 1960 – 72. Declines in catch-per-standard day fished, and relative biomass indices derived from research vessel surveys indicated marked decreases in all components of the system during the period 1960 – 76. Decreases in fishing effort were effected with the implementation of extended jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977; however, several major stocks had collapsed by that time. Fundamental changes were noted in the production levels on Georges Bank during the period 1960 – 76. Declines in overall production can be attributed largely to the collapse of the herring population by 1976 – 77 under heavy exploitation. Recent increases in biomass of elasmobranchs and principal pelagic <b>species</b> (<b>herring</b> and mackerel) have resulted in further shifts in system structure. The biomass of piscivores is currently high and this shift may act synergistically with increasing exploitation rates to cause further declines in biomass of commercially desirable species...|$|E
40|$|Summary 1. Retrospective {{determination}} of location for marine animals would facilitate investigations of migration, connectivity and food provenance. Predictable spatial variations in carbon and nitrogen isotopes in primary production across shelf seas {{provide a basis}} for stable isotope-based location. 2. Here, we assess the accuracy and precision that can be obtained through dietary-isotope-based location methods. We build isoscapes from jellyfish tissues and use these to assign scallops of fixed and known individual location, and herring with well-understood population-level distributions in the North Sea. 3. Accuracy and precision for retrospective isotope-based location in the North Sea were of a similar order to light-based location devices, with 75 % of individual scallops assigned correctly to areas representing c. 30 % of the North Sea, with a mean linear error on the order of 102 km. Applying assignment methods to an alternative migratory <b>species</b> (<b>herring)</b> resulted in ecologically realistic assignments consistent with fisheries survey data. 4. Location methods based on dietary isotopes such as carbon and nitrogen recover the spatial origin of nutrients assimilated into tissues, and this may not correspond directly to the physical location if either the test animal or its prey is highly migratory. Stable isotope-based location can be applied to any marine-feeding organism or derived food product, but the ecological meaning of any assigned area will be more difficult to interpret for large, high trophic level, migratory animals with relatively slow isotopic assimilation rates...|$|E
40|$|The Scenario C project aims at {{a dynamic}} minimal {{realistic}} model for capelin, herring, cod, harp seals and minke whales in the Barents Sea and for herring in the Norwegian Sea. This report {{is an attempt}} to estimate a consumption function for cod from estimated monthly abundances of capelin, herring and younger cod in regions of the Barents Sea, and the observed stomach contents of cods. The data are obtained from Institute of Marine Research. A discrete choice model for the diet choice and consumption function of cod in the Barents Sea is implemented using the data of cod and three main prey <b>species</b> (<b>herring,</b> capelin, cod) from 1992 - 2000. It uses the notion of choice probability to describe the foraging behavior. In particular, it estimates how prey selection varies with respect to environmental changes. By using diet choice model, prey consumption can be easily computed and predicted from environmental variables. In conclusion, the empirical results are quite consistent with the hypothesis that prey selection probability is highly related to the biomass amount of the specific prey. Particularly when the biomass is at low levels, even a small increase will lead to a large probability change, with the more available biomass, the smaller the growth. At high levels, the probability is nearly linear in biomasses. As a whole, the probability change is modeled to have a logistic pattern. In addition, it shows that cod prefers capelin, rather than young cod and herring. Emneord/Keywords: Scenario, cod, predation, multinomial logit model...|$|E

40|$|Fishes {{living in}} icy {{seawater}} are usually protected from freezing by endogenous antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to ice crystals and {{stop them from}} growing. The scattered distribution of five highly diverse AFP types across phylogenetically disparate fish species is puzzling. The appearance of radically different AFPs in closely related species {{has been attributed to}} the rapid, independent evolution of these proteins in response to natural selection caused by sea level glaciations within the last 20 million years. In at least one instance the same type of simple repetitive AFP has independently originated in two distant species by convergent evolution. But, the isolated occurrence of three very similar type II AFPs in three distantly related <b>species</b> (<b>herring,</b> smelt and sea raven) cannot be explained by this mechanism. These globular, lectin-like AFPs have a unique disulfide-bonding pattern, and share up to 85 % identity in their amino acid sequences, with regions of even higher identity in their genes. A thorough search of current databases failed to find a homolog in any other species with greater than 40 % amino acid sequence identity. Consistent with this result, genomic Southern blots showed the lectin-like AFP gene was absent from all other fish species tested. The remarkable conservation of both intron and exon sequences, the lack of correlation between evolutionary distance and mutation rate, and the pattern of silent vs non-silent codon changes make it unlikely that the gene for this AFP pre-existed but was lost from most branches of the teleost radiation. We propose instead that lateral gene transfer has resulted in the occurrence of the type II AFPs in herring, smelt and sea raven an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Based on {{extensive}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data, we previously {{showed that}} the model of speciation among species of herring gull (Larus argentatus) complex was not that of a ring species, but most likely due more complex speciation scenario's. We also found that two <b>species,</b> <b>herring</b> gull and glaucous gull (L. hyperboreus) displayed an unexpected biphyletic distribution of their mtDNA haplotypes. It was evident that mtDNA sequence data alone were far from sufficient to obtain a more accurate and detailed insight into the demographic processes that underlie speciation of this complex, and that extensive autosomal genetic analysis was warranted. Results For this reason, the present study focuses on {{the reconstruction of the}} phylogeographic history of a limited number of gull species by means of a combined approach of mtDNA sequence data and 230 autosomal amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. At the species level, the mtDNA and AFLP genetic data were largely congruent. Not only for argentatus and hyperboreus, but also among a third species, great black-backed gull (L. marinus) we observed two distinct groups of mtDNA sequence haplotypes. Based on the AFLP data we were also able to detect distinct genetic subgroups among the various argentatus, hyperboreus, and marinus populations, supporting our initial hypothesis that complex demographic scenario's underlie speciation in the herring gull complex. Conclusions We present evidence that for each of these three biphyletic gull species, extensive mtDNA introgression could have taken place among the various geographically distinct subpopulations, or even among current species. Moreover, based on a large number of autosomal AFLP loci, we found evidence for distinct and complex demographic scenario's {{for each of the three}} species we studied. A more refined insight into the exact phylogeographic history within the herring gull complex is still impossible, and requires detailed autosomal sequence information, a topic of our future studies. </p...|$|E
