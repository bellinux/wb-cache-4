40|$|Many {{proposed}} {{formation flying}} missions seek {{to advance the}} state of the art in spacecraft science imaging by utilizing precision dual spacecraft formation flying to enable a virtual space telescope. Using precision dual spacecraft alignment, very long focal lengths can be achieved by locating the optics on one spacecraft and the detector on the other. Proposed science missions include astrophysics concepts with spacecraft separations from 1000 km to 25, 000 km, such as the Milli-Arc-Second Structure Imager (MASSIM) and the New Worlds Observer, and Heliophysics concepts for solar coronagraphs and X-ray imaging with smaller separations (50 m 500 m). All of these proposed missions require advances in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) for precision formation flying. In particular, very precise astrometric alignment control and estimation is required for precise inertial pointing of the virtual space telescope to enable science imaging orders of magnitude better than can be achieved with conventional single spacecraft instruments. This work develops design architectures, algorithms, and performance analysis of proposed GNC systems for precision dual spacecraft astrometric alignment. These systems employ a variety of GNC sensors and actuators, including laser-based alignment and ranging systems, optical imaging sensors (e. g. guide <b>star</b> <b>telescope),</b> inertial measurement units (IMU), as well as micro-thruster and precision stabilized platforms. A comprehensive GNC performance analysis is given for Heliophysics dual spacecraft PFF imaging mission concept...|$|E

50|$|The Microvariability and Oscillations of <b>STars</b> <b>telescope,</b> {{better known}} simply as MOST, is Canada's first space telescope. Up until nearly 10 years after its launch {{it was also the}} {{smallest}} space telescope in orbit (for which its creators nicknamed it the “Humble Space Telescope”, in reference to one of the largest, the Hubble). MOST is the first spacecraft dedicated to the study of asteroseismology, subsequently followed by the now-completed COROT and Kepler missions.

500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of <b>STars</b> <b>telescope</b> initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet.

40|$|Proxima Centauri {{is known}} as the closest star from the Sun. Recently, radial {{velocity}} observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it. With an orbital period of 11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to search for its transit, using the Bright <b>Star</b> Survey <b>Telescope</b> at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8 th, is identified tentatively. Its midtime, T_C= 2, 457, 640. 1990 ± 0. 0017 HJD, is consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1 σ confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence level of 2. 5 σ. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima Centauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of continuous darkness. Kipping 17 reported two tentative transit-like signals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation of <b>Stars</b> space <b>Telescope</b> in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The midtransit time of our detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit ephemeris. If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by an outer planet in this system.
