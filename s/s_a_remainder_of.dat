5000|$|For p = 11, we get [...] {{which is}} 93 and leaves <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 5 after {{division}} by 11, hence 11 {{is not a}} Wieferich prime.

5000|$|A {{much more}} {{efficient}} method is the Euclidean algorithm, which uses a division algorithm such as long division {{in combination with the}} observation that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. To compute gcd(48,18), divide 48 by 18 to get a quotient <b>of</b> 2 and <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 12. Then divide 18 by 12 to get a quotient <b>of</b> 1 and <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 0, which means that 6 is the gcd. Note that we ignored the quotient in each step except to notice when the remainder reached 0, signalling that we had arrived at the answer. Formally the algorithm can be described as: ...|$|R

25|$|However, the {{efficiency}} of PDVSA was brought into question over these years. During 1976–1992, the amount of PDVSA’s income that went towards the company's costs was on average 29 percent leaving <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 71 percent for the government. From 1993 to 2000, however, that distribution almost completely reversed, to where 64 percent of PDVSA's income were kept by PDVSA, leaving <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> only 36 percent for the government.|$|R

40|$|A ”space ” in {{this text}} is a Tychonoff topological space. We discuss {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>remainders</b> <b>of</b> metrizable spaces. Many recent results are presented. <b>A</b> <b>remainder</b> Y <b>of</b> <b>a</b> space X is the subspace Y = bX X of a Hausdorff compactification bX of X. One of the major tasks {{in the theory of}} compactifications is to find out how the properties of a space X are related to the properties of some or <b>of</b> all <b>remainders</b> <b>of</b> X. We are especially interested in the invariant properties <b>of</b> the <b>remainders,</b> that is, in the properties that do not depend on the choice of a compactification. The most interesting is the case when the space and the remainder are both densely located with respect to each other, that is, when each of them is dense in the compactification considered. Clearly, this happens when X is nowhere locally compact. Usually, we make this assumption below. Then Y is <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> X if and only if X is <b>a</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> Y. <b>A</b> systematic study <b>of</b> <b>remainders</b> <b>of</b> metrizable spaces have been initiate...|$|R
