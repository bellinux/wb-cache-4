40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{wireless}} technologies and providers, as well as users' increasing need and desire to be connected and reachable at all times, call for solutions that enable interoperation between providers and technologies. Roaming procedures enable wireless access {{in areas that are}} covered by network providers with which the user does not have any prior arrangements. <b>Handover</b> <b>procedures</b> enable the maintenance of ongoing connections while a user moves across different wireless access networks. The goal of this thesis is to model the security challenges imposed on infrastructurebased wireless access networks by inter-provider and inter-system roaming and <b>handover</b> <b>procedures,</b> to analyze current solutions in this model, and to develop new security solutions. In the first two parts of this thesis, the theoretical parts, we present new models for handover and roaming as well as new security solutions in a technology-independent way: In part II, the main part of this thesis, we develop a formal model for security-context transfer on various types of inter-provider <b>handover</b> <b>procedures.</b> As opposed to previous work our model explicitly captures security-context transfers on <b>subsequent</b> <b>handover</b> and handover after roaming. We present a thorough threat analysis of security solutions that are based on security-context transfers during inter-provider handover and define new security requirements based on this analysis. As state-of-the-art <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> do not meet our requirements, we present a new history-enriched, policy-based approach to enhance security-context transfers on inter-provider and inter-system handover. The main advantage of our new approach is that it allows mobile devices and networks to express policies with respect to whether or not a handover should take place, dependent on the history of previously used security mechanisms that is included in the security-context transfer. This protects users and providers from the impact of previously used weak security mechanisms. Moreover, in our procedures, users and networks can enforce policies with respect to the security mechanisms used after the current handover. This protects the handover participants from the impact of future use of weak security mechanisms. Furthermore, in part I, we model, classify and discuss roaming authentication protocols for wireless access networks in a technology-independent way. We introduce a new public-key-based approach for authentication upon roaming. As opposed to previous work on inter-provider roaming, our approach does not require a secure channel between the home and the foreign network. Moreover, as opposed to other public-key-based solutions, in our approach a mobile device is not required to obtain and validate a chain of public-key certificates. In the third part of this thesis, we analyze the roaming and <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> within and between GSM and UMTS. In particular, we present a man-in-the-middle attack against the authentication and key agreement based on UMTS-authentication vectors. This attack is enabled by a vulnerability in the inter-operation of UMTS with GSM. Furthermore, we discuss whether the inter-system <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> between GSM and UMTS meet the security requirements newly defined in the theoretical part. We show that attacks against the GSM encryption and a man-in-the-middle attack against the GSM authentication and key agreement {{have an impact on the}} security of a connection between a user and a UMTS network if a user is handed back and forth between UMTS and GSM. Finally, in the fourth part, we apply our new security solutions to roaming and handover between IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. In particular, we present a roaming authentication protocol EAP-TLS-KS that implements the new roaming solution. Furthermore we detail how the history-enriched, policy-based approach for inter-provider handover can be implemented in the WLAN context...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”With {{the advent}} of femtocells in {{cellular}} networks, the inter-cell handover process will become more complex, fre-quent and time-sensitive. The legacy <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> in 3 G and LTE systems were originally designed for handovers between macrocells whose base stations {{are part of the}} mobile core networks. The use of the public internet to connect the femtocell base station with the mobile core network will contribute to higher latency if such legacy <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> are employed over femtocells. This makes the legacy <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> slower, and in most cases inefficient. In the absence of a specific standardized procedure that involves femtocells, rather than using existing procedures designed to handle handovers between macrocells, we propose a new Prefetch-based Fast <b>Handover</b> <b>procedure</b> that is designed to overcome the drawbacks introduced by the usage of the public internet for message paths between femtocell base stations and the mobile core network. The new procedure can be introduced into the existing LTE infrastructure with few modifications to the femtocell base station architecture, and the core network packet flows. The proposed procedure simplifies and speeds the <b>handover</b> <b>procedure</b> at the cost of consuming more network resources at the femtocell base station. I...|$|R

30|$|Also taking {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} target handover BS is unique, the authors of[21] proposed an enhanced handover algorithm specifically designed for a railway environment. The processes defined in the standard <b>handover</b> <b>procedure</b> for scanning and association of other neighboring BSs during the cell-reselection phase can directly be omitted. Additionally, to minimize the service disruption time during the handover process, this enhanced handover algorithm also proposes the use of Fast DL_MAP_IE messages to forward downlink data after synchronization with the target BS. An important drawback of this approach is that it sacrifices compatibility in favor of performance, as it modifies the standard <b>handover</b> <b>procedures.</b> Additionally, it does not deal with the appropriate timing of the handover process. In other words, it does not define any handover policy for selecting the best instant at which to initiate <b>handover</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|R

In this study, the authors address an issue of consumer multicast traffic support in a Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) environment wherein network-based mobility management is deployed for MNs. The recently standardised PMIPv 6 multicast listener support provides options for deploying multicast listener functions in a PMIPv 6 domain, whereas it does not address specific optimisations and efficiency improvements of multicast routing.

30|$|Smart {{handover}} procedures: A {{critical part}} of the solution is the intelligence responsible for deciding when a flow has to be handed off to a different access network and when it has to be brought back. There are different handover-decision approaches that can be followed to maximize the overall performance (i.e., average bandwidth, end-to-end delay, etc.), while minimizing the potential side effects that <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> (e.g., signalling) may cause.

30|$|Proactive {{handover}} based: These schemes [41 â€“ 44] are on {{the assumption}} that the mobile host will issue a handover notification before moving. When receiving this notification, the current access router will communicate with the next access router where the host is going to access, and help the mobile host finish the <b>handover</b> <b>procedure</b> in advance. When this <b>handover</b> <b>procedure</b> is over, the current access router will notify the host, and the host can move to the new location seamlessly. In the paper [41], when the mobile host prepares to leave and issues a notification, the current access router will send a packet to related consumers containing the locator of the current and next access router of the mobile host. Then, another two packets, as replies, are sent by access routers of consumers to the current and next access router of the mobile host. Once the current access router of the mobile host receives the packet, which means the <b>handover</b> <b>procedure</b> is finished, it will tell the host to perform the handover.|$|R

Therefore, host mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) {{need to be}} extended to support this new type of mobility. To address the extensions needed for network mobility, the IETF NEMO working group has recently standardized the network mobility basic support protocol in RFC 3963. However, in this RFC, it is not mentioned how authentication authorization and accounting (AAA) issues are handled in NEMO environment. Also, the use of IPsec to secure NEMO procedures does not provide robustness against leakage of stored secrets. To address this security issue and to achieve AAA with mobility, we propose new <b>handover</b> <b>procedures</b> to be performed by mobile routers and by visiting mobile nodes.
