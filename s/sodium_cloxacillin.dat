40|$|An {{examination}} of teat canal swabs established that 51 teat canals out of 68 quarters of machine milked cows were colonized by Staphylococcus aureus. Only 31 of these quarters yielded milk from which S. aureus could be cultured, and 6 {{out of the}} 31 produced milk containing somatic cell counts in excess of 500 000 /mℓ. No inhibitory substances could be detected in milk samples 12 h after 10 mg of <b>sodium</b> <b>cloxacillin</b> had been deposited in the teat canal on 1 - 4 successive occasions. Teat canal swabs and milk sample cultures of the same quarters became and remained bacteriologically negative {{for at least a}} week after the last treatment. Six quarters, which according to the International Dairy Federation criteria were suffering from subclinical mastitis, became negative after local teat canal therapy. Scanning electron micrographs of one infected teat canal revealed the presence of cocci in depressions and crevices on the epithelial surface, suggesting that such cocci are not always flushed out into milk samples. Teat canal therapy should make a marked contribution to the control of bovine mastitis. This article has been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the main purpose of investigating the effects of antibiotic therapy applied during lactation on the subclinically infected quarters in terms of bacterial infection, somatic cell count (S. C. C.), milk yield and composition (i. e. milkfat and protein percentage). The main objectives involved were:- (1) To identify cows with high somatic cell counts (subclinical mastitis) in early lactation. (2) To identify the individual quarters with high somatic cell counts and bacterial infection. (3) To treat some of these high S. C. C. quarters with an antibiotic, and leave some of them untreated (control quarters). (4) To measure the effects of treatment on S. C. C., bacterial infection, yield and composition of milk. During weeks four to six of lactation 12 cows from a herd of 100 cows at No. 3 Dairy Research & Development Unit, Massey University, were identified to have consistently high values for somatic cell counts. Milk samples were aseptically taken from the individual quarters of these cows and subjected to bacteriological tests. Eight subclinically infected quarters with high somatic cell counts were subsequently treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>cloxacillin</b> (Orbenin) formulated in a slow release base. Before antibiotic treatment of any quarters, there was a close association between infection and somatic cell counts in individual quarters. Thus only 12 % of the quarters which showed no infection had somatic cell counts higher than 300, 000 cells/ml, whereas the corresponding proportion of infected quarters was 74 %. Out of the eight infected quarters which were treated with antibiotic, five were cured of infection (62. 5 % cure rate); in these quarters the average S. C. C. was greatly reduced from 4, 207, 000 cells/ml before treatment to about 160, 000 cells/ml afterwards whereas the three quarters which were treated but not cured showed a slight decrease from 3, 991, 200 cells/ml before treatment to 2, 638, 800 cells/ml after treatment. The average somatic cell counts of the five infected control quarters increased slightly from their original value of about 2, 061, 500 cells/ml up to 2, 111, 000 cells/ml. There was no significant or consistent effect of antibiotic therapy, successful or otherwise, on milk yield from individual quarters. However adjusted means showed a 10 % non-significant difference between the successfully treated quarters and the untreated control quarters in favour of the cured quarters. The effects of treatment on milk composition were small and were significant only for protein percentage. The practical implications of the results were discussed. From the results obtained firm conclusions on the effects of antibiotic therapy of subclinically infected quarters on milk yield, and composition were not possible. The major benefit {{is likely to be the}} reduction in the number of infected quarters, and the consequent reduction in the risk of new infection in other quarters. It is however suggested that more work is required to establish the actual effect of antibiotic therapy by obtaining information on the performance of the successfully treated quarters in the following lactation...|$|E

One type, that of channel formation, is investigated. The high linear velocity of solvent and solvent pulsing during the pumping cycle were found to be the cause of this damage. The applicability of nonisotherrnal kinetic experiments to penicillin V preparations, including formulated paediatric syrups, is evaluated. A new type of nonisotherrnal analysis, based on slope estimation and using a 64 K Random Access Memory (R. A. M.) microcomputer is described. The name of the program written for this analysis is NONISO. The distribution of active penicillin in granules for reconstitution into ampicillin and penicillin V syrups, and its effect on the stability of the reconstituted products, are investigated. Changing the diluent used to reconstitue the syrups was found to affect the stability of the product. Dissolution and stability of benzathine cloxacillin at pH 2, pH 6 and pH 9 is described, with proposed dissolution mechanisms and kinetic analysis to support these mechanisms.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} withdrawal periods and tissue tolerance of intramammary antibiotics (Curaclox LC, Spectrazol Milking Cow and Rilexine 200 LC) in goats, measured in different ways, and to evaluate the effects of related factors. Method: Three experimental trials were conducted. Trial 1 and Trial 2 were conducted at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Onderstepoort using the goat herd of the Onderstepoort Teaching Animal Unit (OTAU) (Herd A), while Trial 3 was conducted on a commercial goat dairy in the Limpopo Province of South Africa (Herd B). In addition, four goats with clinical mastitis from a smallholding close to the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Onderstepoort were studied (Herd C). This herd consisted of 13 lactating Saanen and Saanen/Toggenburg crossbred dairy goats. In all trials foremilk was stripped, teats were disinfected and a milk sample was taken from each udder half of each goat (half-milk samples). In all three trials the following milk samples were taken: two sets of half samples and a composite sample (before, during and after treatment). The California Milk Cell Test (CMCT) and conductivity measurements were performed. In Trial 3 the conductivity meter became non-functional on the second day, and thus the conductivity test was eliminated from then on. Each udder half was milked separately and milk volume was recorded. The temperature of goats was taken and recorded to identify sick animals. All goats in the treatment group were treated. In all three trials after treatment, sampling continued until SCC returned to baseline and until there were at least two consecutive negative TRIS tests for each goat, approximately 10 days. Milk production was based on the following milk production groups: low (less than 1. 3 L), medium (1. 3 L to 1. 5 L) and high (greater than 1. 5 L) daily milk production. The antibiotics used in these trials were selected for being commonly used, broad-spectrum preparations. Trial 1, a semi-synthetic penicillin based intramammary preparation (Curaclox LC, which contains 75 mg sodium ampicillin and 200 mg <b>sodium</b> <b>cloxacillin</b> per dose plus blue dye). Curaclox LC G 2615, (Norbrook (Pharmacia AH) P. O. Box 10698 Centurion, 0046), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringe. Trial 2, a cefuroxime 250 mg based intramammary product (Spectrazol Milking Cow, Schering-Plough). Spectrazol milking cow, cefuroxime, 250 mg, S 4 Intramammary Injection 83 / 594, (Schering-Plough Animal Health, P. O. BOX 46, Isando, 1600). Trial 3, a cephalexin 100 mg, neomycin sulphate 100 mg and prednisolone based intramammary product, Rilexine (SA) 200 LC injection 83 / 638, (Logos Agvet (Virbac), Private bag X 115, Halfway House, 1685). Curaclox LC G 2615, Norbrook (Pharmacia AH), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringes. In the clinical mastitis cases (Herd C); Goat 1 was treated with Spectrazol milking cow (as above), Goat 2 was treated with Curaclox LC (as above), Goat 3 was treated with Curaclox LC in the left udder half and Goat 4 was treated with Curaclox LC in the right udder half (as above). Results: Trial 1 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for the product Curaclox LC (intramammary) as measured by Thermo Resistant Inhibitory Substances (TRIS), colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on eight relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 1) were 74 h ± 19. 21; 90 h ± 16. 97; 99 h ± 9. 07 and 93 h ± 11. 41 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal periods as measured by colour dye (P < 0. 001), Parallux testing for cloxacillin (P < 0. 001) and Parallux testing for ampicillin (P < 0. 05) in Trial 1. There was a significant difference of withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 05) and colour dye (P < 0. 05) between goats with and without clinical mastitis in Trial 1 Trial 3 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on 12 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) were 42 h ± 7. 08; 65 h ± 60. 26; 77 h ± 13. 56 and 71 h ± 12. 65 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) and colour dye (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. Curaclox LC: Trials 1 & 3 combined The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, for Trials 1 & 3 combined were 59 h ± 24. 31; 76 h ± 17. 70; 87 h ± 16. 10 and 80 h ± 16. 23 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trials 1 & 3 combined. Trial 2 : Spectrazol Milking Cow The mean withdrawal periods for Spectrazol Milking Cow (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on seven relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 2) was 95 h ± 17. 23. The withdrawal period for Spectrazol Milking Cow recommended for use in cattle (60 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 2. Trial 3 : Rilexine 200 LC The mean withdrawal periods for Rilexine 200 LC (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on 20 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) was 37 h ± 9. 94. The withdrawal period for Rilexine 200 LC recommended for use in cattle (96 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. The regression model for goats with clinical mastitis was: Withdrawal period as measured by TRIS = 30. 21 + 4. 692 (sampling time) + 22. 11 (udder palpation) – 13. 6 (floccules) – 0. 00649 (volume) (R 2 = 95. 7 %, standard error of regression = 3. 41) There was great variation in Somatic Cell Count (SCC) between trials, ranging from 1928 X 103 cells/mL to 9274 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 1817 X 103 cells/mL to 3639 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves, at the morning milking. At the evening milking SCC ranged from 1927 X 103 cells/mL to 6415 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 2103 X 103 cells/mL to 3304 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves. SCC of udder halves with clinical mastitis ranged from 7053 X 103 cells/mL to 7948 X 103 cells/mL for udder halves in which bacteria could not be isolated and from 6476 X 103 cells/mL to 8479 X 103 cells/mL in udder halves from which bacteria was isolated. Most of the variation in SCC was unexplained. In this research all SCC values were determined using the Fossomatic 90 counter and the arithmetic means were reported. The factors valid for determining clinical mastitis were the presence of floccules in the milk and high SCC, with or without udder damage and/ or bacteria. Intramammary infection (IMI) was determined by the presence or absence of bacteria only. Conclusions and Recommendations: The variability in SCC was largely unexplained, and an increased SCC did not necessarily indicate an intramammary infection in goats, as it does in cows. Therefore further, research is required to assess SCC and all possible factors affecting it. Further research is also required to find a more reliable method for mastitis diagnosis apart from SCC, for example, NAGase. The “Goatside” tests used (California Milk Cell Tests, CMCT) and SCC on their own were not reliable methods of mastitis diagnosis and should be accompanied by microbiological tests. However, CMCT and SCC were indicators of tissue tolerance and udder irritation. Tissue irritation is considered to indicate the limit of tissue tolerance. In healthy goats Spectrazol Milking cow caused the least tissue irritation, followed by Rilexine 200 LC, and Curaclox LC. However, for goats with clinical mastitis Rilexine 200 LC caused the least tissue irritation followed by Curaclox LC; and Spectrazol Milking cow caused the most tissue irritation in goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal periods of healthy goats and goats with clinical mastitis also differed for each product. Further research is necessary to determine withdrawal periods and tissue irritation of different intramammary products on goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal period was affected by volume of milk produced, due to the dilution factor of continuous milk secretion. High producers had shorter withdrawal periods than low producers. However, treatment with intramammary antibiotics did not significantly affect the volume of milk produced. Further research is required to assess the effect of milk production volume on withdrawal periods when comparing withdrawal periods of different products. Antibiotic withdrawal periods on goat milk were different from those recommended for use in cattle for each of the products used and for the different intramammary antibiotics used. The withdrawal periods recommended for use cattle have a 24 h safety margin added to the longest withdrawal period in the trial. In this research 24 h safety margins were not added in the original tables. Therefore, in practice 24 h safety margins should be added to all withdrawal periods in this research. Later the 24 h safety margins were subtracted from the withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle in order to obtain a rough estimate of the actual withdrawal periods in cattle. In this analysis all withdrawal periods measured by different methods for goats were significantly different from withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle (- 24 h safety margin). However, in the original tables not all withdrawal periods for goats as measured by different methods were significantly different from those in cattle (with 24 h safety margin). Conductivity was found to be an unreliable “Goatside” test. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Production Animal Studiesunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{magnitude}} of the interaction of penicillins with serum albumin has important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic implications. Mechanism of interaction of three isoxazolyl penicillins, <b>cloxacillin</b> <b>sodium,</b> dicloxacillin sodium and flucloxacillin sodium with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) has been studied using fluorescence spectroscopic technique. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of HSA under different conditions and fluorescent probe displacement studies were carried out. The stoichiometry of the interaction {{was found to be}} 1 : 1 in each case. The association constants were of the order of 10 4 in the case of all the drug samples. The order of association constants was dicloxacillin sodium > flucloxacillin sodium>cloxacillin sodium. The nature of drug-protein interaction could be predicted from the thermodynamic parameters for the binding. The binding was predominantly through hydrophobic interactions in the case of cloxacillin. In the case of dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin, hydrogen bonding as well as hydrophobic interactions contributed to the interaction. Binding studies carried out in the presence of hydrophobic probe, ANS showed that the drugs and ANS do not share common site on the albumin molecule. Displacement of DSS from its binding site on albumin showed that site II is involved in binding. Stern-Volmer analysis of fluorescence data revealed that the tryptophan residues of serum albumin are not fully accessible to drugs, drug binding site is in close proximity to the tryptophan residues and predominantly static quenching mechanism is operative...|$|R
