5|$|Harland <b>Sanders</b> {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When <b>Sanders</b> was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left <b>Sanders,</b> as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, <b>Sanders</b> passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, <b>Sanders</b> purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for <b>Sanders</b> to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it <b>Sanders</b> Court & Café.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, <b>Sanders</b> {{took over}} the lease of the Pure Oil filling station {{on the other side}} of the road, due to its greater {{visibility}} for motorists.

By 1936, his business had proved successful enough for him to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937, <b>Sanders</b> expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the <b>Sanders</b> Court & Café.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von <b>Sanders</b> had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von <b>Sanders</b> was not surprised by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von <b>Sanders</b> deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|In New York, <b>Sanders</b> {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses.

5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular <b>Sanders,</b> making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to <b>Sanders</b> by a wide margin. <b>Sanders</b> was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.

5|$|<b>Sanders</b> {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. <b>Sanders</b> bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of <b>Sanders,</b> retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E
