40|$|Abstract. The {{heart of}} skype services, {{one of the}} most {{ubiquitous}} P 2 P networks, is based on a set of super nodes. Choosing stable SNs is an important task, since it improves the whole performance and quality of the P 2 P network [1, 2]. In this paper we shed light on the life cycle of SNs using extensive data sets on Skype Super nodes, which were gathered over a period of 3 months. We then suggest how to choose a more stable SNs set. The dynamic of nodes is inherent to the use of a computer, which is unplugged for some time or is mobile. Hence it is natural to predict that a Super Node would have multiple sessions correlated with the time the computer is up. Surprisingly, we show that 40 % of the Super Nodes have only one session, with median residual life time of 1. 75 days. These nodes also have a significantly shorter lifespan than Super Nodes that have multiple sessions, which have median residual life time of 67. 5 days. We propose and give evidence that nodes with one session are nodes with dynamic IP addresses, and hence they have ended their life cycle due to a change of IP address. We show that the nodes with multiple sessions are mostly nodes with <b>static</b> <b>IPs,</b> and that choosing super nodes with <b>static</b> <b>IPs</b> would increase the availability and stability of the P 2 P network significantly. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing of DSL {{services}} in Taiwan. DSL service is an overwhelmingly popular mode of Internet access in Taiwan, {{and the net}} penetration in Taiwan is ranked the tenth in the world. Both the stage of Taiwan’s Internet development and {{the popularity of the}} DSL service make Taiwan a good choice for such study. The characteristics of DSL services which are economically meaningful to both the ISPs and household users were first selected through a hedonic approach. Then Box-Cox methodology was used to determine the appropriate data transformation that best fits a regression model. The circuit fee and the number of <b>static</b> <b>IPs</b> are found to be the two most important characteristics that affect the pricing, with the circuit fee being the key factor due to its substantially larger coefficient. In addition, a dummy variable which represents Taiwan Fixed Network, a smaller player in the arena, turned out to be significant. Its negative coefficient indicates that the DSL service offered by TFN’s was priced lower than the industry average. This reduction in price could be a result of TFN’s decision of entering a price-war. This study offers insights to how DSL services are priced in regions with similar profiles as Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{discovery}} of complete problems for a complexity class typically not only results in {{greater understanding of}} the class and the problems that lie in it, but also often provides new insight and a surprising alternative characterization of the class. The complexity classes dened via interactive proof systems [5] provide two good examples of such alternative characterizations. The rst surprise came when Shamir [10] proved 1 that IP, the class of languages that admit interactive proof systems, has complete problems, which established that the class coincides with PSPACE, the class of languages decidable using a polynomially space-bounded Turing machine. This result not only established that interactive proofs can prove much more than classical proofs (assuming NP (PSPACE), but also gave a <b>static</b> characterization of <b>IP</b> without any reference to interaction or proof protoco...|$|R
40|$|Network-layer {{authentication}} {{security services}} are typically pessimistic and <b>static.</b> A conservative <b>IP</b> security gateway checks/verifies the authentication information for every packet it forwards.

We propose a security protocol, SSGP (Sleepy Security Gateway Protocol), residing {{on top of the}} IPSEC (Internet Security Protocol). One important feature of SSGP is the collaboration model between network and application layer security mechanisms. 1 Introduction In the Internet, the demilitarized zones (DMZ) separated by firewalls or security gateways[CB 94] are static.

40|$|Nowadays, mobile devices {{support a}} variety of {{multimedia}} applications such as live video, radio or online gaming. People spend their time on mobile devices for entertainment more and more via the internet. Due {{to the requirements of}} multimedia applications over wireless communication those applications require a huge bandwidth on the network to support them, which creates problems for the network provider. However, one pattern that is appropriate for the efficient delivery of multimedia messages is multicast delivery. Multicast services do, however, introduce challenges within the network when the recipients of the service are moving. Powerful multicast routing protocols are designed for <b>static</b> client <b>IP</b> addresses. Hence, when the mobile node changes the location, it introduces the problem of access network handover. Therefore, this is the aim of the research where a new framework will be developed for multicast mobility within WiFi network to reduce and provide smooth mobility when handover occurs. This research is focused on techniques to reduce handover latency, minimize packet loss and provide connection when a user moves between network zones. To achieve these aims, this designed framework lets mobile nodes send the message to register to foreign agents in advance for addressing IP address of the new zone and to establish the multicast tree earlier. Moreover, there are processes that keep the connection of the path alive. The framework is being simulated on OPNET Modeler for evaluating the performance in terms of handover latency time, the number of packet loss and so on. There are many scenarios that have been tested. According to the results, it shows that the new framework has reduced handover latency time around 60...|$|R

A significant amount of malicious activities have been reported from dynamic IP space, such as spamming, botnets, etc [...] Accurate identification of dynamic IP addresses will help build blacklists of suspicious hosts with more confidence, and help track the sources of different types of anomalous activities. In this paper, we contrast traffic activity patterns between <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>IP</b> addresses in a large campus network, as well as their activity patterns when countering outside scanning traffic. Based on the distinct characteristics observed, we propose a scanning-based technique for identifying dynamic IP addresses in blocks.
