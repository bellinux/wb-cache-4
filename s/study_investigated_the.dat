5|$|Termite populations can be {{substantially}} impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under {{different levels of}} anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). A 1991 <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> daily routine of the {{antelope}} and found feeding peaks at dawn, in the morning, {{in the afternoon}} and during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal), the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India), herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and male groups with two to 18 members.|$|E
25|$|Other studies {{indicated}} that the caries preventive effect of chewing sugar-free gum {{is related to the}} chewing process itself rather than being an effect of gum sweeteners or additives, such as polyols and carbamide. A <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> in situ effect of casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) found that its incorporation into a sugar-free gum increases the remineralization / protection of eroded enamel surface significantly.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of miRNAs as potential markers for cancers. MicroRNAs have shown promise in this area due to their stability and specificity to cells and tumors. A recent <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> use of miRNA as a biomarker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a form of pancreatic cancer. The study analyzed RNA from biopsied pancreatic cysts to identify deviations in expression of miRNAs. The study found that 228 miRNAs were expressed differently relative to normal pancreatic cells. Included in the findings was an association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the upregulation of miR-92a, a member of OncomiR-1.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> {{interaction}} between bisphenolA's and estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also {{protect it from}} deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-γ {{in different parts of}} the body may account for variations in bisphenolA effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol accumulation in this tissue. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, citing budget considerations, the {{director}} of the MTA, Joe Lhota, said that it was doubtful the extension would be built in the foreseeable future, suggesting that the Gateway Project was a much more likely solution to congestion at Hudson River crossings. However, the Parsons Brinckerhoff feasibility study, which was released in April 2013, revived hope for the project, with Mayor Bloomberg saying, [...] "Extending the 7 train to Secaucus is a promising potential solution ... and is deserving of serious consideration."

2500|$|A recent <b>study</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> Calliphoridae {{population}} {{present on}} pig carcasses {{in three different}} Texas cities during the summer months. Results showed that in two consecutive years, there was a considerable difference in the abundance of L. mexicana found in the three cities of Junction, Guadalupe, and Lubbock {{from one year to}} the next. Therefore, L. mexicana, among other calliphorids, can fluctuate in abundance at different individual locations over successive years.
