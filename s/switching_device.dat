5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E

40|$|Experimentations and {{performance}} analysis following designs and developments of energy efficient switchable distribution transformers are of first significant step as it reveals improvements, {{such as in}} energy efficiency, {{through the use of}} unique configurations and <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in the transformers. This paper explains a personal computer based application and hardware, using lab VIEW and a data acquisition (DAQ) card, that have been used for acquiring and analyzing data from the transformers and <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> A 3 -phase 10 kVA energy efficient switchable distribution transformer and some types of <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> were utilized in some experimentations. Generally in the implementation, the developed application will firstly configure the tappings of the windings through the use of some <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> and then acquire important information such as waveforms of voltages and currents by using developed hardware and the DAQ card. The analysis is performed to show improvements in the efficiency, power factor and voltage regulation. The application also provides a protection to transformers under a test by turning off the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in case of a fault detected. Results reveal that the system can work well with the implemented transformer and <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> in the experimentations. Finally, this system can be further developed to perform full automation in experimentations {{and performance}} analysis of switchable transformers. ...|$|R
30|$|Future {{work should}} also {{consider}} {{details of the}} <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Different patients are able to use different muscles to control a <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> A person who uses eye blinks (Bauby, 1997), a sip-puff headset, or manipulates EEG signals (Serby, Yom-Tov & Inbar, 2005) may produce very different error probabilities than what is reported here and thus would require different keyboard designs. Future work should also explore easier methods of estimating and modeling a user’s ability to use the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Koester & Simpson (2014) simply measured how well users could trigger single, double, and triple clicks of the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Such an approach would be much faster than the empirical approach used here. Likewise, Simpson, Koester and LoPresti (2007) proposed that an appropriate cursor duration is one that generates a ratio of the user’s reaction time and the cursor duration equal to 0.65. If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities. Regardless of the empirical method, once the error probabilities for a user’s ability with a <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> are identified and modeled, the optimization algorithm described here can be readily applied.|$|R
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{cascaded}} transformer multilevel inverter is proposed. The {{number of}} the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced in the proposed topology. This topology comprises of a DC source, several single phase low-frequency transformers, two main power switches and some bidirectional <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> In this topology, only one bidirectional switch is employed for each transformer. However, in conventional cascaded transformer multilevel inverter, four <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> are required for each transformer. Therefore, more output voltage levels can be obtained using fewer switching components. Reduction {{in the number of}} <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> which also means {{reduction in the number of}} gate drivers results in smaller size and low implementation cost. Switching power losses are also reduced in this topology. Selective harmonic elimination (SHE) technique is applied to the proposed inverter to obtain a high quality output voltage. Simulation and experimental results are also provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed converter...|$|R

2500|$|Most of the HVDC {{systems in}} {{operation}} today {{are based on}} line-commutated converters (LCC). [...] The term line-commutated indicates that the conversion process relies on the line voltage of the AC system to which the converter is connected in order to effect the commutation from one <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> to its neighbour. Line-commutated converters use switching devices that are either uncontrolled (such as diodes) or {{that can only be}} turned on (not off) by control action, such as thyristors. Although HVDC converters can, in principle, be constructed from diodes, such converters can only be used in rectification mode and the lack of controllability of the DC voltage is a serious disadvantage. [...] Consequently, in practice all LCC HVDC systems use either grid-controlled mercury-arc valves (until the 1970s) or thyristors (to the present day).|$|E
