40|$|In a {{retrospective}} study on cytological specimens from 86 patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, the prognostic value of nucleolar morphometric variables was studied and compared with nuclear variables. One hundred nuclei and their nucleoli on each slide were {{measured with a}} graphic tablet system at a total magnification of 2800 times using a <b>stratified</b> <b>selection</b> method. The number of nucleoli per 100 nuclei was also noted. Analysis of Kaplan-Meier univariate recurrence free survival curves showed significant differences for eight nuclear features, nine nucleolar features, and three combined nuclear and nucleolar variables. The total number of nucleoli per 100 nuclei was the best single prognostic variable. Multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model) showed that no other features provided additional prognostic information beyond that given {{by the total number}} of nucleoli. It is concluded that nucleolar morphometric variables assessed in cytological preparations have prognostic value in breast cancer, and the results of this study suggest that their prognostic value may exceed that of nuclear variables...|$|E

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} to use unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models to estimate ability in multidimensional data. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the implications of summarizing multiple dimensions of ability into a single parameter estimate, especially if effects are confounded when applied to computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Previous studies have investigated the effects of different IRT models and ability estimators by manipulating the relationships between item and person parameters. However, in all cases, the maximum information criterion was used as the item selection method. Because maximum information is heavily influenced by the item discrimination parameter, investigating a-stratified item selection methods is tenable. The current Monte Carlo study compared maximum information, a-stratification, and a-stratification with b blocking item selection methods, alone, as well as in combination with the Sympson-Hetter exposure control strategy. The six testing conditions were conditioned on three levels of interdimensional item difficulty correlations and four levels of interdimensional examinee ability correlations. Measures of fidelity, estimation bias, error, and item usage were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods. Results showed either <b>stratified</b> item <b>selection</b> strategy is warranted if the goal is to obtain precise estimates of ability when using unidimensional CAT in the presence of two-dimensional data. If the goal also includes limiting bias of the estimate, Sympson-Hetter exposure control should be included. Results also confirmed that Sympson-Hetter is effective in optimizing item pool usage. Given these results, existing unidimensional CAT implementations might consider employing a <b>stratified</b> item <b>selection</b> routine plus Sympson-Hetter exposure control, rather than recalibrate the item pool under a multidimensional model...|$|R

It has caused many banks to collapse, and many investors and depositors funds were trapped. In fact, it has prevented many banks from achieving their goals and many businesses went into liquidation. Since the last few decades, {{asset misappropriation}} is prevalent especially in financial service industry. In addition, employee fraud is the most prevalent type of fraud experienced by organizations. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to provide a more in depth view on the reasons of assets perpetrations conducted by bank employees in Iran. The exploratory study adopts quantitative methods to reach a better grasp of the reasons of why bank staffs commit fraud at work. The sample size of the current research is comprised of 200 bank managers and employees from top three banks in the banking industry of Iran, namely Bank Melli Iran, Bank Saderat Iran and Bank Tejarat Iran. All the respondents were chosen based on the <b>stratified</b> <b>selection</b> method among those who have two in common characteristics, firstly, being informed about details of fraud in the banking industry of Iran, and secondly being decision maker. The result of the paper enhanced the existing literature further in understanding the concept of fraud and assets misappropriation in Iran. Findings are useful for policy makers, managers at banking system and practitioners to improve safety of banking mechanisms in Iran.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} genetic parameters and identify promising clones of Spondias mombin in ungrafted commercial crop by <b>stratified</b> mass <b>selection,</b> {{based on the}} average of two harvests, using mixed models. The base population growing on a private farm in Teresina/PI comprised 82 plants, which were evaluated in the growing seasons 2008 and 2009. Total titratable acidity (TTA), total soluble solids (Brix), Brix/TTA, fruit weight (FW), seed weight (SW), pulp yield (PuY), and processing yield (PrY) were measured. Significant genetic variation among plants was detected for all traits. The coefficients of repeatability were 0. 97 (TTA), 0. 39 (Brix), 0. 86 (Brix/TTA), 0. 84 (FW), 0. 82 (SW), 0. 35 (PuY), and 0. 39 (PrY). The chemical were generally not correlated with the physical fruit traits. Ranking by predicted phenotypic values associated with PrY and Brix/TTA identified nine promising plants (PrY> 6. 9 % and Brix/TTA> 10) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the BLUP selection method with different selection strategies in F 2 : 4 and assess the efficiency of this method on the early choice of the best common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lines. Fifty-one F 2 : 4 progenies were produced from a cross between the CVIII 8511 x RP- 26 lines. A randomized block design was used with 20 replications and one-plant field plots. Character data on plant architecture and grain yield were obtained and then the sum of the standardized variables was estimated for simultaneous selection of both traits. Analysis was carried out by mixed models (BLUP) and the least squares method to compare different selection strategies, like mass <b>selection,</b> <b>stratified</b> mass <b>selection</b> and between and within progeny selection. The progenies selected by BLUP were assessed in advanced generations, always selecting the greatest and smallest sum of the standardized variables. Analyses by the least squares method and BLUP procedure ranked the progenies in the same way. The coincidence of the individuals identified by BLUP and between and within progeny selection was high and of the greatest magnitude when BLUP was compared with mass selection. Although BLUP is the best estimator of genotypic value, its efficiency in the response to long term selection is not different from any of the other methods, because it is also unable to predict the future effect of the progenies x environments interaction. It was inferred that selection success will always depend on the most accurate possible progeny assessment and using alternatives to reduce the progenies x environments interaction effect. 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Wild geese {{foraging}} on farmland cause increasing {{conflicts with}} agricultural interests, {{calling for a}} strategic approach to mitigation. In central Norway, conflicts between farmers and spring-staging pink-footed geese feeding on pastures have escalated. To alleviate the conflict, a scheme by which farmers are subsidized to allow geese to forage undisturbed was introduced. To guide allocation of subsidies, an ecological-based ranking of fields at a regional level was recommended and applied. Here we evaluate the scheme. On average, 40 % of subsidized fields were in the top 5 % of the ranking, and 80 % were within the top 20 %. Goose grazing pressure on subsidized pastures was 13 times higher compared to a <b>stratified</b> random <b>selection</b> of non-subsidized pastures, capturing 67 % of the pasture feeding geese despite that subsidized fields only comprised 13 % of the grassland area. Close dialogue between scientists and managers {{is regarded as a}} key {{to the success of the}} scheme...|$|R
