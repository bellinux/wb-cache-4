He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E

Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches.

Tischendorf during his investigation in Petersburg enumerated 14,800 corrections only in the portion which was held in Petersburg (2/3 of the codex). According to David C. Parker the full codex has about 23,000 corrections. In addition to these corrections some letters were marked by dots as doubtful (e.g. ṪḢ). Corrections represent the Byzantine text-type, just like corrections in codices: Bodmer II, Regius (L), Ephraemi (C), and Sangallensis (Δ). They were discovered by E.A. Button.|$|E

The original album mix of the title track is not available as a single and the original mix was kept for future reissues of the album, unlike the two songs mentioned in the upper note, The single mix did not replace the title track on all future reissues.|$|E

In Dubai, Federer successfully defended his title with a straight-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, marking his seventh title at the tournament and, after Wimbledon and Halle, was the third time he had won <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> more titles in a tournament.

5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite different degrees of whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Henry VII touched <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> eight {{infected}} people annually, {{and there}} were intervals lasting several years during {{which he did not}} perform the ritual at all. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) apparently did not perform the ritual, but the Catholic Mary I (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously. Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant to participate in a ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated her and alleged that she had lost her healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing. The Elizabethan surgeon William Clowes, who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.|$|E
5|$|In early May Cochrane was escorting {{a convoy}} from Cagliari to Leghorn. On 11May a ship {{which turned out}} to be the 6-gun {{privateer}} Intrépide was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane chased the Intrépide and forced her to surrender. Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of Montecristo, five rowing boats emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning. He was then given a free hand to raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured <b>seven</b> <b>or</b> eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer Asuncion off Bastia on 25June and the privateer Constitution off Caprea on 19 July. On 22September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into Port Mahon, discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his depredations and were preparing a frigate to capture Speedy.|$|E
