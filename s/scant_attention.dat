5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given <b>scant</b> <b>attention,</b> and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E

30|$|When firms start {{intrapreneurship}} by merger or acquisition, {{the level}} and pattern of human resource integration becomes a critical issue. However, extant literature has paid <b>scant</b> <b>attentions</b> to this issue. Drawing on the previous researches on M&A intrapreneurship, the present article collected primary data of {{the level and}} pattern of human resource integration in M&A intrapreneurship by means of in-depth interviews and used content analysis method to structurally analyze the data. The results showed that enterprises engaging in M&A intrapreneurship generally choose a high or intermediate level of HR integration. Specifically, enterprises at high level of HR integration tend to absorb employees from the acquired directly or recruit afresh employees, while enterprises at intermediate level of HR integration are inclined to adopt an agent-type of integration pattern.|$|R
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E

25|$|Smith found a like-minded man in Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar, who {{presented}} Smith's petition to Congress on February 12, 1900. It {{was identified as}} Senate document number 209 by the 56th Congress, First Session, and 5,000 copies were printed. Unfortunately for Smith, the United States was engaged in the Philippine–American War, and Senator Hoar was one of President William McKinley's strongest critics. The majority of politicians were so preoccupied with the war that they paid <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> to an issue of culture. When Hoar died in 1904, Smith's plan died with him.|$|E
25|$|Cohl's {{financial}} situation deteriorated during the Great Depression and he endured years of severe poverty. While his peer, George Méliès {{was awarded the}} Legion of Honor medal in 1931, <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> was given Cohl's pioneering work in animated film. In the spring of 1937, {{at the age of}} 80, his face was lightly burned when a candle on his desk set fire to his beard. During a couple of months stay at a charity hospital, the young film journalist René Jeanne helped organize a benefit screening of his work, which played at the Champs-Elysées Cinema on January 19, 1938, the day before Cohl's death, two weeks after his 81st birthday. Coincidentally, Georges Méliès died hours later. Cohl's ashes are kept in the columbarium of the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Session of the Central Council, held in Moscow from March 9–15, 1926, began {{just as the}} 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI came to a close. At both {{of these}} gatherings Solomon Lozovsky had {{delivered}} reports which identified Great Britain — where a miners' strike {{was in the air}} — and in particular the countries of Asia and the Pacific as areas presenting the greatest opportunities for the Profintern in its attempt to construct a world revolutionary movement. Amsterdam had paid <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> to Asia, leaving the field open to the Profintern's efforts, Lozovsky noted in his report to the Comintern Executive. RILU did make an effort to break new organizational ground outside of Europe as early as February 1922 when it established a Moscow office comparable to the Comintern's Eastern Bureau, headed by Buffalo, New York druggist Boris Reinstein, Bulgarian-American IWW member George Andreychine, and H. Eiduss. But now, even as European prospects dimmed, the situation looked brighter in Asia and the Pacific.|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of the Roman world, few {{demographics}} receive <b>scanter</b> <b>attention</b> from modern scholarship than those time-served veterans who eschewed an agricultural life in favour of setting up in business for themselves. This study, then, is an examination of this class of men and the evidence we have for them. Modern scholarship’s apathy in this field of study is no doubt an effect of the lack of anything more than sparse one-dimensional references to veterans in the ancient literary sources, an aspect this paper will also examine. The study likewise challenges the idea that all soldiers inevitably retired to farmland by highlighting the topoi surrounding both rural life and the soldiery, as well as providing a more practical analysis of the options open to the veteran upon discharge. By taking evidence directly from inscriptions, this study throws light on those veterans who set up as manufacturers and traders of various commodities, and discusses the reasons why they are so elusive within the epigraphic record itself. Summaries of the key themes of the study, along with potential avenues of further research, are offered in the conclusion...|$|R

25|$|Other {{significant}} {{painters of}} the first generation were the Panther Painter, the Anagyrus Painter, the Painter of the Dresden Lekanis and the Polos Painter. The last significant representative {{of the first}} generation of painters was Sophilos (580–570 BC), who is the first Attic vase painter known by name. In all, he signed four surviving vases, three as painter and one as potter, revealing that at this date potters were also painters of vases in the black-figure style. A fundamental separation of both crafts seems to have occurred only {{in the course of the}} development of the red-figure style, although prior specialization cannot be ruled out. Sophilos makes liberal use of annotations. He apparently specialized in large vases, since especially dinos and amphoras are known to be his work. Much more frequently than his predecessors, Sophilos shows mythological scenes like the funeral games for Patroclus. The decline of the animal frieze begins with him, and plant and other ornaments are also of lower quality since they are regarded as less important and thus receive <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> from the painter. But in other respects Sophilos shows that he was an ambitious artist. On two dinos the marriage of Peleus and Thetis is depicted. These vases were produced at about the same time as the François vase, which depicts this subject to perfection. However, Sophilos does without any trimmings in the form of animal friezes on one of his two dinos, and he does not combine different myths in scenes distributed over various vase surfaces. It is the first large Greek vase showing a single myth in several interrelated segments. A special feature of the dinos is the painter's application of the opaque white paint designating women directly on the clay foundation, and not as usual on the black gloss. The figure's interior details and contours are painted in a dull red. This particular technique is rare, only found in vases painted in Sophilos' workshop and on wooden panels painted in the Corinthian style in the 6th century BC. Sophilos also painted one of the rare chalices (a variety of goblet) and created the first surviving series of votive tablets. He himself or one of his successors also decorated the first marriage vase (known as a lebes gamikos) to be found.|$|E

500|$|The Owens Valley had {{received}} <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> from European Americans before the early 1860s, {{as it was}} little more than a crossroads of the routes through the area. When gold and silver were discovered in the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains, the resulting sudden influx of miners, farmers, cattlemen and their hungry herds brought conflict with the Owens Valley Paiute, whose crops were being destroyed. The Owens Valley Indian War of 1861–1863 ensued; at the end, the Owens Valley Paiute, along with other native peoples in the region, were forced at gunpoint by the United States Army to walk almost [...] to Fort Tejon, in one of the many forced relocations or [...] "Trails of Tears" [...] inflicted upon Native Americans in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Berger's SS-HA had a {{problematic}} {{relationship with the}} SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. The SS-FHA wanted the Waffen-SS {{to be a small}} elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and even mail. Berger's well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the Reichsführer-SS soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the Waffen-SS. Berger's criticisms of Jüttner must be seen {{in the light of the}} advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner's position with Himmler was weakened.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} death, the Viscount of Inhaúma {{was hailed as}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} figures of the Brazilian armada" [...] in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called [...] "Uncle Joaquim" [...] by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, [...] "andar na Inácia", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, [...] "is, and always will be, important to the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The Inhaúma-class corvette, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him. Despite the <b>scant</b> <b>attention</b> paid him in historical literature, there are some historians who share a highly positive view of Inhaúma.
