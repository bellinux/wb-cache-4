5|$|By February 2014, {{all four}} major U.S. TV {{networks}} {{had signed up}} to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform {{in the form of}} in-tweet real-time video clips. In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Twitter Amplify and Twitter introduced one-tap video playback across its mobile apps to further enhance the consumer experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} {{trend in the}} number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find skilled employment. Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a training allowance to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E
50|$|Countries {{can become}} {{a party to the}} 1960 (Hague) Act, the 1999 (Geneva) Act, or both. If a country <b>signs</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> only one Act, then {{applicants}} from that country can only use the Hague system to obtain protection for their designs in other countries which are <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the same Act. For instance, because the European Union has only <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1999 (Geneva) Act, applicants which qualify to use the Hague system because their domicile is in the European Union can only get protection in countries which have also <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1999 Act or to both the 1999 and 1960 Acts.|$|R
50|$|For {{countries}} not <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> any convention, {{letters rogatory}} are still used. So for example, a plaintiff in the Netherlands which is <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Hague Service Convention would {{still need to}} issue letters rogatory to Brazil, as the latter has not signed the Convention.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E
