40|$|Steers were sorted {{into four}} {{groups based on}} hip height and <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the start of}} the {{finishing}} period. Each group of sorted steers was fed diets containing 0. 59 or 0. 64 Mcal NEg per lb. of diet dry matter. Steers with less initial <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> (0. 08 in.) compared with those with more (0. 17) had less carcass <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> 103 days later. The steers with less <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> accumulated <b>fat</b> at a faster rate, but this was not apparent prior to 80 days. Accretion of fat was best predicted by an exponential growth equation, and was not affected by the two concentrations of energy fed in this study. Steers with greater initial height accumulated <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> at a slower rate than shorter steers. This difference was interpreted to mean that large-frame steers accumulate subcutaneous fat at a slower rate than medium-frame steers. Increase in area of the ribeye was best described by a linear equation. Initial <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> hip height, and concentrations of energy in the diet did not affect rate of growth of this muscle. Predicting carcass <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> from the initial ultrasound measurement of fat thickness found 46 of the 51 carcasses with less than 0. 4 in. of <b>fat</b> <b>cover.</b> Twelve carcasses predicted to have less than 0. 4 in. of <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> had more than 0. 4 in.

40|$|Yearling steers were sorted {{into four}} {{groups based on}} hip height and <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the start of}} the {{finishing}} period. Each group of sorted steers was fed diets containing 0. 59 or 0. 64 Mcal NEg per pound of diet. The value of each carcass was determined by use of the Oklahoma State University Boxed Beef Calculator. Sorting to increase hip height decreased the percentage of Choice carcasses and <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> increased ribeye area, and had no effect on carcass weight or yield grades 1 and 2. Sorting to decrease initial <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> decreased carcass weight, carcass <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> and percentage of choice carcasses and increased the proportion of yield grades 1 and 2 carcasses. Concentration of energy in the finishing diet had no effect on carcass measurements. Increasing the percentage of yield grades 1 and 2 carcasses did not result in increased economic value of the carcasses when quality grades were lower and when there was a wide spread between Choice and Select carcasses, as occurred in 1996. With less spread between Choice and Select, as in 1997, sorting the cattle to increase yield grades 1 and 2 resulted in increased value, especially for close-trim boxed beef.

40|$|The {{paper was}} {{designed}} to assess the influence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection status of cows at culling (antibody positive vs negative) on carcass traits: weight and conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> scores. A generalized least squares linear model {{was used to assess}} the influence of MAP on weight. Subsequently, a random effects logistic regression was completed in order to model the relation between MAP and conformation score (fair vs poor carcasses). A random effects ordered logistic model was used to estimate the influence on <b>fat</b> <b>cover.</b> The results indicated that seropositives had carcass weights 58. 45 (34. 65 - 83. 35) kg lower than seronegatives. Regarding conformation score, the odds of having poor conformation instead of fair was 3. 85 (1. 35 - 11. 85) times higher in seropositives. The odds of seropositives achieving a higher <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> was approximately 5 (1. 41 - 9. 09) times lower than the odds for seronegatives.

40|$|The review {{discusses}} the topics presented below, with experimental data and more evidence for some aspects which are problematic for the pig producer. To obtain high quality processed pig products, heavy pig production in Italy {{is subjected to}} rules fixed by several Consortia, {{on the basis of}} the experience of producers and the results from scientific research. Slaughter animals of at least 9 months of age and 160 kg live weight are required to provide heavy cuts with excellent meat. Breeds are limited to Italian Large White and Landrace, selected for specific parameters such as loss at 1 st salting of the ham, and their crosses. Crosses with Duroc and hybrids can be used if obtained from selection and crossing schemes that fit the objectives of Italian selection. Backfat thickness must be “sufficient” to obtain retailed fresh hams with <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> ranging from 20 to 30 mm, depending on ham weight, and the content of linoleic acid in ham <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> cannot exceed 15 %. Fat quantity and quality in feeds should be carefully controlled to satisfy the quality of fat in the ham. The feeding level is also relevant, due to the imposed minimum age at slaughter. Feed restriction is a necessary practice to respect the rules for ham production. For castrate males of medium genetic value, the restriction should reduce fat deposition, but the diet composition can be adapted to maintain the maximum growth of protein. For strains with high lean deposition potential and particularly for gilts, protein deposition should also be limited to maintain a sufficient <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> of ham...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Beef carcass {{conformation}} and <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> {{scores are}} measured by subjective grading performed by trained technicians. The discrete {{nature of these}} scores is {{taken into account in}} genetic evaluations using a threshold model, which assumes an underlying continuous distribution called liability that can be modelled by different methods. Methods Five threshold models were compared in this study: three threshold linear models, one including slaughterhouse and sex effects, along with other systematic effects, with homogeneous thresholds and two extensions with heterogeneous thresholds that vary across slaughterhouses and across slaughterhouse and sex and a generalised linear model with reverse extreme value errors. For this last model, the underlying variable followed a Weibull distribution and was both a log-linear model and a grouped data model. The fifth model was an extension of grouped data models with score-dependent effects in order to allow for heterogeneous thresholds that vary across slaughterhouse and sex. Goodness-of-fit of these models was tested using the bootstrap methodology. Field data included 2, 539 carcasses of the Bruna dels Pirineus beef cattle breed. Results Differences in carcass conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>cover</b> scores among slaughterhouses could not be totally captured by a systematic slaughterhouse effect, as fitted in the threshold linear model with homogeneous thresholds, and different thresholds per slaughterhouse were estimated using a slaughterhouse-specific threshold model. This model fixed most of the deficiencies when stratification by slaughterhouse was done, but it still failed to correctly fit frequencies stratified by sex, especially for <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> as 5 of the 8 current percentages were not included within the bootstrap interval. This indicates that scoring varied with sex and a specific sex per slaughterhouse threshold linear model should be used in order to guarantee the goodness-of-fit of the genetic evaluation model. This was also observed in grouped data models that avoided fitting deficiencies when slaughterhouse and sex effects were score-dependent. Conclusions Both threshold linear models and grouped data models can guarantee the goodness-of-fit of the genetic evaluation for carcass conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> but our results highlight the need for specific thresholds by sex and slaughterhouse in order to avoid fitting deficiencies. </p...|$|R
