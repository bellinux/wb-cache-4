40|$|The act of {{accessing}} data {{objects in}} a persistent store {{may result in}} the creation of state dependencies between the accessing processes and data objects. It is important for the logical integrity of the store that checkpoint or roll-back of all dependent entities (processes or objects) occurs as an atomic action. Reducing the number of dependent entities in the system leads to shortening of the period of <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> during checkpoint and roll-back operations and thus improvement in system efficiency. In this paper we investigate a new approach to the representation of dependencies based on differentiating between dependencies created as a result of read accesses and of write accesses. Using directed graphs to maintain information about dependencies and separately defining the meaning of graph edges for checkpoint and roll-back operations, we show {{that it is possible to}} significantly reduce the cascade effects of these operations. ...|$|E

Many existing programs can benefit from this software to achieve transparence to disconnection and relocation. We conclude that persistent connection [...] ...|$|R

This dormancy phase was exhibited by an extended lag time needed to achieve full growth when inocula taken from cultures 11 and 12 days old. The lag time was found to be related to the loss of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, but not to the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although yawning is a {{ubiquitous}} and phylogenetically old phenomenon, {{its origin}} and purpose remain unclear. The study aimed at testing the widely held hypothesis that yawning is triggered by drowsiness and brings about a reversal or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> falling asleep. METHODS: Subjects complaining of excessive sleepiness were spontaneously yawning {{while trying to}} stay awake in a quiet and darkened room. Changes in their electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) associated with yawning were compared to changes associated with isolated voluntary body movements. Special care was taken to remove eye blink- and movement-artefacts from the recorded signals. RESULTS: Yawns were preceded and followed by a significantly greater delta activity in EEG than movements (p< or = 0. 008). After yawning, alpha rhythms were attenuated, decelerated, and shifted towards central brain regions (p< or = 0. 01), whereas after movements, they were attenuated and accelerated (p< 0. 02). A significant transient increase of HRV occurred after the onset of yawning and movements, which {{was followed by a}} significant slow decrease peaking 17 s after onset (p< 0. 0001). No difference in HRV changes was found between yawns and movements. CONCLUSIONS: Yawning occurred during periods with increased drowsiness and sleep pressure, but was not followed by a measurable increase of the arousal level of the brain. It was neither triggered nor followed by a specific autonomic activation. Our results therefore confirm that yawns occur due to sleepiness, but do not provide evidence for an arousing effect of yawning...|$|R
