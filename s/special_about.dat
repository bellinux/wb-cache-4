5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything <b>special</b> <b>about</b> it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting.

5|$|There's {{something}} <b>special</b> <b>about</b> {{that first}} single, {{we were never}} quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E

This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela).

5|$|Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, {{game show}} host, and comedian, {{best known for}} his {{character}} Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful <b>special</b> <b>about</b> it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade, Reubens would be completely committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was less successful than its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a <b>special</b> <b>about</b> where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
