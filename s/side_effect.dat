5|$|The major <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of {{warfarin}} use is bleeding. Risk {{of bleeding}} is increased if the INR {{is out of}} range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.|$|E

40|$|Sexual <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of {{psychiatric}} medications have been estimated {{to occur in}} 60 % of male clients (1) and 30 % of female clients (2). Despite a body of literature relating individual medications to specific sexual <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> few studies have satisfactorily addressed the psychotropic-induced sexual dysfunctions in women. The spectrum of known sexual <b>sided</b> <b>effects</b> resulting from psychopharmacologic interventionswill be reviewed. Guidelines for appropriately addressing the possibility of sexual <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> within a therapeutic relationship for maximizing reporting of sexual <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> and for possible treatment approaches to sexual <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> will be described...|$|R
25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} in itself painless. Many low-dose palliative {{treatments}} (for example, radiation therapy to bony metastases) cause minimal or no <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced {{in the days following}} treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> during treatment (acute <b>side</b> <b>effects),</b> in the months or years following treatment (long-term <b>side</b> <b>effects),</b> or after re-treatment (cumulative <b>side</b> <b>effects).</b> The nature, severity, and longevity of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.|$|R
5|$|Warfarin {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} until platelet count has improved or normalised. Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these thrombophilic conditions {{increase the risk of}} skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> associated with warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of Baldwin's tour of Wales was {{the implied}} {{assertion}} of royal authority {{in a section}} of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are {{predictable}} and expected. <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> from radiation are usually {{limited to the}} area of the patient's body that is under treatment. <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> are dose- dependent; for example higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with cardiovascular complications, thyroid dysfunction, and pituitary axis dysfunction. Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> that are unavoidable.|$|R
40|$|Human-computer {{interfaces}} often {{give rise}} to a variety of <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> including eyestrain, headache, fatigue, and motion sickness (aka cybersickness, simulator sickness). We might hope that improvements in interface design would tend to reduce these <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Unfortunately, history reveals just the opposite: The incidence and severity of motion sickness (for example) is positively related to the progressive sophistication of display technology and systems. In this presentation, I enquire about the future of interface technologies in relation to <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> I review the types of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> that occur and what is known about the causes of interface <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> I suggest new ways of understanding relations between interface technologies and <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> and new ways to approach the problem of interface <b>side</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|Immune {{checkpoint}} inhibitors (ICI) {{represent a}} new revolutionary {{weapon in the}} armamentarium of anti-cancer therapies. The <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of these new agents represent a new challenge for oncologists; they are usually unpredictable and sometimes life threatening, if not managed rapidly and adequately. The most frequent <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are the dermatologic, but they are usually low grade <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and consequently easily manageable. Rash, pruritus and vitiligo are the most frequent dermatologic <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> We aimed in this review to describe first all the dermatologic <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of ICI according to the subtype of ICI and combination therapies in the clinical trials, then to report all the rare case reports dermatologic <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> and finally to present the management algorithm of these <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

50|$|In a {{combination}} study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa, the incidence {{and severity of}} <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> was comparable to monotherapy. Encountered <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> required a termination of cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> were infrequent cases of hematological <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> and an occasional increase in liver enzymes or serum creatinine without signs or symptoms.|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{tolerability}} of antidepressants have improved considerably {{over the past}} two decades, Nevertheless, antidepressant <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are still common and problematic. The majority of patients treated with contemporary agents experience one or more bothersome <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> These <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> often create barriers to achieving depressive remission, as well as to preventing relapse and recurrence. Clinicians tend to underestimate the prevalence of <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> and as many as one quarter of patients discontinue their antidepressants because of difficult-to-tolerate side effects; others may continue on antidepressant therapy but experience diminished quality of life related to troublesome <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> This article reviews the prevalence of <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> the impact of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> on treatment adherence, and methodological issues including the challenge of distinguishing <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> from residual depressive symptoms, discontinuation effects, and general medical problems. In addition, we address the most common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> such as sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disturbance, apathy, and fatigue, and offer strategies for management that may help patients achieve optimal response to pharmacotherapy...|$|R
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{became the}} channel of {{communication}} between the NDRC and its counterparts in Britain and Canada. Through him, Laurence obtained an introduction to Lyman J. Briggs, {{the chairman of the}} NDRC's S-1 Uranium Committee, who supplied copies of American studies. On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through Lord Melchett for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research. This payment was made by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) through a Canadian subsidiary. It had the desired <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of impressing the Canadian authorities with the importance of Laurence's work.|$|E

Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as a <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the operation of the}} Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are droopy eyelids (ptosis) and over- or undercorrections; a further common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are {{diplopia}} and inadvertent vertical deviation (hypo- or hypertropia). The <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> typically resolve in 3-4 months.|$|R

Some recommendations about how to prevent and manage these <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are also provided. It is concluded that atypical antipsychotics do not represent a homogeneous class, and that differences in <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> {{should be taken into}} account by clinicians when choosing an antipsychotic for an individual patient...|$|R
40|$|<b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> {{are among}} the most {{frequent}} reasons preventing patients from taking their medication. Although the management of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> is an important issue in clinical practice, particularly in patients with physical comorbidities, research on clinical management of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> is rather scattered. The aim of this article was to provide an overview on the prevalence and management of various <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of mood-stabilizing drugs. In December 2012, we carried out a PubMed search for publications reporting <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> in patients with bipolar disorder. Naturalistic studies describing the prevalence of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> in treatment with mood stabilizers are sparse. We describe the prevalence of neurological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, thyroid, dermatological, nephrogenic, cognitive, sexual, hematological, hepatogenic, and teratogenic <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine and discuss their clinical management. There are specific strategies that aim at reducing <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> but, to date, studies on the efficacy of these interventions are lacking. With age, the renal elimination and hepatic metabolism of drugs reduce and comedication and somatic comorbidity increase, making elderly patients particularly susceptible to <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Most <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> can be managed by striving for the lowest possible dose without losing efficacy by lowering the dose below the therapeutic window. Specific measurements to limit certain <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are available and may ameliorate treatment adherence. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
