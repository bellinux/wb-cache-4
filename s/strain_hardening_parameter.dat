It was found that both Stage II and Stage III deformation occur and that the flow stress and <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter</b> for pure copper are independent of temperature during Stage II hardening. During Stage III hardening, both parameters decrease with temperature. The hardening characteristics of the alloy {{can be divided into}} two temperature regions separated by a critical temperature, Tcrit = 423 °K. At temperatures below Tcrit, the flow stress is proportional to temperature, T 1 3 and this effect has been attributed to elastic interaction between stationary tin atoms and moving dislocations. The <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter</b> {{has been found to be}} independent of temperature and to have a magnitude of 1. 5 times that of pure copper over a wide range of strain and temperature. An analysis of this phenomenon, in terms of the jog theory of hardening, predicts a dislocation density in the alloy 2. 6 times that in copper at the same plastic strain. At temperatures above Tcrit, the flow stress is proportional to temperature, T- 2, as predicted by an analysis of the interactions which take place between moving dislocations and moving solute atmospheres. The ductility of the alloy was found to vary in a complex manner as the testing temperature increased from 86 °K to 700 °K.

Shear testing is applied to obtain large plastic strains in sheet metals without strain localisation. In the experiments, full-field displacement measurements are carried out by means of digital image correlation, and based on these measurements the strain field of the deformed specimen is calculated. In the numerical analyses, an elastoplastic constitutive model with isotropic hardening and the Cockcroft- Latham fracture criterion is adopted to predict the observed behaviour. The <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters</b> are obtained from a standard uniaxial tensile test for small and moderate strains, while the shear test is {{used to determine the}} <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> for large <b>strains</b> and to calibrate the fracture criterion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study, {{by means of}} {{numerical}} simulation, planar elongational flow of concd., inertialess, non-Brownian rigid particle suspensions in a viscoelastic fluid. The simulation is 2 D and follows the approach presented in our previous work [G. D'Avino, P. L. Maffettone, M. A. Hulsen, G. W. M. Peters, A numerical method for simulating concd. rigid particle suspensions in an elongational flow using a fixed grid, J. Comput. Phys. 226 (2007) 688 - 711]. A small computational domain is obtained by considering a three-layer domain. The innermost part is used to calc. the suspension response, the outermost is used to set the elongational flow boundary conditions far from the particles, and an intermediate region is mandatory to allow the developing of viscoelastic stress fields around the particle before entering the innermost layer. This scheme allows to achieve steady state (in a statistical sense). A time-independent fixed grid is used to avoid difficulties due to deforming meshes and remeshing of the domain. A fictitious domain has been implemented in order to easily manage the rigid-body motion. The particles are described by their boundaries only (rigid-ring description) and the rigid-body motion is imposed through Lagrange multipliers. A DEVSS-G/SUPG finite element formulation is implemented, and the log-conformation representation of the constitutive equation is used {{in order to improve}} the numerical stability of the method. The suspending liq. is treated as a Giesekus fluid. The bulk properties are detd. by using an averaging procedure.

Initial fits of these two classical <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> equations are constructed based on experimental data from uni-axial tensile tests up to the point of diffuse necking.

The intercept at the unit value of the true strain obtains the K magnitude, while {{the slope of the}} line gives the n value. It is well known that the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters,</b> K and n, are of significant industrial attention. The magnitude of n maintains quantification of the capability to decelerate localization of the plastic deformation of the materials. Materials with a high magnitude of <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> exponent are selected for operations, which involve plastic deformation because the higher the magnitude of n, the greater is {{the rate at which the}} material <b>strain</b> <b>hardens</b> (Meyers and Chawla 1991; Akbarpour and Ekrami 2008). The value of K provides the strength level of material or the magnitude of required forces in plastic deformation (Akbarpour and Ekrami 2008; Hertzberg 1996). Moreover, the unique material strength properties, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS), are individually important to consider and control as they influence the behavior of structures during accident in airplanes (Marin 1962). Taken together as the UTS/YS ratio (known as the “strain hardening value” in European practice) and strength difference (UTS-YS), they indicate the ductility capacity of the structural components where they were used (Fridman 1975).

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} {{shakedown}} {{is applied to}} obtain an upper estimation of LCF lifetime of structures. A model of elastic viscoplastic material similar to the Perzyna one with isotropic strain hardening and isotropic damage is adopted. Assumptions: viscoplastic strain rate {{is proportional to the}} access of the yield function over zero; the rate of damage evolution is equal to a function of hardening and damage parameters with the coefficient of fluidity, as a factor of proportionality; damage process is coupled with the viscoplastic deformation process; the hardening parameter is equal to accumulated viscoplastic deformation. The yield surfaces form a family of self-similar surfaces with the diameter as the parameter. The shakedown condition of the Melan type is formulated relatively to the initial yield surface. Features of the stress path lead to an equation with min–max problem of the mathematical programming in the left side, which determines a safe value of the virtual residual stress. The equation provides an opportunity to compute the maximal value of the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter</b> possible under the prescribed loading program.

40|$|A unified {{bounding}} surface viscoplasticity model is developed {{to describe the}} stress-strain time-dependent behaviour of soils using the consistency viscoplastic theory. Unlike the overstress based models, the elasto-viscoplastic model proposed meets the consistency condition, and allows smooth transition from rate-independent elastoplasticity to rate-dependent viscoplasticity. In the model proposed, the yield function {{is defined as a}} function of strain and strain rate parameters. This means the yield surface can expand and shrink not only by hardening or softening effects but also by strain rate effects. Two solutions, i. e. analytical and numerical are proposed for the derivation of viscoplastic multiplier with relevant assumptions in order to obtain the relationship between stresses and viscoplastic strains. A non-associated flow rule is used to generalise application of the model to all types of soils. A new hardening parameter, namely the strain rate hardening parameter, is introduced to account the rate dependency in the model. This strain rate hardening parameter () is defined {{as a function of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter</b> (ℎ).

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{cessation}} of rifting at constant tectonic force is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} lithospheric rheology using a simple one-dimensional numerical model. The behaviour of the conventionally adopted constant force model re-examined in this study contradicts some general features in the development of sedimentary basins. <b>Strain</b> <b>hardening</b> is implemented to explain the contradictions, in which the viscosity of the mantle is a function of not only the strain rate and temperature but also the total strain. The roles of various <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters</b> in rifting dynamics are examined, including the strain required for the onset of <b>hardening,</b> the <b>strain</b> interval required for the completion of hardening and the factor controlling the increase in mantle viscosity. It is shown that a model with <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> can explain many characteristic features of sedimentary basin formation better than the conventional constant force model. There are a variety of ways in which rifting can be terminated by the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> model, depending on the initial lithospheric structure, magnitude of tectonic force and the hardening process. One possible <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> mechanism involves the switch from wet to dry rheology associated with decompressional melting, though the implemented <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> formula could be generally applicable to any hardening phenomenon and could therefore be physically interpreted as such. The results of this study also provide important insights into sedimentary basin subsidence in relation to rifting dynamics. The end of an initial rapid ("syn-rift" like) subsidence phase is not necessarily equivalent to the end of actual rifting as in the constant force model. The transition from initial rapid subsidence to long-term, more subdued ("post-rift" like), subsidence is actually marked by the onset of deceleration of rifting. Since significant extension still continues for some time thereafter, the subsequent long-term subsidence includes some mechanical effect of crustal thinning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{analysis of}} spherical indentation experiments through extensive finite element simulations involving the J 2 flow and the J 2 deformation plasticity theories both under finite and infinite deformations {{to gain a}} fundamental comprehension into {{the mechanics of the}} transition between elasto-plastic and fully-plastic contacts. A decrease in hardness with increasing penetration is found to be a manifestation of the differences in material pileup responses between the two plasticity theories, so that in contrast to prior investigations, a peak in hardness cannot be taken to mark onset of a so-called finite deformation fully-plastic regime. The accuracy of Tabor’s hardness relation is examined in detail in light of the simulations and a general relation is proposed through dimensional analysis to correlate hardness with the uniaxial mechanical properties for any arbitrary elasto-plastic or fully-plastic contact. Experiments are also performed in different groups of metallic materials and a methodology is proposed to extract yield strength ys and power-law <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter</b> n from a minimum of two hardness measurements performed at different penetration depths. Influence of pressure sensitivity in the extracted properties is then examined through the experimental results.

Along these lines, consistency is found between simulations with the flow theory of plasticity and the crystal plasticity model for fcc metals. Finally, the potential of spherical indentation to distinguish between single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropy is considered...|$|E
40|$|Pseudoelastic {{behaviour}} {{of three}} types of Ti–Ni shape memory alloys in a pseudoelastic state has been studied under conditions of maximum strain- and maximum stress-controlled cycling. Experimental results proved that residual deformation after unloading increases {{with the number of}} cycles; however, critical stress for the induction of martensite and the energy dissipated in one cycle decline during cycling. A higher critical stress for slip, and more intense cyclic dislocation hardening promoted by greater maximum deformation and greater maximum applied stresses, generally reduce the rate at which residual elongation grows with the number of cycles, and tend to stabilise the cyclic stress-elongation diagrams. The small magnitude of critical stress for slip in lownickel alloys, and also cyclic <b>strain</b> <b>hardening,</b> induce greater internal stresses and a more marked decrease in critical stress for the induction of martensite as cycling progresses. Detailed analysis of plastic deformation propagation in cyclically loaded specimen helped develop a model of dependence of residual elongation on the number of cycles. This model enables identification of three main factors that govern the magnitude of residual elongation: one residual plastic elongation caused by dislocation hardening after the alloy is heat treated, and two cyclic <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters</b> describing how residual elongation grows with number of cycles, and how this residual elongation is reduced, as cycles increase, by the rising critical stress level for slip.

Grade 430 has a significantly higher yield strength, lower <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> rate and is more ductile and readily weldable {{when compared to the}} old Grade 380. This project was carried out to investigate the distribution of mechanical properties for NZS 3402 Grade 300, and the micro-alloyed Grade 430 reinforcing steel manufactured by Pacific Steel Ltd. The investigation was based on data supplied by Pacific Steel Ltd and on data generated from mechanical tests carried out in the Materials Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Canterbury. Tensile testing was carried out on the supplied material in the as rolled (deformed reinforcing bar) condition and on standard tensile specimens machined from these bars. One machined tensile specimen was pre-strained 5 % and artificially aged to determine a strain ageing index for each cast supplied. For both grades of steel distributions of lower yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, Luder strain at the yield point, <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters</b> n and k, and three parameters measuring strain ageing index were determined. The characteristic yield strength, minimum and maximum yield strength ranges obtained were found to comply with the specified tensile properties in the new specification.

The regression analysis yielded simple linear equations which can be used to predict the mechanical properties of bars from production variations in chemical composition.

40|$|Constitutive {{models that}} conform to {{separable}} KBKZ specification {{have been shown}} to fit steady-state <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> rheological data in planar and uniaxial elongational flows, but with inaccuracy in the rate of <b>strain</b> <b>hardening.</b> The single <b>parameter</b> Molecular Stress Function model of Wagner [Rheol. Acta, 39 (2000), 97 - 109] has been shown to accurately fit the rise-rate in experimental data for a number of <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> and <b>strain</b> softening materials. We study this models accuracy against the well characterised IUPAC LDPE data, and present a method for full implementation of this model for flow solution which is suitable for incorporating into existing separable KBKZ software. A new method for particle tracking in arbitrarily aligned meshes, which is efficient and robust, is given. The Quadratic Molecular Stress Function (QMSF) model is compared to existing separable KBKZ based models, including one which is capable of giving planar strain hardening; the QMSF is shown to fit experimental rheological and contraction flow data more convincingly. The issue of `negative correction pressures¿ notable in some Doi-Edwards based models is addressed. The cause is identified, and leads to a logical method of calculation which does not give these anomalous results...|$|R
40|$|Societal {{pressures}} are mounting on electricity operators to operate traditional fossil-fuel {{power plants in}} an efficient and flexible manner in conjunction with renewable power plants. This requires the uses of high frequency start up – shut down load profiles {{in order to better}} match market demands. As such, high temperature/pressure components such as steam pipe sections and headers experience fluctuating mechanical and thermal loads. There is therefore an industrial need for the accurate prediction of fatigue and creep damage in order to estimate remnant component life. In the present work, a continuum damage model has been coupled with a Chaboche unified viscoplastic constitutive model in order to predict stress-strain behaviour of a P 91 martensitic steel (a material used for power plant steam pipes) due to cyclic plasticity and damage accumulation. The experimental data used here are from the previous work [1]. Cyclic fully reversed strain controlled experiments (± 0. 4 %, ± 0. 25 % and ± 0. 2 % strain ranges) and cyclic test with a dwell period (± 0. 5 % strain ranges) for a P 91 martensitic steel under isothermal conditions (600 °C) are utilised. The physically relevant material parameters are determined and optimised using experimental results. Although many material parameter identification procedures {{can be found in the}} literature [1 - 6], there are uncertainties in determining the limits for the parameters used in the optimisation procedure. This could result in unrealistic parameters while optimising using experimental data. The issue is addressed here by using additional dwell test to identify the limits for stress relaxation parameters before using Cottrell’s stress partition method to identify the limits for <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters.</b> Accumulated stored energy for damage initiation criterion and damage evolution parameters are also extracted from the experimental results. The estimated failure lifetimes for ± 0. 4 %, ± 0. 25 % and ± 0. 2 % cases are 1600, 4250 and 9500 cycles, respectively, as opposed to 1424, 3522 and 10512 cycles as given by experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} goal of {{this study}} is to determine the effects of processing conditions, compositions and microstructural morphologies of the constituents on the physical and thermo-mechanical properties of alumina (Al_ 2 O_ 3) reinforced aluminum (Al) composites. Composites with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 25 vol% Al_ 2 O_ 3 were manufactured using powder metallurgy method. The elastic properties (Young's and shear modulus) and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites were determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and Thermo Mechanical Analyzer (TMA) respectively at various temperatures. Increasing compacting pressure improved relative density (or lowered porosity) of the composites. Furthermore, increasing the Al_ 2 O_ 3 vol% in the composite increased the elastic moduli and reduced the CTE of the composites. Increasing the testing temperature from 25 to 450 oC, significantly reduced the elastic moduli of the composites, while the CTE of the composites changed only slightly with temperatures. Secondly, the {{goal of this}} study is to determine the effect of microstructures on the effective thermo-mechanical properties of the manufactured Al-Al_ 2 O_ 3 composites using finite element (FE) method. Software OOF was used to convert the SEM micrographs of the manufactured composites to FE meshed models, which were then used to determine the effective elastic modulus and CTE. It was observed that, effective modulus dropped by 19. 7 % when porosity increased by 2. 3 %; while the effective CTE was mildly affected by the porosity. Additionally, the effect of residual stress on the effective thermo-mechanical properties was studied, and the stress free temperature of the composites was determined. Another objective {{of this study is}} to examine the stress-strain response of Al-Al_ 2 O_ 3 composites due to compressive loads at various temperatures. Elastic modulus, yield stress and <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined from the stress-strain curves and their dependency on temperature, porosity and volume fraction were studied. The experimental results were compared with the numerical results. It was observed that high-localized stresses were present near the pores and at the interfaces between Al and Al_ 2 O_ 3 constituents. Finally, functionally graded materials (FGMs) with varying Al_ 2 O_ 3 concentration (0, 5 and 10 vol%) in Al were manufactured; and their stress-strain response and CTE were determined at various temperatures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of the dilation characteristics of concrete in compression. Triaxial stress states, which are usually activated by prevention of dilation, often govern the load resistance of concrete structures. Therefore, a realistic description of the dilation characteristics of concrete is important. The influence of the dilation characteristics of concrete on the behaviour of actively and passively confined structures was studied. A plasticity approach proposed by Grassl et al. (Int. J. Solid Struct. 39 (2002) 5205) was used to study representative examples of concrete cylinders confined with steel and carbon fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP). The plasticity model used combines an isotropic hardening law, based on the plastic volumetric <b>strain</b> as <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter,</b> with a non-associated flow rule and a yield surface based on a three-parameter failure criterion proposed by Menétrey and Willam (ACI Struct. J. 92 (1995) 311). It is shown that the plasticity model proposed is capable of predicting the response of both steel- and CFRP-confined cylinders. In the case of steel-confined cylinders, the yield strength of the confining steel is reached so early that the dilation has only a small influence. However, the dilation characteristics of concrete have a strong influence on the axial stress–strain response of the CFRP-confined cylinders...|$|R
40|$|In a z-blade mixer, both shear and extensional {{deformations}} {{contribute to}} the development of dough structure. I effect of simple shearing versus z-blade mixing at similar levels of work input, on the microstructure and uniaxial extensional properties of two doughs prepared from flours of different strengths. With respect to microstructure, mixing initially increased the formation of coarse protein patches, leading to a heterogeneous dough structure with a high fracture stress (¿max) and significant <b>strain</b> <b>hardening.</b> These <b>parameters</b> decreased with prolonged mixing. This was accompanied by loss of glutenin macro polymer (GMP) wet weight and formation of a more homogenous microstructure. Prolonged mixing typically led to an over-mixed state. In contrast, prolonged simple shearing did not affect GMP content or <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> and gave enhanced shear banding. Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that short-term simple shearing induced structure formation in the direction of the shear flow for both flour types, followed by formation of shear-banded gluten structures both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of shear flow. Uniaxial extension of dough oriented parallel or perpendicular to the shear field did not reveal anisotropy. Apparently, the observed heterogeneity on a scale of 'mm' was not relevant for this type of rheology. Nevertheless, a relative weakening of dough strength (reduced fracture stress) was observed as a function of long-term shearing. This seems to be related to a local segregation effect caused by differences in visco-elasticity between the gluten phase and the starch granules. The results of this study reveal important features of the dough processing and underline the importance of not only work input, but also the type of deformation applied...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{boundary}} value problem corresponding to a model of strain gradient plasticity due to [Gurtin, M., Anand, L., 2005. A theory of strain gradient plasticity for isotropic, plastically irrotational materials. Part I: Small deformations. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 53, 1624 – 1649] is formulated as a variational inequality, and analysed. The formulation is a primal one, in that the unknown variables are the displacement, plastic <b>strain,</b> and the <b>hardening</b> <b>parameter.</b> The focus of the analysis is on those properties of the problem that would ensure existence of a unique solution. It is shown {{that this is the}} case when hardening takes place. A similar property does not hold for the case of softening. The model is therefore extended by adding to it terms involving the divergence of plastic strain. For this extended model the desired property of coercivity holds, albeit only on the boundary of the set of admissible functions...|$|R

The numerical approach for the creep behaviour is not restricted to a single creep law (e. g. <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> model) with <b>parameters</b> evaluated from a limited stress and temperature range. Instead of this strain rate - strain relations can be read from external creep data files for different temperature and stress levels. The damage module accumulates a damage measure based on the creep strain increment and plastic strain increment of the load step and the current fracture strains for creep and plasticity (depending on temperature and stress level). If the damage measure of an element exceeds a critical value this element is deactivated. Examples are given for illustration and verification of the new program modules. (orig.) 9 refs.
