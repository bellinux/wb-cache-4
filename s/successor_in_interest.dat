25|$|Prior to 1995, Microsoft {{licensed}} MS-DOS (and Windows) {{to computer}} manufacturers under {{three types of}} agreement: per-processor (a fee for each system the company sold), per-system (a fee for each system of a particular model), or per-copy (a fee for each copy of MS-DOS installed). The largest manufacturers used the per-processor arrangement, which had the lowest fee. This arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system, such as DR DOS. In 1991, the U.S. government Federal Trade Commission began investigating Microsoft's licensing procedures, resulting in a 1994 settlement agreement limiting Microsoft to per-copy licensing. Digital Research did not gain by this settlement, and years later its <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>interest,</b> Caldera, sued Microsoft for damages in the Caldera v. Microsoft lawsuit. It was believed that the settlement ran {{in the order of}} $150million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280million.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Frank Munsey had {{converted}} his juvenile magazine The Argosy into {{a fiction}} magazine for adults, {{the first of}} the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off. In 1910 Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, New Tip Top Weekly and Top Notch Magazine, into pulps; in 1915, Nick Carter Stories, itself a replacement for the New Nick Carter Weekly, became Detective Story Magazine, and in 1919, New Buffalo Bill Weekly became Western Story Magazine. Harry Wolff, the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune and Wild West Weekly. These two series were purchased by Street & Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.|$|E

First, the trust can only last as long as the lifetime of the animal (or the last surviving animal in a group) {{or in the case of}} a cemetery trust, no more than 21 years. [...] Also, the trust's corpus can only be applied to the intended use of caring for the animal or the cemetery plot.
