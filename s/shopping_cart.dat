Tom fires at it and his son runs away. A Mech is alerted and comes after Tom. Hal stops it by firing at it. It then runs after Hal. Tom puts C-4 in a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> and wheels it next to the Mech, killing it. The Skitter comes after Tom, but Dai shoots it. The alien dies slowly after its gun wound and the group observes it before it dies.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2004, <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> were {{identified}} {{as a source of}} pathogens and became a major public health concern. This was primarily due to the media spotlight on a Japanese research study revealing large amounts of bacteria on <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b> Those findings were later backed by a University of Arizona study in 2007. Now sanitary wipes, for cleaning hands and <b>shopping</b> <b>carts,</b> are seen near the entrances of most retailers.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, Bessie DeCamp {{invented a}} seat belt for chairs, go-carts or carriages. This was well before <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> with child seating areas were invented.

5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E
25|$|A <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> is a {{metal or}} plastic basket on wheels {{supplied}} by a shop, especially a supermarket, {{for use by}} customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.|$|E

25|$|McCarty {{never owned}} a car; she walked {{everywhere}} she went, pushing a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> nearly {{a mile to}} get groceries. She rode with friends to attend services at the Friendship Baptist Church. She did not subscribe to any newspaper and considered the expense an extravagance. Similarly, although she owned a black-and white-television, she received only broadcast transmissions. In 1947, her uncle gave her the house in which she lived until her death. She also received some money from her aunt and mother when they died, which she placed into savings as well.|$|E
25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{which oversees}} the {{regulation}} of antimicrobial agents and materials in that country, found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. Copper and copper alloys are unique classes of solid materials as no other solid touch surfaces have permission in the U.S. to make human health claims (EPA public health registrations were previously restricted only to liquid and gaseous products). The EPA has granted antimicrobial registration status to 355 different copper alloy compositions. In healthcare applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, intravenous poles, computer keyboards, etc. In public facility applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include health club equipment, elevator equipment, <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> handles, etc. In residential building applications, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include kitchen surfaces, bedrails, footboards, door push plates, towel bars, toilet hardware, wall tiles, etc. In mass transit facilities, EPA-approved antimicrobial copper products include handrails, stair rails grab bars, chairs, benches, etc. A comprehensive list of copper alloy surface products that have been granted antimicrobial registration status with public health claims by the EPA can be found here: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> and {{spraying}} canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} teenagers, led by [...] "Sky Commander Winky" [...] (Aaron Paul), film {{one of their}} friends, nicknamed [...] "Cap'n Dare" [...] (played by Branden Williams), doing stunts for a cable TV show called Dumbass. The last stunt {{involves}} a ramp-jump in a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> During the stunt, Dare veers off and falls out of the cart and is found dead after part of his skull collapses. The local coroner calls in John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to investigate the death. During the autopsy, flies erupt from Dare's eye sockets. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examines the body and finds that the insects had fed on Dare's brain {{to such a degree}} that it simply collapsed.|$|E

However, they begin arguing in a car. The video then shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. They eventually begin to physically abuse one another. During the final chorus, Rihanna is seen vomiting streamers; she is also seen unconscious on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. After [...] finding the boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, Rihanna decides she has had enough of the relationship and leaves him.

500|$|Silent Hill 2 also {{incorporates}} some {{references to}} real-life events. In the original scenario, the developers designed Maria and James with dual personalities: Maria's other personality was [...] "Mary", {{a reference to}} Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last victim, while James' was [...] "Joseph", a reference {{to one of the}} Jack the Ripper suspects. Eddie Dombrowski's name was taken from actor Eddie Murphy during the beginning phases of production when Eddie was originally designed with a pleasantly optimistic personality. The name of Angela Orosco was derived from Angela Bennett, the name of the protagonist in the 1995 film The Net, and Laura's from the 1970 novel No Language But a Cry by Richard D'Ambrosio. The developers satirized guns in American society by allowing James to find a handgun in a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> There are also indications that the layout of Silent Hill was based to a certain extent on the town of San Bruno, California.|$|E
500|$|While his {{performance}} of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] was {{a tradition of}} his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, [...] "It's not the time or place to do it," [...] {{even though it was}} the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times {{as a result of the}} frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it." ...|$|E
500|$|Copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} have natural {{properties that}} destroy {{a wide range}} of microorganisms (e.g., E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, Clostridium difficile, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi). Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as [...] "antimicrobial materials with public health benefits"; that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, computer keyboards, health club equipment, and <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> handles (for a comprehensive list, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and Legionnaires' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.|$|E
