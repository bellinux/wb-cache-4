Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Another component for evaluation is pipelines for transporting liquid or gas materials. Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation.

25|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mathematical}} models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of <b>system</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model {{is a set of}} meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships {{can be as simple as}} adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation. Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.|$|E

30|$|The Simplified Express Consignment Clearance System (the SECCS) for aircargo was {{introduced}} in Taoyuan Airport, Taiwan, in 2001 to provide an efficient consignment clearance service for express aircargo operators. This system has booted efficiency by streamlining the declaration procedures. However, the Customs Administration (CA), customs officers, customs brokers, and consignees disagree as regards {{the effectiveness of the}} SECCS. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system, this study examines the SECCS operations in detail and identifies the critical influencing factors. Suggestions based on the findings are then offered to strengthen the <b>system’s</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> The research scope is expanded to cover the development and structure of the SECCS. This paper makes several contributions. First, this paper examines the CA’s development of the express consignment clearance system. Second, this paper analyzes the consignment clearance <b>system’s</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and identifies critical factors.

5000|$|When {{objectives}} {{are not limited}} to quantitative output, the measurement of <b>system</b> <b>effectiveness</b> is difficult to make and subsequently perplexing to evaluate. Many of the characteristics pertaining to output do not lend themselves to quantitative measurement. This is true particularly when inputs of human energy cannot be related directly to output. The same situation applies to machines and other equipment associated with human involvement, when output is not in specific units. In evaluating man-machine or human-oriented systems, psychological and sociological factors obviously do not easily translate into quantifiable terms. For example, how does mental fatigue affect the quality or quantity of output? And, if it does, is mental fatigue a function of the lack of a challenging assignment or the fear of a potential injury? ...|$|E

30|$|Import express cargo {{clearance}} {{records were}} collected and {{logistic regression analysis}} was performed to identify critical factors that influence the <b>system’s</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Results reveal the “inspector” {{to be the most}} significant factor. Having a diligent inspector will result in a high number of customs declarations that should be charged for duties or taxes with penalty. This finding questions the notion that the inspector is indeed the most significant factor. Thus, the scope of this study was expanded to cover the simplified system’s policy and structure, and concerned parties were interviewed to gain an in-depth understanding. Findings reveal that the system flaw originates from the inability of the simplified system to perform its designated function. This paper offers several contributions to the literature. First, this paper examines the CA’s development of the simplified clearance system. Second, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the consignment clearance <b>system’s</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and its critical influencing factors.

50|$|Traffic {{simulation}} models are useful from a microscopic, macroscopic and sometimes mesoscopic perspectives. Simulation {{can be applied}} to both transportation planning and to transportation design and operations. In transportation planning the {{simulation models}} evaluate the impacts of regional urban development patterns on the performance of the transportation infrastructure. Regional planning organizations use these models to evaluate what-if scenarios in the region, such as air quality to help develop land use policies that lead to more sustainable travel. On the other hand, modeling of transportation system operations and design focus on a smaller scale, such as a highway corridor and pinch-points. Lane types, signal timing and other traffic related questions are investigated to improve local <b>system</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and efficiency. While certain simulation models are specialized to model either operations or system planning, certain models have the capability to model both to some degree.|$|E
