40|$|Isostructural solvates of the 1 : 1 {{molecular}} complex between the antibacterial drugs tetroxoprim (TXP) and <b>sulfametrole</b> (SMTR) with formulae TXP. SMTR. CH 3 OH (I), TXP. SMTR. C 2 H 5 OH (II) and TXP. SMTR. H 2 O (III), were investigated {{to establish their}} propensity for guest exchange. Separate exposure of powdered (I), (II) and (III) to a saturated atmosphere of each solvent of the complementary solvate pair at ambient temperature resulted in reversible solvent exchange in all cases. DSC and TG were the methods of choice for monitoring the exchange processes since (I) -(III) have distinct onset temperatures of desolvation and characteristic mass losses. Interpretation of the results {{in terms of the}} known locations of the solvent molecules in crystals of (I) -(III) led to the conclusion that solvent exchange probably proceeds by a co-operative mechanism involving material transport through channels while the common host framework is maintained...|$|E
40|$|Cosoltrim (CTM) is {{the generic}} name {{suggested}} {{for the new}} combination of <b>sulfametrole</b> (SMT) (3 -methoxy- 44 (4 amino-benzene-sulfonamide) - 1, 2, 5 -thiodazoleeee) with trimethoprim (TMP) in the 1 : 5 ratio (LIDAPRIM Farmades S. p. A. Roma, Italy). We have studied the antibacterial activity in vitro of SMT-CTM and of cotrimoxazole (CTZ) as a standard drug, on 99 strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which have been recently isolated from hospitalized patients. We also have carried out an in vivo study, by comparing the antibacterial activity(PD 50) in mice of CMT with that of CTZ: In vitro, the CTM antibacterial activity appears slightly superior to that of CTZ on E. coli, and Propeus spp. and Providencia spp. :The study on the in vivo activity {{has been carried out}} by infecting mice with: Proteus mirabilis CH/ 1, Salmonella parathyphi.

40|$|International audienceEmergence of {{resistance}} to widely used trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as well as common adverse events in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients casts interest on combinations of TMP with other sulfonamides. <b>Sulfametrole</b> (SMT) combined with TMP could provide a choice for difficult-to-treat infections, particularly when administered intravenously. The objective of this review was to evaluate the available clinical and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) evidence regarding TMP/SMT, particularly in comparison with TMP/SMX. We reviewed the available evidence retrieved from searches in PubMed/Scopus/Google Scholar and by bibliography hand-searching. In total, 46 eligible studies (most published before 1997) were identified, 7 regarding intravenous (i. v.) TMP/SMT, 24 regarding oral TMP/SMT and 15 providing comparative data for TMP/SMT versus TMP/SMX. The antimicrobial activity of TMP/SMT was similar to TMP/SMX for Gram-positive isolates, and {{a greater percentage of}} and spp. were susceptible to TMP/SMT compared with TMP/SMX. PK/PD data suggest a dosage adjustment of i. v. TMP/SMT in patients with seriously impaired renal function. Four randomised controlled trials and 16 non-comparative studies reported good effectiveness/safety outcomes for oral TMP/SMT in genital ulcers (mainly chancroid), respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Moreover, i. v. TMP/SMT was effective against infection in HIV-infected patients, severe pneumonia and UTIs. In one study, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 18 / 52 (34. 6 %) of HIV-infected patients; 2 / 52 (3. 8 %) developed psychosis. Gastrointestinal adverse events were mild and rare. The excipients in i. v. TMP/SMT formulations might be less toxic compared with i. v. TMP/SMX formulations, particularly for children. In conclusion, despite the scarcity of contemporary evidence, available data suggest that TMP/SMT could be an alternative treatment option to TMP/SMX, even in serious infections, when administered intravenously...|$|E
