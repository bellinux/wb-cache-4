50|$|The major {{objective}} of CETSOL {{is to improve}} and validate the modelling of Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET) and of the grain microstructure in solidification processing. This aims to give industry confidence in {{the reliability of the}} numerical tools introduced in their integrated numerical models of casting, and their relationship. To achieve this goal, intensive deepening of the quantitative characterization of the basic physical phenomena that, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scales, govern microstructureformation and CET will be pursued.CET occurs during columnar growth when new grains grow ahead of the columnar front in the undercooled liquid. Under certain conditions, these grains can stop the columnar growth and then the <b>solidification</b> <b>microstructure</b> becomes equiaxed. Experiments have to take place on the ISS due to the long-duration required to solidify samples with the objective to study the CET. Indeed, the length scale of the grain structure when columnar growth takes place is of the order of the casting scale rather than the microstructure scale. This {{is due to the fact}} that, to a first approximation, it is the heat flow that controls the transition rather than the solute flow. Experimental programs are being carried out on aluminium-nickel and aluminium-silicon alloys.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of an object}} with a moving solidification front is a common feature of many industrial and natural processes such as metal processing, the growth of single-crystals for photovoltaics and microelectronics, the cryo-preservation of cells, the formation of sea ice, or the preparation of frozen food. Solidification fronts interact with objects with different outcomes, from the total rejection to the complete engulfment of objects. Being able to understand and control the <b>solidification</b> dynamics and <b>microstructure</b> is of primary importance in these domains. However, because of the typical space and time-scale, it is still fundamentally difficult to track in situ the development of <b>solidification</b> <b>microstructures</b> where objects interact with a rapidly moving solid/liquid interface. Here we image the freezing of emulsions in 5 D (space, time, and solute concentration) with confocal microscopy and show that oil droplets interacting with the solidification front {{may be a good}} analogue of many solidification systems. Our results demonstrate the importance of the interaction dynamics on <b>solidification</b> <b>microstructures</b> and the critical role of solute-induced premelting. Instead of the widely used critical velocity for engulfment, we propose to use the object displacement by the front as a criterion to control <b>solidification</b> <b>microstructures.</b> We anticipate the approach to be useful to investigate a variety of solidification problems where the dynamics of interfaces and objects are an essential feature of the phenomenon to study.

Direct metal AM is used not only for prototyping, but to produce final production parts in the aerospace, medical, automotive and other industries. Process mapping is an approach that represents process outcomes in terms of process input variables. <b>Solidification</b> <b>microstructure</b> process maps are developed for single bead and thin wall deposits of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V via an electron beam wire feed and electron beam powder bed AM process. Process variable combinations yielding constant beta grain size and morphology are identified. Comparison with the process maps for melt pool geometry shows that by maintaining a constant melt pool cross sectional area, a constant grain size will also be achieved. Additionally, the grain morphology boundaries are similar to curves of constant melt pool aspect ratio.
