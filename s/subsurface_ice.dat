The Clementine mission in 1994 [Nozette et al., 1994] was the first to suggest the possible existence of <b>subsurface</b> water <b>ice</b> near the poles of the Moon. The Lunar Prospector neutron spectrometer data showed near-surface deposits enriched in hydrogen near both lunar poles under at least 40 cm of lunar regolith (with the assumed density of 2 g/cm 3 [Feldman et al., 1998]). Scientists estimated that as much as 6 billion metric tons of water ice may be buried in these craters under lunar soil, in more concentrated deposits than originally thought. However...|$|R

Rather than transporting hydrogen from Earth to use in making the methane and oxygen, they intend to mine the requisite water from <b>subsurface</b> water <b>ice</b> that is now known to be abundant {{across much of the}} Martian surface, produce and then store the post-Sabatier reactants, and then use it as propellant for return flights of their Interplanetary Spaceship no earlier than 2023.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Martian {{atmosphere}} vary significantly. As carbon dioxide sublimes back into the atmosphere during the Martian summer, it leaves traces of water. Seasonal winds sweep off the poles at speeds approaching 400 km/h and transport large amounts of dust and water vapor giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. These clouds of water-ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004.

50|$|The {{loss of the}} Martian {{magnetic}} field strongly affected surface environments through atmospheric loss and increased radiation; this change significantly degraded surface habitability. When there was a {{magnetic field}}, the atmosphere would have been protected from erosion by solar wind, which would ensure {{the maintenance of a}} dense atmosphere, necessary for liquid water to exist on the surface of Mars. The loss of the atmosphere was accompanied by decreasing temperatures. A part of the liquid water inventory sublimed and was transported to the poles, while the rest becametrapped in a <b>subsurface</b> <b>ice</b> layer.|$|E
40|$|Methane {{has been}} {{observed}} in the atmosphere of Mars {{by a number of}} different teams [1], although its presence is contentious and requires further confirmation. The detection has raised considerable interest since the presence of methane in a heavily oxidised environment could point to a biological source. However, there are other abiogenic processes such as volcanism [2], serpentinisation of minerals [3] in the crust or the dissociation of clathrate hydrates [4] that could be responsible for any methane that is observed. Here we discuss the nature of these processes and present details of simulation experiments designed to investigate the properties of release by them. By simulating interactions between surface regolith, <b>subsurface</b> <b>ices</b> and gases in the martian atmosphere in environmental chambers under martian conditions, the rate, relative likelihood and signatures of any release processes can be measured. Combining the results of these experiments with data from future missions such as the European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which aims to constrain the abundance and spatial/temporal variation of methane, will provide a much greater understanding of the methane cycle on Mars.

40|$|The {{prolific}} {{activity and}} {{presence of a}} plume on Saturn's tiny moon Enceladus offers us {{a unique opportunity to}} sample the interior composition of an icy satellite, and to look for interesting chemistry and possible signs of life. Based on studies of the potential habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa, icy satellite oceans can be habitable if they are chemically mixed with the overlying ice shell on Myr time scales. We hypothesize that Enceladusâ€™ plume, tectonic processes, and possible liquid water ocean may create a complete and sustainable geochemical cycle that may allow it to support life. We discuss evidence for surface/ocean material exchange on Enceladus based on the amounts of silicate dust material present in the Enceladusâ€™ plume particles. Microphysical cloud modeling of Enceladusâ€™ plume shows that the particles originate from a region of Enceladusâ€™ near surface where the temperature exceeds 190 K. This could be consistent with a shear-heating origin of Enceladusâ€™ tiger stripes, which would indicate extremely high temperatures (âˆ¼ 250 â€“ 273 K) in the subsurface shear fault zone, leading to the generation of subsurface liquid water, chemical equilibration between surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>ices,</b> and crustal recycling on a time scale of 1 to 5 Myr. Alternatively, if the tiger stripes form in a mid-ocean-ridge-type mechanism, a half-spreading rate of 1 m/year is consistent with the observed regional heat flux of 250 mW mâˆ’ 2 and recycling of south polar terrain crust on a 1 to 5 Myr time scale as well...|$|R

Perhaps the key argument that the bulk of the ice is water is that CO2 ice isn't mechanically strong enough to make a 3km thick ice cap stable over long periods of time.

50|$|The terrain at {{the eastern}} end of the Valles Marineris grades into dense jumbles of low rounded hills that seem to have formed by the {{collapse}} of upland surfaces to form broad, rubble-filled hollows.

The channels, which include Ares, Shalbatana, Simud, and Tiu Valles, are enormous by terrestrial standards, and the flows that formed them correspondingly immense.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>subsurface</b> water <b>ice</b> on Mars {{is a key}} constraint on past climate, while the volumetric concentration of buried ice (pore-filling versus excess) provides information about the process that led to its deposition. We investigate the subsurface of Arcadia Planitia by measuring the depth of terraces in simple impact craters and mapping a widespread subsurface reflection in radar sounding data. Assuming that the contrast in material strengths responsible for the terracing is the same dielectric interface that causes the radar reflection, we can combine these data to estimate the dielectric constant of the overlying material. We compare these results to a three-component dielectric mixing model to constrain composition.
