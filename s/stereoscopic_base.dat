40|$|After {{considering}} {{the growing demand}} for realistic video reproduction, in this thesis, we have proposed two stereoscopic video coding schemes that are evaluated for the suitability for 3 D mobile applications. One is an H. 264 <b>based</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> video codec {{and the other is}} a Distributed Video Coding (DVC) <b>based</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> codec. During {{the first half of the}} thesis, we propose an H. 264 <b>based</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> codec that includes a modification to handle two video streams in order to exploit disparity and worldline correlations as well as a design of a novel motion/disparity vector prediction algorithm that operates more intelligently using the previously coded motion and disparity vector information of the surrounding macroblocks. Simulation results show th~t the proposed H. 264 <b>based</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> video codec performs better than MPEG- 2 based and ZTE <b>based</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> codecs. The results have also been compared with simulcast H. 264 and later proposed MVC (Multiview Video Coding) standard. The former comparison demonstrates a PSNR gain of up to about 2 dB, whereas the latter demonstrates comparable results. In the second half of the thesis, we have designed several algorithms to improve the coding efficiency of Wyner-Ziv frames and a novel algorithm for key frame coding in DVC. These algorithms include a spatial and temporal correlation exploitation algorithm for side information generation, a multiple side information handling algorithm and a bitplane by bitplane refinement technique in addition to the mentioned DVC based key frame coding scheme. In the proposed algorithms, we exploit the decoded information very efficiently by taking the advantage of decoded information together with the information available in the decoder. Simulation results clearly show that these algorithms outperform the existing DVC codecs by significant margins. With these algorithms as the backbone, we have then introduced a novel Stereoscopic Distributed Video Coding (SDVC) scheme. Simulation results of the proposed SDVC algorithm demonstrate that it performs better than MPEG- 2 based and ZTE <b>based</b> benchmark <b>stereoscopic</b> codecs by up to 3 dB and 2 dB respectively in terms of objective quality gains. Enally this thesis, presents a W-CDMA channel simulation for both proposed stereoscopic codecs and the results suggest that, SDVC is a viable solution for stereoscopic video coding in mobile applications that comprises robust characteristics against channel noise together with the added advantage oflow encoding complexity.

40|$|AbstractThe slant of a stereoscopically defined surface {{cannot be}} {{determined}} solely from horizontal disparities or from derived quantities such as horizontal size ratio (HSR). There are four other signals that, {{in combination with}} horizontal disparity, could in principle allow an unambiguous estimate of slant: the vergence and version of the eyes, the vertical size ratio (VSR), and the horizontal gradient of VSR. Another useful signal is provided by perspective slant cues. The determination of perceived slant can be modeled as a weighted combination of three estimates based on those signals: a perspective estimate, a <b>stereoscopic</b> estimate <b>based</b> on HSR and VSR, and a <b>stereoscopic</b> estimate <b>based</b> on HSR and sensed eye position. In a series of experiments, we examined human observers’ use of the two stereoscopic means of estimation. Perspective cues were rendered uninformative. We found that VSR and sensed eye position are both used to interpret the measured horizontal disparities. When the two are placed in conflict, the visual system usually gives more weight to VSR. However, when VSR is made difficult to measure by using short stimuli or stimuli composed of vertical lines, the visual system relies on sensed eye position. A model in which the observer’s slant estimate is a weighted average of the slant estimate based on HSR and VSR and the one based on HSR and eye position accounted well for the data. The weights varied across viewing conditions because the informativeness of the signals they employ vary from one situation to another...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we exploit two {{characteristics}} of stereoscopic vision: the pop-out effect and the comfort zone. We propose a visual saliency prediction model for <b>stereoscopic</b> images <b>based</b> on stereo contrast and stereo focus models. The stereo contrast model measures stereo saliency {{based on the}} color/depth contrast and the pop-out effect. The stereo focus model describes the degree of focus based on monocular focus and the comfort zone. After obtaining {{the values of the}} stereo contrast and stereo focus models in parallel, an enhancement based on clustering is performed on both values. We then apply a multi-scale fusion to form the respective maps of the two models. Last, we use a Bayesian integration scheme to integrate the two maps (the stereo contrast and stereo focus maps) into the stereo saliency map. Experimental results on two eye-tracking databases show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.|$|R

40|$|Objective quality {{assessment}} of distorted stereoscopic images is a challenging problem. Existing {{studies suggest that}} simply averaging {{the quality of the}} left- and right-views well predicts the quality of symmetrically distorted stereoscopic images, but generates substan-tial prediction bias when applied to asymmetrically distorted stereo-scopic images. In this study, we first carry out a subjective test, where we find that the prediction bias could lean towards opposite directions, largely depending on the distortion types. We then de-velop an information-content and divisive normalization based pool-ing scheme that improves upon SSIM in estimating the quality of single view images. Finally, we propose a binocular rivalry in-spired model to predict the quality of <b>stereoscopic</b> images <b>based</b> on that of the single view images.
