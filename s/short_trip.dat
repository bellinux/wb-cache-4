5|$|A 7-Day <b>Short</b> <b>Trip</b> Pass for $38.50, {{valid for}} seven {{consecutive}} days for Metrorail trips costing up to $3.85 (the maximum off-peak fare) during peak fare times and any trip during off-peak hours. If the trip {{costs more than}} $3.60 the difference is deducted from the cash balance of a SmarTrip card, possibly after the necessary value is added at the Exitfare machine. A non-negative stored value is required to enter the Metrorail system.|$|E

Shakur was announced as one of six suspects in the ambushing of four policemen—two in Jamaica, Queens, and two in Brooklyn—on January 28, 1973.|$|E

5|$|The newly {{regenerated}} Eleventh Doctor crash-lands his TARDIS near young Amelia Pond's Leadworth home in 1996. The Doctor {{leaves the}} TARDIS to self-repair while Amelia helps him recover. She shows him {{a crack in}} her bedroom wall that he recognizes as a tear in space-time, leading to an Atraxi prison. The Atraxi alert him to the escape of Prisoner Zero.

5|$|In December 1921, {{they left}} the country {{and went to the}} Latvian capital city of Riga. The US {{commissioner}} in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> to Stockholm, they moved to Berlin for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper, the New York World. These were later collected and published in book form as My Disillusionment in Russia (1923) and My Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.|$|E

5|$|The {{course of}} the {{conflict}} took a radical turn when the central government charged Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count and later Duke of Caxias) with {{putting an end to}} the rebellion in late 1842. Marques de Sousa probably met him during Caxias' <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839 as part of the Minister of War's entourage. They subsequently maintained a friendly correspondence. Marques de Sousa was removed from his position over the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry and instead was given command of the 7th Brigade, which formed part of the 1st Division. The brigade consisted of his former 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry and a National Guard cavalry corps.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the Dominican Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the <b>short</b> <b>trip,</b> and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|On a <b>short</b> <b>trip,</b> Chidambaram {{reveals his}} {{identity}} to Vishwanathan's daughters, who agree to play along. Viswanathan, believing Ashok {{is the only}} heir of a millionaire, asks Kanchana's consent to marry him. When Kanchana rejects the proposal, Viswanathan asks Nirmala, who happily accepts. Sachidanandam, who is buying a nearby estate, is referred to Viswanathan and arrives in Chinnamalai. They meet and discover that they are childhood friends. Thinking {{it would be inappropriate}} to marry off his younger daughter while the elder one is still unmarried, Viswanathan arranges Kanchana's marriage to Vasu, who meets his father is unable to reveal his true identity to prevent getting caught. When Sachidanandam returns to Chennai to make the wedding preparations, he finds that there has been no word from his son, who left for Coimbatore weeks before.

5|$|Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar's dual {{proposal}} for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press {{they could no longer}} publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. Unfortunately, an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.|$|E
25|$|In June 1955 Andes {{made her}} first cruise. It was a {{relatively}} <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> of 4,600 miles {{to and from the}} Mediterranean. Thereafter her liner voyages to and from South America were often separated by cruises to either the Mediterranean or the Caribbean.|$|E

25|$|He {{returned}} to Sweden in 1779. But first {{he made a}} <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> to London and made the acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks. He saw there the Japanese collection from the 1680s of the German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651–1716), who had preceded him at Dejima. He also met Forster, who introduced him to his collections he had obtained during Cook's second voyage.|$|E
25|$|Tranmere Rovers {{made the}} <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> {{up the coast}} from the Wirral on 7 April.

Zola equalised {{for a second time}} one minute after the break, but Andy Morrell scored what proved to be the winner on 73 minutes. Rovers had John Mullin and Jason McAteer dismissed on 52 and 53 minutes, respectively.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} at Trinidad on 3 October, Biloxi conducted {{two weeks of}} battle drills and other exercises. These included radar calibration tests, night and day battle practice, fueling at sea exercises, and fighter (CAP) director drills. Departing Trinidad on the 18th, the light cruiser entered the Norfolk Navy Yard on 26 October for post-shakedown overhaul. Following these repairs, and a <b>short</b> <b>trip</b> north to Rockland, Maine, for gyro and compass standardization trials, Biloxi sailed south for the Canal Zone on 20 November.|$|E

25|$|Promotion was gained on an {{emotional}} night at Preston North End's Deepdale stadium in the West Lancashire derby, when a Fred Pickering hat-trick gave Blackpool a 3–0 victory. The capacity 34,000 attendance included some 20,000 Blackpool fans who had made that <b>short</b> <b>trip,</b> and their joy was enhanced {{by the fact that}} the result had placed their arch-rivals in even deeper trouble at the foot of the table; indeed, Preston were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history not long afterwards.|$|E
