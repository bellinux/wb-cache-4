5|$|Most of Rainilaiarivony's {{children}} {{failed to}} achieve their full potential. One son, Rafozehana, died young of delirium tremens, and sons Ratsimandresy and Ralaiarivony both met violent ends while still in their youth. Randravalahy, to whom Rainilaiarivony later ascribed the name Radilifera, was sent to France to study but returned before earning his diploma and faded into obscurity among the upper classes of Imerina. Ramangalahy studied medicine and {{was on his way}} to becoming a successful doctor, but died of illness in his twenties. Three brothers turned to crime: Rajoelina, who violated the laws of his country to enrich himself by selling contraband gold to an English company; Penoelina, who studied in England before health issues recalled him to Madagascar, where he and his friends engaged in sexual assault and theft; and Ramariavelo (Mariavelo), who organized a group of bandits to rob the houses of common citizens. One of Rainilaiarivony's daughters died in her twenties following a <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion,</b> and the rest married and lived quiet lives out of public view.|$|E
25|$|An induced {{abortion}} may {{be performed by}} a physician for women {{who do not want}} to continue the pregnancy. <b>Self-induced</b> <b>abortion</b> performed by a woman or non-medical personnel is extremely dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries. In some locales it is illegal or carries heavy social stigma.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} {{self-induced}} abortions in Brazil, where black market prices exceed US$100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised misoprostol abortions in Brazil {{are associated with a}} lower complication rate than other forms of illegal <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion,</b> but are still associated with a higher complication rate than legal, medically supervised surgical and medical abortions. Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases. Low-income and immigrant populations in New York City have also been observed to use self-administered misoprostol to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose). The drug is readily available in Mexico. Use of misoprostol has also increased in Texas in response to increased regulation of abortion providers.|$|E

50|$|Next {{comes the}} topic of birth control. Muscio tells {{the stories of the}} three abortions she has had during her lifetime: two {{clinical}} abortions and one <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion.</b> The clinical abortions are described as painful, impersonal experiences that are designed by men for women. <b>Self-induced</b> <b>abortion,</b> by means of abortive herbs, abdominal massages, and so forth, is advocated as being highly preferable to clinical abortions. Muscio also discusses how women's birth control methods can be upsetting and even physically harmful, and instead recommends condoms as a primary form of birth control.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of anecdotally {{recorded}} and disseminated methods of performing a <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion.</b> Many of the following methods present significant danger (see below) to the life or health of the woman: ...|$|E
50|$|Though {{women in}} Botswana are {{recognized}} as having {{some of the best}} access to abortions in Sub-Saharan Africa because of these exceptions, many women are still resorting to unsafe <b>abortions</b> and <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions,</b> commonly leading to maternal death.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to women}} {{practicing}} these medically {{safer and more}} cost-effective methods, the rate of <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions</b> was extremely high relative to other countries and regions. The side effects of using other methods {{have proved to be}} damaging to the mothers, resulting in high fevers, urinary tract infections, and genital trauma.|$|R
25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of war rape in Rwanda on its victims include social isolation (the social stigma attached to rape meant that some husbands left their wives who had become victims of war rape, or that the victims became unmarriageable), unwanted pregnancies and babies (some women resorted to <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions),</b> sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV/Aids (access to anti-retroviral drugs remains limited).|$|R
50|$|Misoprostol {{alone is}} {{sometimes}} used for <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion</b> in Latin American countries where legal abortion is not available, and by {{poor people in}} the United States for whom it is easier or cheaper than a legal abortion in a clinic.|$|E
50|$|Abortion in Tuvalu is only legal if the {{abortion}} {{will save the}} mother's life. If an abortion is performed on a woman for any other reason, the violator is subject to ten years in prison. A woman who performs a <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion</b> may be imprisoned for life.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion</b> by various means {{has long been}} recorded in the United States.

50|$|Shaver {{was tried}} for Johnson's death, {{as well as}} for the death of another {{abortion}} patient in 1916. Although she was a physician, the case rekindled a campaign against midwives, since journalists and politicians assumed that female physicians were midwives and that midwives provided abortions. Coverage exaggerated the idea that young girls were being killed by botched abortions from abortion providers, when in reality most deaths were from <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Powell {{was among}} the 7-2 {{majority}} who legalized abortion in the United States in Roe v. Wade. Powell's pro-choice stance on abortion stemmed from an incident during his Richmond law firm, when the girlfriend of one of Powell's office staff bled to death from an illegal <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

50|$|Minority {{women are}} likely {{of not knowing}} how to access information, health care, and family {{planning}} techniques that educate them with reproductive freedom. Due to the disproportionate presence of minority women, among poorer groups, depend on Federally funded health care. The restrictions on Medicaid funding abortion, has led to an increase of deaths and injuries from illegal or <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions.</b> These restrictions has incremented sterilization through 'bargaining'; that is, allowing a woman to have an abortion solely if she agrees to be sterilized.|$|R
25|$|Dr. Evelyn Fisher {{wrote of}} how {{women living in}} a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles {{intended}} for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix {{in an effort to}} <b>self-induce</b> <b>abortion.</b> Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930.|$|R
50|$|Using pills, catheters, {{injections}} and rods {{can kill}} {{a woman or}} injure her permanently. In addition to having only dangerous methods at their disposal, the women being tried for abortion were forced to <b>self-induce</b> <b>abortions</b> in their homes, in unsanitary conditions or in clandestine clinics that could not guarantee adequate procedures. If complications arise due to {{the conditions in which}} the abortion was practiced, they are then at risk of being reported by hospital staff who treat the complications. All of this highlights the risk to life, health, security of person and liberty that terminating an unwanted pregnancy represents for young, low-income women in El Salvador.|$|R

On March 17, 2016, another study conducted by TxPEP researchers was published in the American Journal of Public Health. found that after HB 2 became law and some abortion clinics closed, women whose nearest clinic closed traveled on average 85 miles each way, compared to 22 miles each way for women whose nearest clinic did not close, and that women whose clinics closed were also more likely to spend more time obtaining an abortion.|$|R
5000|$|Abortion is {{no longer}} a {{dangerous}} procedure. This applies not just to therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal abortions as done by physician. In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind, second, and even more important, the conference abortion sponsored by Planned Parenthood estimated that 90 percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians. Whatever trouble arises usually arises from <b>self-induced</b> <b>abortions,</b> which comprise approximately 8 percent, or with the very small percentage that go to some kind of non-medical abortionist. Abortion, whether therapeutic or illegal, is in the main no longer dangerous, because it is being done well by physicians.|$|R
