5|$|However, this <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely,</b> {{given that}} no one has ever {{documented}} that female euglossines produce pheromones; male euglossines produce pheromones using the chemicals they collect from orchids, and these pheromones attract females, rather than the converse, as Cullina (2004) suggests.|$|E
5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity {{is likely}} due to SEGA's desire to maintain Sonic's free and youthful nature, believing that committing to a relationship {{at this point in}} his life would simply be uncharacteristic of him.

5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have been political. Regardless, they {{confirmed}} a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under the bed to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the save file becomes. These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not be so easily patched.|$|E

5|$|The writer Frances Trollope, {{mother of}} novelist Anthony Trollope, rented {{a house on}} Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838, {{possibly}} Gladsmuir, shortly {{after the death of}} her husband and one of her sons. According to Robert Bradford's biography of Martin Amis, Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house's papers and maintained that Frances Trollope had purchased it, although a purchase <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> given the Trollope family's finances.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to diminish.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, {{it is also possible that}} Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp's {{ancestors}} {{originated in}} the village of Longchamps, Normandy, but he was born near the Norman village of Argenton. His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Hugh Nonant—one of Longchamp's opponents—declared that the elder Longchamp {{was the son of a}} peasant, which <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely,</b> as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight's tenancy in Normandy. The family was originally of humble background, but rose through service to King Henry II. The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England, including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales. Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the Lacy family. Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy, exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion.|$|E

5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely,</b> since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature was the cranial crest, which protruded {{from the rear}} of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely,</b> Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri, and more complex in P. tubicen, where some tubes were blind and others met and separated. While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature, P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E

50|$|However, as Souths had won {{the minor}} premiership by two points, the NSWRL play-offs system meant that Balmain had to beat them in the Final, and then beat them again in a second Final to claim the title. It <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, the vanguard of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. The vanguard fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of Alsace and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had been reluctant at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from Alsace. This reduced Roman forces in Alsace by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but it <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate {{a wide range of}} water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E
