40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{methods of}} {{randomization}} {{are available to}} create comparable intervention groups in a study. In the HOMERUS-trial, we compared the minimization procedure with a stratified and a non-stratified method of randomization {{in order to test}} which one is most appropriate for use in clinical hypertension trials. A second objective of this article was to describe the baseline characteristics of the HOMERUS-trial. METHODS: The HOMERUS population consisted of 459 mild-to-moderate hypertensive subjects (54 % males) {{with a mean age of}} 55 years. These patients were prospectively randomized with the minimization method to either the office pressure (OP) group, where antihypertensive treatment was based on office blood pressure (BP) values, or to the self-pressure (SP) group, where treatment was based on self-measured BP values. Minimization was compared with two other randomization methods, which were performed post-hoc: (i) non-stratified randomization with four permuted blocks, and (ii) <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization</b> with four permuted blocks and 16 strata. In addition, several factors that could influence outcome were investigated for their effect on BP by 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). RESULTS: Minimization and <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization</b> did not lead to significant differences in 24 -h ABPM values between the two treatment groups. Non-stratified randomization resulted in a significant difference in 24 -h diastolic ABPM between the groups. Factors that caused significant differences in 24 -h ABPM values were: region, centre of patient recruitment, age, gender, microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy and obesity. CONCLUSION: Minimization and <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization</b> are appropriate methods for use in clinical trials. Many outcome factors should be taken into account for their potential influence on BP levels. Recommendation. Due to the large number of potential outcome factors that can influence BP levels, minimization should be the preferred method for use in clinical hypertension trials, as it has the potential to randomize more outcome factors than <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization...</b>|$|E

Moreover, the theoretical bases of minimization methods remain largely elusive. In this paper, we propose a new covariate-adaptive design that is able to control various types of imbalances. We show that the joint process of within-stratum imbalances is a positive recurrent Markov chain under certain conditions. Therefore, this new procedure yields more balanced allocation. The advantages of the proposed procedure are also demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. Our work provides a theoretical tool for future research in this area.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} {{clinical}} trials of acupuncture {{is to help}} clinicians and patients make decisions about treatment. Yet this is not straightforward: some trials report acupuncture to be superior to sham (placebo) acupuncture while others show evidence that acupuncture is superior to usual care but not sham, and still others conclude that acupuncture is no better than usual care. Meta-analyses of these trials tend to come to somewhat indeterminate conclusions. This appears to be because, until recently, acupuncture research was dominated by small trials of questionable quality. The Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration, a group of trialists, statisticians and other researchers, was established to synthesize patient-level data from several recently published large, high-quality trials. Methods There are three distinct phases to the Acupuncture Trialists Collaboration: a systematic review to identify eligible studies; collation and harmonization of raw data; statistical analysis. To be eligible, trials must have unambiguous allocation concealment. Eligible pain conditions are osteoarthritis; chronic headache (tension or migraine headache); shoulder pain; and non-specific back or neck pain. Once received, patient-level data will undergo quality checks {{and the results of}} prior publications will be replicated. The primary analysis will be to determine the effect size of acupuncture. Each trial will be evaluated by analysis of covariance with the principal endpoint as the dependent variable and, as covariates, the baseline score for the principal endpoint and the variables used to <b>stratify</b> <b>randomization.</b> The effect size for acupuncture from each trial - that is, the coefficient and standard error from the analysis of covariance - will then be entered into a meta-analysis. We will compute effect sizes separately for comparisons of acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and acupuncture with no acupuncture control for each pain condition. Other analyses will investigate the impact of different sham techniques, styles of acupuncture or frequency and duration of treatment sessions. Discussion Individual patient data meta-analysis of high-quality trials will provide the most reliable basis for treatment decisions about acupuncture. Above all, however, we hope that our approach can {{serve as a model for}} future studies in acupuncture and other complementary therapies. </p...|$|R

Randomization methods assign, at random, treatment to the trial arms without foreknowledge of allocation by either the participants or the investigators thus reducing selection bias.

Methods/Design This cluster-randomized trial (conducted from June 2012 to June 2017), evaluates whether single-venue, integrated delivery of core HIV services to vulnerable high-risk populations improves service utilization and consequently, HIV testing and other outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Core services include: HIV counseling and testing, information, education and communication, condom distribution, needle and syringe exchange programs, opioid agonist therapy, management of sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and antiretroviral therapy. <b>Stratified</b> restricted <b>randomization</b> was used to allocate 22 Indian cities (10 {{men who have}} sex with men and 12 people who inject drugs sites) at a 1 : 1 ratio to either the intervention or control condition. Integrated care centers were scaled-up and implemented in the 11 intervention cities and outcomes will be assessed by pre- and post-intervention surveys at intervention and control sites. As {{men who have sex}} with men and people who inject drugs are hidden populations, with no sampling frame, respondent-driven sampling will be used to accrue samples for the two independent cross-sectional surveys.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a microprocessed phototherapy (PT) system with five high intensity light emitting diodes (Super LED) {{for the treatment of}} neonatal hyperbilirubinemia of premature infants. Methods: Randomized clinical trial using Super LED phototherapy in the study group and twin halogen spotlight phototherapy in the control group. A <b>stratified</b> blocked <b>randomization,</b> based on birth weight, was performed. The duration of phototherapy and the rate of decrease of total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentration in the first 24 hours of treatment were the main outcome measures. Results: We studied 88 infants, 44 in the Super LED group and 44 in the halogen spotlight PT group. The demographic characteristics of the patients in both groups were similar. Infants in the Super LED group had a similar mean initial serum bilirubin level (10. 1 ± 2. 4 mg%) to those receiving halogen spotlight treatment (10. 9 ± 2. 0 mg%). After 24 hours of treatment, the decrease in total serum bilirubin levels was significantly greater in the Super LED group (27. 9 vs. 10. 7 %, p< 0. 01) and duration of phototherapy was significantly shorter in this group (36. 8 h vs. 63. 8 h, p < 0. 01). After 24 hours of treatment, a significantly greater number of patients receiving Super LED phototherapy had reached serum bilirubin concentrations low enough to allow withdrawal of treatment (23 vs. 10, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the efficacy of Super LED phototherapy for treating hyperbilirubinemia in premature infants was significantly better than halogen phototherapy.

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the “Attitude of Secondary School Teachers towards Inclusive Education in Mysore District. The present study is a descriptive survey which aims at analyzing the study of attitude of secondary schools teachers towards inclusive education. Population for the present study comprises of students studying in secondary school teachers of District Mysore. The sample for the presents study comprises of 120 teachers from different secondary schools of Mysore district, with equal numbers of rural and urban selected adopting <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization</b> technique. Teacher‘s attitude scale towards inclusive education standardized and validated by Vishal Sood and Arti Anand. To conclude {{it can be said that}} inclusive education is a mandate today and the need of the hour. It is a matter of immense pleasure that inclusive education is in a progressive way all over the world, but still there is room for improvement. To remove the gap between inclusion and exclusion, teachers, parents, society, administrators and government should collectively work to implement the policies of inclusive education...|$|E
40|$|Summary: To date, many cytoprotective {{drugs have}} reached the stage of pivotal phase 3 {{efficacy}} trials in acute stroke patients. (Table 1) Unfortunately, throughout the neuroprotective literature, the phrase “failure to demonstrate efficacy” prevails as a common thread among the many neutral or negative trials, despite the largely encouraging results encountered in preclinical studies. The reasons for this discrepancy are multiple, and have been discussed by Dr. Zivin in his review. Many of the recent trials have addressed deficiencies of the previous ones with more rigorous trial design, including more specific patient selection criteria (ensure homogeneity of stroke location and severity), <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization</b> algorithms (time-to-treat), narrowed therapeutic time-window and pharmacokinetic monitoring. Current trials have also incorporated biologic surrogate markers of toxicity and outcome such as drug levels and neuroimaging. Lastly, multi-modal therapies and coupled cytoprotection/reperfusion strategies are being investigated to optimize tissue salvage. This review will focus on individual therapeutic strategies and we will emphasize {{what we have learned}} from these trials both in terms of trial design and the biologic effect (or lack thereof) of these agents...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{based on}} variance ratios and multiperiod-return autocorrelations {{concludes that the}} stock market exhibits mean reversion in the sense that a return in excess of the average tends to be followed by partially offsetting returns in the opposite direction. Dividing history into pre- 1926, 1926 - 46, and post- 1946 subperiods, we find that the mean-reversion phenomenon is a feature of the 1926 - 46 period, but not of the post- 1946 period which instead exhibits persistence of returns. Evidence for pre- 1926 data is mixed. The statistical significance of test statistics is assessed by estimating their distribution using <b>stratified</b> <b>randomization.</b> Autocorrelations of multiperiod returns imply a forecast of future returns, which is presented for post-war three-year returns using 1926 - 46, full sample, and sequentially updated coefficient estimates. The correlation between actual and forecasted returns is negative in each case. We conclude that evidence of mean reversion in U. S. stock returns is substantially weaker than reported in the recent literature. If mean-reversion continues to be a feature of the stock market, then the experience of the past forty years has been an aberration. ...|$|E
40|$|Background/purposeSuicide is a {{major concern}} in public health worldwide. Early {{identification}} of individuals at risk is critical for suicide prevention. The present study revised the 5 -item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS- 5) to a checklist format (BSRS- 5 R) and validated the BSRS- 5 R into a screening tool for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public. MethodsThe study participants consisted of two subsets of sample from community residents and psychiatric patients. The community subjects were recruited from <b>stratified</b> proportional <b>randomization</b> sampling in a nationwide community survey, while the psychiatric patients were from psychiatric outpatient service and psychiatric daycare unit in a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. All participants responded to the questionnaire investigating the BSRS- 5, personal experience with suicide, and demographic information. ResultsIn total, 2147 community respondents and 700 respondents from psychiatric settings completed the survey questions. The BSRS- 5 R was highly correlated to BSRS- 5 with good internal consistency in our study sample. For the community subjects, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal cutoff of 2 / 3 for BSRS- 5 R to discriminate psychiatric morbidity or suicide ideation. The BSRS- 5 R could also identify psychiatric morbidity in psychiatric outpatients and daycare patients. In addition, the cutoff of 4 / 5 for BSRS- 5 R to determine suicide ideation yielded moderately good predictive validity in psychiatric outpatients and in daycare patients. ConclusionThe BSRS- 5 R was validated as an efficient checklist to screen for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public. The result is valuable in translating into general medical and community settings for early detection of suicide ideation...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{inference}} for {{the average}} treatment effect in randomized controlled trials with covariate-adaptive randomization. Here, by covariate-adaptive randomization, we mean randomization schemes that first stratify according to baseline covariates and then assign treatment status so as to achieve "balance" within each stratum. Such schemes include, for example, Efron's biased-coin design and <b>stratified</b> block <b>randomization.</b> When testing the null hypothesis that the average treatment effect equals a pre-specified value in such settings, we first show that the usual two-sample t-test is conservative {{in the sense that}} it has limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis no greater than and typically strictly less than the nominal level. In a simulation study, we find that the rejection probability may in fact be dramatically less than the nominal level. We show further that these same conclusions remain true for a naive permutation test, but that a modified version of the permutation test yields a test that is non-conservative {{in the sense that it}}s limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis equals the nominal level for a wide variety of randomization schemes. The modified version of the permutation test has the additional advantage that it has rejection probability exactly equal to the nominal level for some distributions satisfying the null hypothesis and some randomization schemes. Finally, we show that the usual t-test (on the coefficient on treatment assignment) in a linear regression of outcomes on treatment assignment and indicators for each of the strata yields a non-conservative test as well under even weaker assumptions on the randomization scheme. In a simulation study, we find that the non-conservative tests have substantially greater power than the usual two-sample t-test...|$|R
