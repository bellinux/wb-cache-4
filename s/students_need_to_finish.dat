50|$|Aspiring law <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> {{at least}} a bachelor's degree before being {{admitted}} to the Faculty. They must then maintain an average of at least 78 in their freshman year to be readmitted the succeeding year. The required minimum grade increases as the year level progresses (79 for the second year, 80 {{for the third year}} and 81 for fourth year). During the third year of stay in the Faculty and after finishing all the law subjects, the student is required to engage in an internship program of at least 200 hours before being admitted to the fourth year, wherein he will then be required to undergo an oral examination or revalida and at least two major examinations to be able to complete the whole program. Upon graduation, the student will be qualified to become a bar candidate that will be eligible to take the bar examinations in the Philippines.|$|E
40|$|Students with {{a history}} of course failure usually have attitudes, {{behavior}} patterns or barriers that were a factor in course failure. Since these students often find completing coursework challenging, how can a high school support students who are now asked to work independently to complete challenging coursework online as part of a credit recovery program? The purpose of this needs assessment is to identify supports at-risk high school <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> online credit recovery courses. Teachers of the failed courses, and the adult tutors who assist student were surveyed for opinions regarding student skills, attitudes and supports for academic success as well as factors and barriers that appear to lead to student failure. All responses were compiled and focus group members examined the data, discussed responses and created recommendations. Additional structure was strongly suggested {{to meet the needs of}} students involved in the program. Recommendations were also generated toward a longer term plan to differentiate the options for students to earn additional credits in a meaningful way...|$|E
3000|$|The {{results from}} the Welch two-sample t test showed that the DCVs played a {{significant}} role when students were completing the assessment. First, the students who viewed the DCVs first (i.e., the VB group) outperformed those who viewed them later (i.e., the VA group). This result is remarkable, considering that the DCVs only took them about 3  min to complete and the average amount of time a <b>student</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the osmosis assessment portion of the entire survey was 47  min. The finding resonates with Kühl et al.’s (2011) study that dynamic visualization condition outperformed those with text-only condition. In addition, the time spent on watching DCV (T [...]...|$|R

Fast Track courses allow students to complete accredited high school courses, usually faster than the normal term. Where feasible, the course can be fitted to their own schedule. Fast Tracking does not mean taking short cuts.|$|R

5000|$|Michigan State University {{appointed}} Andrew D. Hunt, MD as {{the first}} dean of the College of Human Medicine in 1964. [...] The college began training pre-clinical medical students {{in the fall of}} 1966, though these <b>students</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> the final two years of their medical school education at other schools. The entering class of 1968 completed all four years of education at MSU, and graduated in the spring of 1972. In October 2007, the MSU Board of Trustees voted to approve a $90 million project to build a new educational facility in downtown Grand Rapids. [...] The construction was supported entirely with private funds, including $55 million from Spectrum Health and $5 million from Richard DeVos. [...] MSU alumnus and philanthropist Peter F. Secchia is the namesake for the facility, following his $10 million donation to the university. [...] In September 2010, the college's headquarters moved from Fee Hall in East Lansing to the newly built Secchia Center in Grand Rapids. To view the construction time-lapse video for The Secchia Center project visit https://oxblue.com/healthcare.php. [...] The college's administration maintain offices at both the East Lansing and Grand Rapids campuses.|$|R
50|$|The National History Bee {{was opened}} to {{elementary}} school-aged {{students for the}} 2012-2013 competition season. At the Elementary School level, the ORQE functions {{the same way as}} it does at the Middle School level. In 2012-2013, elementary school-aged students competed together with middle school-aged students at the Regional Bees. However, for purposes of qualifying for the National Championships elementary school-aged <b>students</b> only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> in the top 40% of elementary school-aged students at any given site, not in the top 40% of all students combined. Beginning with the 2013-14 competition season, elementary school-aged students will also compete in a separate group of students at the Regional Bees, as long as entry numbers allow for this. The Regional Bees for the Middle School and Elementary School levels will still be held at the same times and locations, though.|$|R

30|$|Cubric and Tosic (2017) built a {{question}} generator which used the ontology-based generation strategies defined by Papasalouros. However, they extended the property-based strategies {{to include more}} sub-strategies, which used the annotation properties in the ontology. Moreover, instead of using Papasalouros’s stem template, which {{is not related to}} an educational theory, Cubric and Tosic defined a set of stem templates, which aimed to assess student cognition at different levels in the Bloom’s taxonomy, which is widely used in the educational research (BS 1956; Krathwohl 2002; Anderson and Sosniak 1994). Bloom’s taxonomy categorise the assessment questions into the following six major levels, which are arranged in a hierarchical order according to the complexity of the cognitive process involved (BS 1956; Krathwohl 2002; Assessment 2002): 1) Knowledge: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> only <b>to</b> recall certain concepts in the domain. For example <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> list, define, and describe specific concepts in the domain without understanding how they are related to other concepts. 2) Comprehension: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> start thinking about the meaning of the concepts in terms of their relationship with other concepts in the domain. 3) Application: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate their ability to use the concepts they have learned in real situations. For example the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> provide and show examples that prove their understanding of the domain concepts. 4) Analysis: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> understand the domain terminology structure. For example the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have a good overview of the concepts in the domain by analysing how they are classified and related to each other. 5) Synthesis: at this level the students should be able to relate concepts from different domains to create and develop new ideas. 6) Evaluation: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make judgments, assess and compare ideas and evaluate the data.|$|R
