Upon d'Aragona's return, Osuna ordered him to prepare a campaign to face the Ottoman fleet in its own waters. The Viceroy had been warned of the departure of a large fleet from Constantinople, and although his informers did not notice the preparation of any attack against the island, he preferred to make <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> D'Aragona's galleys were reinforced, each one with 100 muskets, 50 spontoons, 20 bucklers and 150 chuzos in case it was necessary to arm the rowers to help the galley's soldiers to fight the Ottomans. Osuna's flagship, meanwhile, was reinforced with 160 musketeers and seven cannons. According to the Viceroy's spies, the Ottoman fleet was composed of 12 galleys under Mahomet Pasha, a lieutenant of Nasauf Pasha, who remained in Constantinople to consult with Sultan Ahmed I about issues concerning the war with Persia.|$|E
500|$|Lowell had {{intended}} never to remarry {{after the death}} of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, who many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell's first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, [...] "My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, & as long as I am <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I can afford to wait till my friends agree with me." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing Beresford's after action report, Wellington {{was unhappy}} with its despondent tone and commented to a staff officer [...] "This won't do. It will drive the people in England mad. Write me down a victory." [...] The report was duly rewritten, {{although}} Wellington privately acknowledged that another such battle would ruin his army. Soult, {{on the basis of}} higher allied casualties, also claimed [...] "a signal victory". He generously paid tribute to the steadfastness of the allied troops, writing [...] "There is no beating these troops, in spite of their generals. I always thought they were bad soldiers, now I am <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I had turned their right, pierced their centre and everywhere victory was mine– but they {{did not know how to}} run!" ...|$|E

500|$|The coin {{that formed}} {{the base of the}} medalet was most likely minted in England, {{probably}} at Canterbury. Evans felt that it was produced by a Frankish member of Liudhard's household, but Grierson was less <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being produced by a Frank. Both, however, concluded that it was not really meant to be used as money, but was rather struck for use as a medallion showing conversion to Christianity. The historian Margaret Deanesly argued that it was made at Canterbury, by a native Jutish artisan. Given the dates of Æthelberht's reign, it appears likely that the coin was struck between 578 and 589. [...] The loop for suspension is a feature of bracteates, pagan Germanic quasi-coins apparently made as amulets or jewellery, and often featuring a king. However bracteates are only stamped on one side.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality {{and its role in}} his work: [...] "I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm <b>sure</b> <b>of.</b> ... <b>It</b> wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
