Our objective was to design a space to evaluate the performance of Swiss-developed low exergy building systems in the tropical climate of Singapore using an integrated design approach. The method we employed for evaluation in the tropics was to design and build a test bed out of the shipping containers that transported the prototype low exergy systems from Switzerland to Singapore. This approach resulted in a novel laboratory environment containing radiant cooling panels and decentralized air supply, along with a self-shading, inflated “bubble” skin, experimental low emissivity (LowE) glazing, LED lighting, wireless sensors and distributed control.

Gravimetric method was used to determine the tobacco dust concentrations in the emission sources an also indoor workplace. A local exhaust ventilation system was designed according to the velocity pressure method recommended by ACGIH. Mean tobacco dust concentrations (ranged from 23. 56 to 432. 59 µgm- 3) were higher than TLV-TWA in the proximity of all indoor emission sources where some individuals were working. However, mean indoor and outdoor tobacco dust concentrations (7. 71 and 0. 04 µgm- 3 respectively) were lower than TLV-TWA. Totally 5 <b>separated</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and 5 centrifugal fans were designed and selcted to pull the air through 46 different hoods. Some downward slot hoods similar to VS- 708 type were designed for the work-tables in tipping unit and some upward slot hoods that are similar to VS- 903 type recommended by ACGIH's industrial ventilation committee were also selected for tipping manipulation unit. Some enclosing hoods were designed for feeders. Duct velocity of 1060 mmin- 1 has been selected for all systems. Total air flow rates ranged from 240 - 369 m 3 min- 1. A very high efficient bag house containing several bag filters was used to collect dust. In conclusion, because of a high concentartion of tobacco dust in the proximity of sources and risk of workers exposure to tobacco dust, a suitable local exhaust ventilation system was designed to reduce particulate air pollution concentrations in a tobacco processing factory...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{challenges}} that {{add to the}} difficulty when attempting to extract ancient DNA from fossils and prepare it for analysis. DNA is continuously being split up. While the organism is alive these splits are repaired; however, once an organism has died, the DNA will begin to deteriorate without repair. This results in samples having strands of DNA measuring around 100 base pairs in length. Contamination is another significant challenge at multiple steps throughout the process. Often other DNA, such as bacterial DNA, will {{be present in the}} original sample. To avoid contamination it is necessary to take many precautions such as <b>separate</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and workspaces for ancient DNA extraction work. The best samples to use are fresh fossils as uncareful washing can lead to mold growth. DNA coming from fossils also occasionally contains a compound that inhibits DNA replication. Coming to a consensus on which methods are best at mitigating challenges is also difficult {{due to the lack of}} repeatability caused by the uniqueness of specimens.|$|E

40|$|Objective. —To {{determine}} the number and protectiveness of local smoking regulations adopted before {{the implementation of a}} preemptive statewide smoking control bill. Method. —Review of local smoking control regulations from all 100 counties and 85 municipalities with populations greater than 5000 in North Carolina. Main Outcome Measures. —Adoption of local smoking control regulations before and during the 3 -month delay in enactment of the preemptive bill. Protectiveness of regulations was based on restrictions on smoking and requirements for <b>separate</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems at private work sites: none (smoking unrestricted); minimal (smoking restricted to designated areas); partial (smoking restricted to designated areas served by <b>separate</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems); and complete (smoking prohibited). Because some regulations would be phased in gradually over the next 5 years, we evaluated the requirements that will be in effect by January 1, 2000. Results. —Between July 15 and October 15, 1993, the number of local smoking regulations in North Carolina increased from 16 to 105. By the year 2000, 59 % of private employees still will not be guaranteed any protection from work site environmental tobacco smoke; 19 % will have minimal protection, 22 % will have partial protection, and none will have complete protection. Conclusions. —The 3 -month delay in preemption created an unnatural time frame for communities to organize, debate, and adopt smoking restrictions. Despite the adoption of 89 new regulations, no private employees will be guaranteed complete protection from work site environmental tobacco smoke by the year 2000; new regulations can no longer be adopted.

40|$|Introduction Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{has been}} shown to be able to distinguish both ventilation and perfusion. With adequate filtering the regional distributions of both ventilation and perfusion and their relationships could be analysed. Several methods of separation have been suggested previously, including breath holding, electrocardiograph (ECG) gating and frequency filtering. Many of these methods require interventions inappropriate in a clinical setting. This study therefore aims to extend a previously reported frequency filtering technique to a spontaneously breathing cohort and assess the regional distributions of ventilation and perfusion and their relationship. Methods Ten healthy adults were measured during a breath hold and while spontaneously breathing in supine, prone, left and right lateral positions. EIT data were analysed with and without filtering at the respiratory and heart rate. Profiles of ventilation, perfusion and ventilation/perfusion related impedance change were generated and regions of ventilation and pulmonary perfusion were identified and compared. Results Analysis of the filtration technique demonstrated its ability to <b>separate</b> the <b>ventilation</b> and cardiac related impedance signals without negative impact. It was, therefore, deemed suitable for use in this spontaneously breathing cohort. Regional distributions of ventilation, perfusion and the combined ΔZV/ΔZQ were calculated along the gravity axis and anatomically in each position. Along the gravity axis, gravity dependence was seen only in the lateral positions in ventilation distribution, with the dependent lung being better ventilated regardless of position. This gravity dependence was not seen in perfusion. When looking anatomically, differences were only apparent in the lateral positions. The lateral position ventilation distributions showed a difference in the left lung, with the right lung maintaining a similar distribution in both lateral positions. This is likely caused by more pronounced anatomical changes in the left lung when changing positions. Conclusions The modified filtration technique was demonstrated to be effective in <b>separating</b> the <b>ventilation</b> and perfusion signals in spontaneously breathing subjects. Gravity dependence was seen only in ventilation distribution in the left lung in lateral positions, suggesting gravity based shifts in anatomical structures. Gravity dependence was not seen in any perfusion distributions...|$|R
50|$|A similar, {{but quite}} <b>separate</b> issue, is <b>ventilation,</b> which {{occurs when a}} {{propeller}} operating near the surface draws air into the blades, causing a similar loss of power and shaft vibration, but without the related potential blade surface damage caused by cavitation.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveDisturbances of the {{alveolar}} surfactant {{system have}} {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of exogenous surfactant administration on surfactant properties in a model of single lung transplantation. MethodsWe performed heterologous, left lung transplantation (+ 4 °C ischemia; 24 hours, Euro-Collins solution) in 6 foxhounds (untreated) and in 6 animals that received calf lung surfactant extract (Alveofact) prior to explantation (only donor lung; 50 mg/kg body weight) and immediately after onset of reperfusion (both lungs, 200 mg/kg body weight). <b>Separate</b> but synchronized <b>ventilation</b> of each lung was performed, in a volume-controlled, pressure-limited mode, with animals in prone position. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were collected in pretransplantation lungs (control), after 24 hours of ischemia prior to transplantation (0 hours) and 6 and 12 hours after reperfusion in both the grafts and the recipient native lungs. ResultsIschemic storage per se did not provoke any changes of the surfactant system; however, severe alterations occurred within 6 hours of reperfusion, resulting in a severe loss of surface activity, including a decrease in the percentage of the large surfactant aggregate fraction, reduction of the surfactant apoproteins SP-B and SP-C, the dipalmitoyl molecular species of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol within the large surfactant aggregate fraction. These abnormalities were restricted to the graft, with virtually normal surfactant function and composition being found in the recipient native lung. Surfactant administration fully normalized the biochemical and largely improved the biophysical surfactant properties, alongside maintenance of lung gas exchange properties. ConclusionsSevere surfactant abnormalities occur exclusively in the graft when performing <b>separate,</b> synchronized <b>ventilation</b> of each lung to attenuate ventilator-induced lung injury. Bronchoscopic surfactant administration provides protection against these abnormalities and may be a therapeutic strategy in lung transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Integration of {{dedicated}} outdoor air (OA) systems with parallel terminal systems represents a huge {{shift in the}} standard engineering design paradigm. This paper will present {{some of the issues}} that guided the migration path toward <b>separate</b> dedicated OA <b>ventilation</b> systems and away from delivering the ventilation via single all-air variable air volume systems. The paper will then attempt to show that once a shift in the design paradigm in favor of a <b>separate</b> dedicated OA <b>ventilation</b> system has occurred, questions concerning the thermodynamic state of the delivered ventilation arise. Some of the boundary conditions that impact the best state of the delivered ventilation air will be addressed. Specifically, the first variable of interest is supply air temperature and its impact on the size and, hence, the cost of the terminal equipment and the terminal reheat energy. The second specific variable is the dew-point temperature (DPT) and the resultant latent cooling capability of the delivered ventilation air and its impact on the types of terminal equipment that may be practical. If in the paradigm shift the supply air DPT is dropped low enough to remove all of the space latent loads, then sensibleonly terminal equipment, such as radiant ceiling panels, may become viable choices in some situations and eliminate the production of microbial problems in the spaces. Finally, this line of reasoning is extended further to note that when the space dew points are controlled with the dedicated OA, the terminal sensible equipment may use uninsulated sprinkler piping as the energy transport conduit.
