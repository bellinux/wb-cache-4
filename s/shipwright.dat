5|$|Círdan (<b>Shipwright)</b> is the epessë of a Telerin Elf who {{remained}} in Beleriand, and later Lindon, {{until the end of}} the Third Age. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as Nōwē, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the Falas.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{if they do}} not die {{in battle}} or from some other cause, the Elves of Middle-earth grow weary of it and desire to go to Valinor, where the Valar {{originally}} sheltered their kind. Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands often go by boats provided at the Grey Havens, where Círdan the <b>Shipwright</b> dwells with his folk.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction <b>shipwright</b> Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shipwrights</b> {{were one}} of the first craft groups to be {{organised}} after the settlement of Australia, with the <b>Shipwrights</b> United Friends Society formed in 1829 to represent <b>shipwrights</b> in Sydney (then part of the Colony of New South Wales). Other unions were soon formed in the other colonies, including the Port Phillip <b>Shipwrights</b> Society, the Port Adelaide <b>Shipwrights</b> Society and the Brisbane <b>Shipwrights</b> Provident Union, while the Sydney union was renamed the <b>Shipwrights</b> Provident Union of New South Wales. After federation these small, local unions amalgamated to form a national organisation, which was registered federally in January 1916 as the Federated <b>Shipwrights</b> of Australia. Just a few months later, in September 1916, it changed to the Federated Shipwrights' Ship Constructors' & Boat Builders' Association of Australia. By the end of 1917, in what was a tumultuous period, the union had changed again, this time to the Federated <b>Shipwrights</b> Ship Constructors Naval Architects Ships Draughtsmen and Boat Builders of Australia. The union operated under this name until 1933 when it succumbed to a further name change: the Federated Shipwrights’ & Ship Constructors’ Association of Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shipwrights</b> {{were granted}} direct {{employment}} by the Crown. The first list of Master <b>Shipwrights</b> appointed by Patent by Henry VIII included John Smyth, Robert Holborn, Richard Bull, James Baker (father of Mathew Baker) and Peter Pett. On 23 April 1548, Robert Holborn, Smyth and Bull received similar patents, {{and it was}} added that, as <b>shipwrights,</b> they should instruct others, by reason of their long and good service.|$|R
50|$|The Federated Shipwrights' and Ship Constructors' Association of Australia was an Australian {{trade union}} which existed between 1916 and 1976. It {{represented}} <b>shipwrights</b> in the shipbuilding and ship repair industries, {{as well as}} sea-going <b>shipwrights</b> aboard vessels in the merchant navy.|$|R
5|$|The fort was {{positioned}} {{at one end}} of a new quay built along the harbour, near the entrance to the estuary, and was intended to engage any hostile ships that evaded the guns of Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It probably originally took the form of a circular tower, similar to the gun tower at Dartmouth Castle. In 1575, the fort was leased by the town to Thomas Carne, a <b>shipwright,</b> subject to it being returned to the town authorities if necessary for the defence of the town. During the 1598 Spanish invasion scare, the town authorities took over control of the fort in accordance with the agreement.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the <b>shipwright</b> Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Navy service in 1766 {{under the command}} of Captain Basil Keith, and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on the Navy's Jamaica Station. In August she docked at Deptford to take on crew and supplies, setting sail for the Caribbean on 28 November. Levant held her Jamaica post for three years, but this extensive service in tropical waters left her in poor condition. In 1770 she {{returned to}} Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned and hauled out of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to <b>shipwright</b> John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitting-out, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.|$|E
25|$|Indian <b>shipwrights</b> built {{water tanks}} or cisterns into their vessels {{that made the}} use of water buts or casks unnecessary. These tanks were {{perfectly}} water tight and saved stowage and manual labour. However, in their designs, the <b>shipwrights</b> did not prioritize sailing speed.|$|R

5|$|The American generals leading their {{shipbuilding}} effort {{encountered a}} variety of challenges. <b>Shipwright</b> was not a common occupation in the relative wilderness of upstate New York, and the Continental Navy had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast. The carpenters hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best-paid employees of the navy, excepting only the Navy's Commodore, Esek Hopkins. By the end of July {{there were more than}} 200shipwrights at Skenesborough. In addition to skilled help, materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough, where the ships were constructed, or Fort Ticonderoga, where they were fitted out for use.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Slade, the Surveyor of the Navy {{and former}} Master <b>Shipwright</b> at Deptford Dockyard, was the {{designer}} of the Venus-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun Southampton class, the Venus-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers. As a further innovation, Slade borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the lower deck gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size {{that would have been}} required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline. The lower deck carried additional stores, enabling Venus-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English <b>shipwright</b> Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E

25|$|Pownoll {{was born}} in Plymouth circa 1734, the son of master <b>shipwright</b> Israel Pownoll (d.1779), who had built {{a large number of}} {{warships}} for the Royal Navy over his career. Israel Pownoll served as master <b>shipwright</b> of the dockyard at Plymouth between 1762 and 1765, and of Chatham from 1775 until his death. He owned property in the Shadwell and Clerkenwell areas of London, suggesting that the family descended from the Independent seamen and merchants who were numerous in the Shadwell and Wapping area at the time, and had connections with New England. The naval antiquary Edward Hawke Locker later described Philemon as ‘a Gentleman of American extraction’.|$|E
