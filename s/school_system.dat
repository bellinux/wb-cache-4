5|$|An example {{may be a}} local <b>school</b> <b>system</b> in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the <b>school</b> <b>system</b> needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the <b>school</b> <b>system</b> needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E

5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public <b>school</b> <b>system.</b> These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public <b>school</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city <b>school</b> <b>system</b> allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the <b>school</b> <b>system</b> announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that Hindi be taught in the <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played {{a big role in}} the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the <b>school</b> <b>system</b> was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} quality assurance in New South Wales <b>school</b> <b>systems,</b> which was created from the restructuring of traditional centralized bureaucracies. The emergent struc':ure is comprised of devolved networks of schools operating withi I decentralized state systems. The purposes of these <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> are to enhance network effectiveness and to implement government policy initiatives. The paper first {{discusses the}} organizations that have evolved from recent reforms to decentralize <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> in most Australian states. It next discusses quality-assurance programs in <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> and analyzes key features of school inspectorates that existed {{for most of the}} first century of Australian public education. The role of quality assurance in the emerging network <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> is also described. If <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> are to develop as network organizations, the following issues must be addressed: the amount of line management needed for implementation; access and exit arrangements for member organizations; and community and government roles.
