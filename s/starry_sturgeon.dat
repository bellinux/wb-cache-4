5000|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>{{sturgeon}}</b> (Acipenser stellatus) {{also known}} as stellate sturgeon or sevruga (Drakul, اوزون برون , and Uzun Burun), is a species of sturgeon. It is native to the Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean sea basins, {{but it has been}} extirpated from the last and it is predicted that the remaining natural population will follow soon due to overfishing. It is considered critically endangered by the IUCN and international trade in this species (including its caviar) is restricted by CITES. The <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is an anadromous species, which migrates up rivers to spawn.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is a {{harmless}} species that feeds on fish, worms, crustaceans and mollusks. It {{lies on the}} bottom {{during the day and}} feeds mostly at night. This fish is anadromous and moves upriver into shallow waters to spawn.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is an {{important}} commercial species of fish. It {{is one of the}} three most important species for caviar, see [...] "Sevruga caviar", along with the Beluga sturgeon and the Persian sturgeon. Its flesh is considered an expensive delicacy in the Caspian region. It is used to make kabaabs, or is consumed pan fried, broiled, or smoked. There have been several attempts in Russia, Iran, Italy, and the United States to adapt this species for aquaculture, with varying degrees of success.|$|E
50|$|Endangered {{species that}} {{are found in the}} bay include the California brown pelican, California clapper rail, and salt marsh harvest mouse. This is a popular {{destination}} for recreation fishing, with Saltwater species including: striped bass, surfperch, <b>sturgeon,</b> <b>starry</b> flounder, leopard shark, topsmelt, and anchovy. In the 1880s there was a shrimp-fishing village, where some 500 Chinese people lived; they shipped approximately 90% of their catch to China. The location is now part of China Camp State Park.|$|R
50|$|The Upper Danube {{ecoregion}} {{alone has}} about 60 fish species and the Lower Danube-Dniester ecoregion has {{about twice as}} many. Among these are an exceptionally high diversity of sturgeon, {{a total of six}} species (beluga, Russian sturgeon, bastard sturgeon, sterlet, <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> and European sea sturgeon), but these are all threatened and have largely-or entirely {{in the case of the}} European sea sturgeon-disappeared from the river. The huchen, one of the largest species of salmon, is endemic to the Danube basin, but has been introduced elsewhere by humans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> reaches about 220 cm {{in length}} and weighs up to 80 kg. It is a slim-bodied fish easily {{distinguished}} from other sturgeons by its long, thin and straight snout. A row of five small barbels lies closer to the mouth than {{to the tip of}} the snout. The scales on the lateral line number between thirty and forty and these features distinguish this fish from the Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii). Its general colouring is dark greyish-green or brown with a pale underside. The scales on the lateral line are pale. The maximum reported age for this species is 27 years.|$|E
50|$|The Russian {{sturgeon}} {{can grow}} to 210 cm {{but a more}} normal size is 110 to 140 cm. It has a relatively short and rounded snout with three pairs of unfringed barbels closer {{to the tip of}} the snout that to the mouth. The dorsal fin has 27 to 48 soft rays and the anal fin has 16 to 35. The number of scales along the lateral line varies from 21 to 50. This fish can be distinguish from the otherwise similar <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> by the shape of its snout, its barbels and scale arrangement. The upper surface is greyish-green, the lateral scales are pale and the belly white.|$|E
50|$|After the Russian {{conquest of}} the Ural basin in the late 16th century, {{the shores of the}} Ural became home to the Yaik Cossacks. One of their main {{activities}} was fishing for the sturgeon and related fishes (including the true sturgeon, <b>starry</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> and beluga) in the Ural River and the Caspian. A great variety of fishing techniques existed; the most famous of them was bagrenye (багренье, from bagor багор, meaning pike pole): spearing hibernating sturgeons in their underwater lairs in mid-winter. The bagrenye was allowed only on one day of the year. On the appointed day, a large number of Cossacks with pike poles were gathering on the shore; after a signal was given, they rushed on the ice, broke it with their poles, and speared and pulled the fish. Another fishing technique was constructing a weir, known as the uchug (учуг) across the river, to catch fish going upstream to spawn. Until 1918, an uchug was set up in the summer and autumn near Uralsk, so that the fish would not go upstream beyond the Cossacks land. While the uchug weirs were also known in the Volga Delta, the bagrenye was thought to be a uniquely Ural technique.|$|E
40|$|Growth rate of sterlet larvae and juveniles during 2008 and 2009 was studied under {{experimental}} and farming {{conditions in the}} Czech Republic. The embryos hatched when reaching a mean total length (TL) of 9. 0 [*]mm. Larvae were fed by living food, with a gradual transition to dry diet. The exogenous feeding and the larval period of ontogeny started at DAH 9 (day after hatching) reaching TL of 15 – 17 [*]mm accompanied by melanin plug exclusion. Towards the end of larval period (DAH 39 – 43, TL 50 – 58 mm), the embryonic finfold disappeared {{and the formation of}} fin apparatus was nearly completed. During the larval and early juvenile development, daily increments of TL and weight (w) ranged between 0. 33 – 4. 23 mm. d− 1 and 0. 0018 – 1. 6400 g. d− 1, respectively. The specific growth rate (SGR) ranged from 25. 65 to 2. 73 %. d− 1. Growth intensity and length parameters are similar to the <b>Starry</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> lower than those of the Siberian sturgeon and Russian sturgeon and significantly lower than at Beluga sturgeon. Sterlet’s Fulton weight condition factor (FWC) was higher than in the Siberian and <b>Starry</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> The development was also observed on the basis of morphological changes. The larval development could be divided into six steps...|$|E
40|$|Similar {{to other}} Chondrostean fish, Persian {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser persicus Borodin, 1897) andStarry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus Pallas 1771) have got Gymnovarian ovaries, and structure form oftheir reproduction system {{is such that}} eggs cannot readily leave it. In minimally invasive surgicaltechnique, a small incision {{is made in the}} wall of oviduct so that the eggs can easily leave it with theminimal manipulation and also the broodstock can survive. The aim of this work is to determine thedistance between gonopore and incision area according to size and species which results in a moreaccurate and flawless incision. The results of this study showed that the distance between gonopore andconjuncture area of the two oviducts depends on species and size of fish; this distance in Persiansturgeon with 115 - 191 centimeters fork length and <b>Starry</b> <b>sturgeon</b> with 122 - 143 centimeters fork lengthwere 4. 2 - 6. 3 and 3. 8 - 4. 5 centimeters, respectively. This distance is more than the incision depth that isgenerally made on the wall of one of the oviducts...|$|E
