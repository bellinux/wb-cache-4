5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth and}} final section, which begins at 5:35, is a brief {{instrumental}} reprise of the second movement {{that serves as a}} coda. After a second solo, a brief guitar riff is introduced, which Jonny Greenwood says [...] "was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> floating around for a while and the song needed a certain burn. It happened to be the right key and the right speed and it fit right in." [...] The song ends, as does the second section, with a short chromatically descending guitar motif.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Horsfield was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer, and advised that his playing career was over. As the disease was discovered in its early stages, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed, surgery proved successful and {{less than two months}} later he was given the all-clear. Horsfield decided to make his illness public to help spread awareness of the disease, and lent his support to a Premier League-backed project launched in 2009 to promote men's health issues. He said: [...] "Getting cancer was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get over. I got it, wanted to beat it and I did. Now I am just glad that I've got another chance in football." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling of <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E

500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the music}} on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of {{hardcore}} punk band Bad Brains' song [...] "Big Takeover". The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different time signatures: [...] "It was just <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I'll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but {{as if they were}} regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it down and make a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff." [...] River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante's, had contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but they were ultimately left off due to protests from his family. These were later included under different names on the album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: [...] "Nothing you will likely {{hear on the}} radio", Rootes explained. The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I also think it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Being {{straight}} man {{to one of}} the greatest entertainers of our time was not all that easy. We were not always chums. He would spend weeks not talking to me (except on air) for <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> unknowingly said or done. Once he even suspended me from the programme for some trivial matter. [...] I worked with him until his sudden death in 1956. I never stopped being a fan. I did not realise then that I had been prepared for another career on another electrical medium: the most potent communication device of the century.|$|E

2500|$|Suoranta {{states that}} he could not {{tolerate}} a situation [...] "where a young person was about to be sent into an uncertain, perhaps life-threatening, situation. If it was in my power to do <b>something,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do something.... Although I did not know what asylum, deportation, irregular immigration, or the Dublin agreement meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty." [...] Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley saw {{the flag}} raising(s) as an {{insignificant}} event in a devastating battle. He rarely {{talked to people}} about it {{and spent most of}} his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he [...] "just happened to be there". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that “Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to hide.” He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.|$|E
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E

2500|$|Appearing as a {{prosecution}} witness {{at the trial}} {{of members of the}} unit in 2009, Jefto Jankovic, former investigative judge with the Basic Court in Banja Luka, told how on 23 August 1992, after receiving a call from the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka, he went to Korićanske Stijene to conduct a crime-scene inspection: [...] "We arrived there at about 3pm We saw that the area was rocky, the canyon was about 100 to 300 meters deep. I saw two piles of corpses {{at the bottom of the}} canyon. The corpses were lying there one on top of the other. It was a frightening scene. It was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen in my life. As it was impossible to approach them, I asked our crime technician to record it using a video camcorder. This is all that we did during the course of the crime-scene inspection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Its initial {{concept was}} based on a poem Jackson had written and found in a notebook. Jackson's {{original}} lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam commented [...] "The lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up." [...] Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. [...] "We ended up with two different choruses," [...] said Jam. [...] "I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'" [...] "The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it {{at the end of the}} song." [...] Jackson presented three songs including [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] and an early version of [...] "Feels So Right," [...] later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was a better fit and a [...] "summertime record." [...] A slightly modified version was included on All for You, featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by Rockwilder. The song paved the way for All for You, with Jam stating [...] "All For You" [...] and [...] "Someone to Call My Lover" [...] and all those songs came off the energy of [...] "Doesn’t Really Matter." ...|$|E
