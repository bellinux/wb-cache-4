5|$|Chris and Bryan Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer {{reviewed}} and rated {{the show on}} a <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of 10, giving it a 7. This was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Nick Tylwalk, but lower than the 7.5 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. Compared to TNA's previous PPV event No Surrender, Bound for Glory was received better as No Surrender was given a 3 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Meanwhile, Chris and Bryan Sokol gave TNA's next PPV event Turning Point a 7 out of 10. Rival World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced two PPV events in October that competed against Bound for Glory IV. The first was the No Mercy PPV event on October5, while the second was the Cyber Sunday PPV event on October26. No Mercy was reviewed by Chris and Bryan Sokol and given a 6 out of 10, lower than the Bound for Glory IV rating. Cyber Sunday was rated an 8 out of 10 by Andy McNamara, higher than the Bound for Glory rating. Compared to WWE's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event on March30, Bound for Glory IV was outperformed as WrestleMania XXIV was given a 9 out of 10 by Dale Plummer.|$|E

Until the 1950s there existed over a thousand water undertakings, with administrative boundaries {{similar to those of}} local government boundaries. By the early 1970s their number had been reduced to 198 by a gradual consolidation process aimed at achieving economies of <b>scale.</b> <b>Out</b> of the 198 water undertakings 64 were run by individual local government authorities, 101 by joint boards comprising several local government authorities, and 33 were statutory privately owned water companies, some of which date back to the Victorian era. At the same time there were over 1,300 sewerage and sewage disposal authorities, most of them run by individual local government authorities. The sector thus was highly fragmented.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Scaling</b> <b>out</b> and up are terms {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} describe a desired expansion of beneficial impacts from agricultural research and rural development. This paper explores strategies for <b>scaling</b> <b>out</b> production and livelihood impacts from proven technologies. We draw on {{a case study of}} forages and livestock production in Laos, a Southeast Asian country undergoing rapid economic and agricultural change. A facilitated learning environment stimulated farmers to adapt forages, livestock housing, and animal health practices to their own situations (<b>scaling</b> <b>out).</b> Regular follow-up visits and on-the-job mentoring for extension staff provided institutional support (scaling up). Within 5 years, the number of villages and households using forages and fattening livestock had increased six fold, with a 50 % reduction in the time required for farmers to get sig-nificant benefits. The paper concludes that <b>scaling</b> <b>out</b> positive impacts from systems change requires field tested and proven technologies, evidence of significant livelihood impacts, fostering of local innovation, competent field staff, effective peer learning, and ongoing institutional support...|$|R
500|$|Chris and Bryan Sokol {{rated the}} matches on a <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of 10, {{with the main}} event {{receiving}} a 7. The Jeff Jarrett versus Kurt Angle bout and the Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match were both given an 8 out of 10. The Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage was given a 7, while the X Division Championship match got a 6 out of 10. In their review, they commented that {{the ending of the}} event was a [...] "sloppy finish to a decent PPV". They felt the Jarrett versus Angle contest was a [...] "great match with lots of close calls and near falls", while the Three Way War they considered was [...] "pretty good".

500|$|Israel {{accomplished}} its {{objective of}} destroying the Fatah camp, {{and on a}} tactical level, the battle did indeed end in Israel's favor. [...] "The Karama operation exposed the vulnerability of PLO units deployed along the Jordan River and so they moved their concentrations up into the mountains. This imposed additional strains on them and made their operations into the West Bank even more involved and difficult {{than they had been}} hitherto." [...] Politically however, Israel was heavily condemned by the world opinion. U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Arthur Goldberg, said [...] "We believe that the military counteractions such as those which have just taken place, on a <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of proportion to the acts of violence that preceded it, are greatly to be deplored." [...] US Ambassador to Israel, Walworth Barbour, said that in twenty years time, a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the destruction of Israel. Eban reported the Ambassabor's statement to the cabinet, and Menachem Begin said such an utterance must not be cited in a cabinet meeting.|$|E

Keller rated the matches on a <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of 5 stars, {{with the main}} event given a 3 1/4 stars and called a [...] "fine match that fit its slot on the PPV well" [...] but had a finish that he described as [...] "horrible". He gave Jarrett versus Angle 3 1/2 stars with Keller commenting {{that it was a}} [...] "good old-school match ... but a bit slow". The Three Way War received a 3 star rating, stating that there was [...] "enough good" [...] but overall it was [...] "above-average." [...] The Monster's Ball match was given 3 1/4 stars in the review and called [...] "an exciting match" [...] with Keller explaining that there were [...] "four stars worth of action, but it crossed into gratuitousness" [...] and also criticized some awkward moments and the fire's danger. The X Division Championship contest got 2 1/4 stars with Keller commenting that it [...] "started okay" [...] with the middle being a [...] "little too slow" [...] and that the [...] "build to the finish was solid" [...] but the [...] "actual pin was sloppy".|$|E

60|$|Never {{was a new}} ruler in a {{more desperate}} plight than Lincoln when he entered office {{on the fourth of}} March, 1861, four months after his election, and took his oath to support the Constitution and the Union. The {{intervening}} time had been busily employed by the Southern States in carrying out their threat of disunion in the event of his election. As soon as the fact was ascertained, seven of them had seceded and had seized upon the forts, arsenals, navy yards, and other public property of the United States within their boundaries, and were making every preparation for war. In the meantime the retiring President, who had been elected by the slave power, and who thought the seceding States could not lawfully be coerced, had done absolutely nothing. Lincoln found himself, by the Constitution, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, but with only a remnant of either at hand. Each was to be created on a great <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of the unknown resources of a nation untried in war.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} not to smile at this outpouring of attachment; nor, on the whole, would I have been surprised at the ambition it inferred, had the youth been but a very little higher in the social <b>scale.</b> <b>Out</b> of the large towns, and with here and there an exception {{in favor of an}} isolated family, there is not, even to this day, much distinction in classes among our eastern brethren. The great equality of condition and education that prevails, as a rule, throughout all the rural population of New England, while it has done so much for the great body of their people, has had its inevitable consequences in lowering the standard of cultivation among the few, both as it is applied to acquirements, and to the peculiar notions of castes; and nothing is more common {{in that part of the}} world, than to hear of marriages that elsewhere would have been thought incongruous, for the simple reason of the difference in ordinary habits and sentiments between the parties. Thus it was, that Zephaniah, without doing as much violence to his own, as would be done to our notions of the fitness of things, might aspire to the hand of Ursula Malbone; unattended, as she certainly was, by any of the outward and more vulgar signs of her real character. I could not but feel some respect for the young man's taste, therefore, and this so much the more readily, because I no longer was haunted by the very silly phantom of his possible success.|$|E

He raises the issue of where <b>scaling</b> <b>out</b> should be done, who decides this and who is responsible for the <b>scaling</b> <b>out.</b> It seems there is no fixed methodology, but some guiding principles could be identified: - Many more stakeholders and actors need to be involved. We are not talking just of a technology, it is a process that needs other actors like traders, private sector, credit, etc - Political support is needed, from government, also excitement from the NGO sector and others - Many specialized capacities are needed, eg for targeting, facilitating, bringing together the actors - There is a big role for media and communications to get get the story out and help build consensus among all the actors Finally, he drew attention to some 'special skill' and motivations that are necessary to bring the stakeholders together: "The chemistry of the key stakeholder has to fit; if that's not working it becomes very very difficult. ...|$|R

60|$|We Americans {{are accused}} of making too much ado about our celebrities, of being demonstratively {{conscious}} of each step that we take {{in the path of}} progress; and the accusation has its ground doubtless in this sense, that it is possible among us to-day to become a celebrity on unprecedentedly easy terms. This, however, at the present hour is the case all the world over, {{and it is difficult to}} see where the standard of just renown remains so high that the first stone may be cast. It is more and more striking that the machinery of publicity is so enormous, so constantly growing and so obviously destined to make the globe small, in relation of the objects, famous or obscure, which cover it, that it procures for the smallest facts and the most casual figures a reverberation to be expected only in the case of a world-conqueror. The newspaper and the telegram constitute a huge sounding-board, which has, every day and every hour, to be made to vibrate, to be fed with items, and the diffusion of the items takes place on a <b>scale</b> <b>out</b> of any sort of proportion to their intrinsic importance. The crackle of common things is transmuted into thunder--a thunder perhaps more resounding in America than elsewhere for the reason that the sheet of tin shaken by the Jupiter of the Press has been cut larger. But the difference is only of degree, not of kind; and if the system we in particular have brought to perfection would seem to be properly applied only to Alexanders and Napoleons, it is not striking that these adequate subjects present themselves even in other countries. The end of it all surely no man can see, unless it be that collective humanity is destined to perish from a rupture of its tympanum. That is a theme for a later hour, and meanwhile perhaps it is well not to be too frightened. Some of the items I just spoke of are, after all, larger than others; and if, as a general thing, it is a mistake to pull up our reputations to see how they are growing, there are some so well grown that they will bear it, and others of a hardy stock even while they are tender. We may feel, for instance, comparatively little hesitation in extending an importunate hand towards the fine young sapling of which Mr. Reinhart is one of the branches. It is a plant of promise, which has already flowered profusely and the fragrance of which it would be affectation not to to notice. Let us notice it, then, with candor, for it has all the air of being destined to make the future sweeter. The plant in question is of course simply the art of illustration in black and white, to which American periodical literature has, lately given such an impetus and which has returned the good office by conferring a great distinction on our magazines. In its new phase the undertaking has succeeded; and it is not always that fortune descends upon so deserving a head. Two or three fine talents in particular have helped it to succeed, and Mr. Reinhart is not the least conspicuous of these. It would be idle for a writer in Harper to pretend to any diffidence of appreciation of his work: for the pages are studded, from many years back, with the record of his ability. Mr. Rein-hart took his first steps and made his first hits in Harper, which owes him properly a portrait in return for so much portraiture. I may exaggerate the charm and the importance of the modern illustrative form, may see in it a capacity of which it is not yet itself wholly conscious, but if I do so Mr. Reinhart is partly responsible for the aberration. Abundant, intelligent, interpretative work in black and white is, to the sense of the writer of these lines, one of the pleasantest things of the time, having only to rise to the occasion to enjoy a great future. This idea, I confess, is such as to lead one to write not only sympathetically but pleadingly about the artists to whom one looks for confirmation of it. If at the same time as we commemorate what they have done we succeed in enlarging a little the conception of what they may yet do, we shall be repaid even for having exposed ourselves as fanatics--fanatics of the general manner, I mean, not of particular representatives of it.|$|E
