40|$|A single condition, limited arbitrage, {{is shown}} to be {{necessary}} and sufficient {{for the existence of}} a competitive equilibrium and the core in economies with any number of markets, finite or infinite, with or without short sales. This extends earlier results of Chichilnisky [8] for finite economies. This unification of finite and infinite economies is achieved by proving that in Hilbert <b>spaces</b> limited <b>arbitrage</b> is necessary and sufficient for the compactness of the Pareto frontier. Limited arbitrage has also been shown to be necessary and sufficient for a resolution of the social choice paradox [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} for modelling real world high frequency financial data. The methodology copes with the erratic arrival {{of data and}} is robust to additive outliers in the data set. Arbitrage pricing relationships are formulated into a linear state <b>space</b> representation. <b>Arbitrage</b> opportunities violate these pricing relationships and are analogous to multivariate additive outliers. Robust identification/filtering of arbitrage opportunities in the data is accomplished by Kalman filtering. The state space model {{used to describe the}} pricing relationships is general enough to handle both linear and non-linear models. The recursive Kalman equations are adapted to filter tick data, cope with the erratic arrival of observations and produce estimates of all the arbitrage prices on every time step. We demonstrate the methodology with a robust neural network filter applied to foreign exchange triangular arbitrage. Tick data from three markets is used: $/DM, /$, /DM 1993 - 1995. The filter pro [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{topics of}} dual-listed {{companies}} (DLC, or Siamese twins) have been greatly intensified on arbitrage. Essentially, the implication from {{the effectiveness of}} arbitrage, which is theoretically assumed to function as the mechanism to realize the fundamental value of the underlying asset, is that the mispricing is not simply irrational in the real world, and the market is not as efficient as we expect it to be. Now the question is this- what can we expect from the prices of DLCs with the absence of arbitrage opportunities? Will the pair price merely show more randomness {{in the absence of}} arbitrage instead? One possible answer may hide in the performance of the DLCs listed on Chinas Shanghai/Shenzhen stock market (SSE/SZE) and Hong Kong (HSI) market. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the mispricing phenomena from the arbitrage-free market pair by adapting VAR and error correction model. Our results show that even without <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spaces,</b> many of the pairs still present a long-term convergence. Also we find that the the price of the host market does not dominate its counterpart in the foreign market as expected, and after controlling the potential market noise, a more favorable result of most of the DLCs show cointegration turns out. This implies that there should be some significant but undefined factors hidden in the whole market driving the dynamics of the mispricing...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{mobility}} in Europe {{continues to}} be on the rise, both creating <b>space</b> for regulatory <b>arbitrage</b> by companies and influencing legislative decisions in corporate law and related fields. This has triggered debates in European company law that centre on questions of harmonisation, cross-jurisdictional convergence and the superiority of certain regulatory approaches and legal families. This article uses a large cross-country sample of EU Member States to classify legal strategies in corporate governance and assess claims of convergence and the superiority of legal families. We analyse board structure, the most important duties of directors, namely the duties of care and loyalty, questions of enforcement, and the position of directors in the vicinity of insolvency, and develop a taxonomy of legal strategies across the Member States. We find that, in spite of differences in regulatory technique and legal tradition, the effect of the legal strategies employed by the Member States is often remarkably similar and legal systems exhibit interconnections in the form of mutual learning across borders. In addition, we show that, in contrast to claims by parts of the literature, judicial innovation is not restricted to particular legal families. We argue that all legal families are, in principle, well equipped to react to new developments and draw on general or unwritten principles of law to fill regulatory gaps. However, a precondition for the emergence of effective rules seems to be a sufficiently large body of case law and, accordingly, access to the courts and an efficiently functioning judicial system. Consequently, we submit that questions of enforcement are of greater importance than a particular legislative or regulatory style...|$|R
