40|$|When {{precipitation}} {{occurs in}} undeveloped areas {{a number of}} abstractions catch and absorb the precipitation. Abstractions include plants and trees, which catch {{a portion of the}} water, pervious soils that infiltrate stormwater until saturated and natural changes in topography where stormwater accumulates. During more intense, longer storm evens the abstraction limit in a watershed can be reached and runoff occurs. In the process of developing areas for cities, towns, industrial sites and transportation the watershed characteristics of that area are changed and the quantity of abstraction in the developed area is reduced. Pervious soils are replaced with impervious surfaces and plants that abstract, absorb and release moisture through evapotranspiration are removed. As a result a significantly larger quantity of surface runoff is generated in these areas. There are a number of methods used to manage the quantity of runoff. Two popular options are the combined sewer system and the <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>system.</b> The combined sewer system conveys stormwater runoff and sanitary sewage from households to a wastewater treatment plant. After treatment water is released into a receiving body {{and the quality of the}} effluent is monitored to comply with water quality regulations in general, or for water quality regulations at a particular receiving body of water. The <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> also known as the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS 4) conveys stormwater separate from sanitary waste.

A new definition of the first flush is derived from the analysis of the M(V) curves, allowing a non-ambiguous quantification of a phenomenon which, up to now, was presented in a principally descriptive or qualitative manner. It is assumed that there is a significant first flush if at least 80 % of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 30 % of the volume discharged during rainfall events. Previous definitions proposed by other authors are discussed with regard to the treatment of stormwater discharges. However, the concept of the first flush can not be used alone to establish a reliable methodology to design treatment facilities. Additional knowledge and information are necessary. From this point of view, the analysis of experimental M(V) curves is appropriate to base a design methodology which takes into account the intrinsic variability of the phenomena.

Sampling has been undertaken during wet weather and during dry weather between January 2010 and February 2011. Three dry weather and two wet weather samples have been taken every three months and from each outlet.

40|$|International audienceOur main {{objective}} was to characterize phthalate transfer mechanisms in the river Seine basin (France) under contrasted hydrological conditions. Phthalates were present in rural {{as well as in}} urban areas, and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was always prevailing. Hotspots of DEHP water concentrations were identified along the river Seine at wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and combined sewer overflow discharge locations. A spatial concentration increase was found (x 2 for di-ethyl phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate and x 3. 5 for DEHP) from upstream to downstream of the urbanized areas. Comparing hydrological conditions in the river Seine, from low to high water, a six-time increase in concentrations was found downstream of the urbanized areas, while a dilution process occurred at the rural station due to slightly contaminated inputs. A strong enhancement of annual specific flux for DEHP was estimated from upstream (33 g km(- 2) year(- 1)) to downstream (114 g km(- 2) year(- 1)) of the urbanized areas, corresponding to annual inputs of 4. 9 t. The monitoring of a combined sewer overflow discharge, following a strong storm event, showed a preferential distribution of compounds in the surface microlayer. DEHP enrichment ratios between subsurface and surface microlayer were for the dissolved and the particulate phases 2. 7 and 15, respectively. Even at the very upstream part of a rural elementary basin, impact of runoff input prevailed against that from WWTP discharge. Moreover, in a suburban basin equipped with a <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>system,</b> increase in phthalate concentrations under high flow conditions was strictly related to runoff processes.

40|$|Sewer misconnections lead {{to direct}} {{discharge}} of foul sewage to surface waters, which conflicts {{with one of}} the fundamental aims of a <b>separate</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> - to prevent discharge of foul sewage to surface waters. Though misconnections are often thought to be a threat to receiving water bodies, and to achieving Water Framework Directive targets, they have received little study to date, and their ecological impacts remain unknown. Review of current knowledge of misconnections and their potential impacts in receiving waters identified key areas of research which are required to improve understanding of the misconnection problem. To fully understand the impacts of misconnection effluents in receiving waters, their impacts in biological communities must be considered. Diatoms, a group of organisms which are commonly used for ecological assessments, {{play an important role in}} freshwater ecosystems and exhibit many characteristics which make them ideal for use in investigating response to intermittent stresses. This thesis investigates the impacts of misconnection effluents in the diatom communities of receiving waters. Current methods to identify misconnection effluents in sewer systems lack sensitivity to misconnection effluents specifically, and suffer from issues of low sampling frequency. An inexpensive, passive, method for detecting misconnection effluents in sewer systems using optical brighteners produced very promising results, and is highly appropriate for use by the Environment Agency and Water companies, pending further validation. Exposure of diatom communities to detergent effluents in a microcosm study show that detergents cause significant decrease of algal total abundance and notable change in community composition a closed laboratory system. These effects correlate well with high surfactant concentration and alkalinity in the detergents, leading to the conclusion that these are key drivers of responses in the diatom community. Specific diatom species are identified as potential indicators of detergent pollution, showing strong increases in abundance when exposed to high detergent concentrations. Diatom communities exposed to misconnection effluents in the field in one catchment showed a shift in community composition toward more motile species, indicative of exposure to organic pollution discharged from the misconnected outfalls, however communities in three other catchments did not show any such response. Common diatom based monitoring measures do not respond to effluents from misconnected sewer outfalls, and diatom communities do not show the decrease in abundance or shifts in species composition which were observed in the laboratory. Misconnection effluents have potential to cause significant impacts in diatom communities. However, low frequency of discharge, short exposure period, and high dilution of effluents, prevent significant responses in the diatom community. In the upland streams investigated, misconnections do not pose a significant threat to diatom communities...|$|E
