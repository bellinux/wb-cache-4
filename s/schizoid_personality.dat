25|$|In another study, Lin is {{described}} as having symptoms similar to those seen in patients of <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorder. Lin's personality traits including his aloofness, {{lack of interest in}} social relationships, secretiveness, and emotional coldness he exhibited during the Cultural Revolution suggest Lin suffered from symptoms similar to those seen in <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorder. The challenge of Lin's personality problems in conjunction with the turbulent political climate of the Cultural Revolution impacted his overall ability to govern his position.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{similarities}} between the schizotypal and <b>schizoid</b> <b>personalities.</b> Most notable of the similarities is the inability to initiate or maintain relationships (both friendly and romantic). The {{difference between the two}} seems to be that those labeled as schizotypal avoid social interaction because of a deep-seated fear of people. The schizoid individuals simply feel no desire to form relationships, because they see no point in sharing their time with others.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a report}} by {{forensic}} psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner, Fritzl's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. Fritzl referred to himself as an [...] "alibi" [...] child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove {{that she was not}} barren and could produce children. Fritzl claims that his pathological behavior is innate. He admits that he planned to lock his daughter up during his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction so that he could contain and express his [...] "evil side". He said, [...] "I was born to rape, and I held myself back for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter."

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{as a result}} of civilization has been developed further by psychologist Julian Jaynes in his 1976 book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind; he proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness. This would {{take the form of a}} [...] "bicameral mind" [...] where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by [...] "mysterious voices" [...] giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods. Researchers into shamanism have speculated that in some cultures schizophrenia or related conditions (such as schizotypal personality disorder) may predispose an individual to becoming a shaman; the experience of having access to multiple realities is not uncommon in schizophrenia, and is a core experience in many shamanic traditions. Equally, the shaman may have the skill to bring on and direct some of the altered states of consciousness psychiatrists label as illness. Psychohistorians, on the other hand, accept the psychiatric diagnoses. However, unlike the current medical model of mental disorders they may argue that poor parenting in tribal societies causes the shaman's <b>schizoid</b> <b>personalities.</b> Commentators such as Paul Kurtz and others have endorsed the idea that major religious figures experienced psychosis, heard voices and displayed delusions of grandeur.|$|R
40|$|Social {{anhedonia}} {{appears to}} be related to risk for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and thus is a promising indicator of Meehl's construct of schizotypy. Findings from diagnostic, cognitive, and psychophysiological studies have supported the validity of social anhedonia as an indicator of schizotypy, but only recently have the behavioral characteristics of these putative schizotypes been examined. This study replicated previous findings of atypical behavioral characteristics in social anhedonics and expanded upon prior research through an examination of their biological parents, serving as a preliminary investigation into the familiality of schizophrenia-spectrum behaviors. A community sample of 88 18 - to 19 - year-olds (48 social anhedonics, 40 controls) and their biological parents (42 mothers of social anhedonics, 37 mothers of controls; 24 fathers of social anhedonics, 20 fathers of controls) received diagnostic evaluations that were videotaped as part of an ongoing study and served as the basis for ratings of behavioral signs of schizoidia and schizotypy in the present study. Proband social anhedonics exhibited atypical interpersonal behaviors characteristic of <b>schizoid</b> and schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorders as well as clinical symptoms of <b>schizoid</b> and schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorders. Mothers of social anhedonics displayed atypical interpersonal behaviors characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder but did not show elevations on clinical symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum personality disorders. Meaningful, though not statistically significant, effects were observed for behavioral sign ratings and clinical symptom ratings of <b>schizoid</b> and schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorders in the smaller sample of fathers of social anhedonics. Correspondence on schizoid behavioral ratings was observed for probands, particularly males, and their fathers. Results provide preliminary support for the familiality of atypical interpersonal behavior in social anhedonics, as putative schizotypes...|$|R
25|$|<b>Schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> {{disorder}} is a poorly studied disorder, {{and there is}} little clinical data on SPD because it is rarely encountered in clinical settings.

25|$|<b>Schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> {{types are}} {{challenged}} to achieve self-awareness {{and the ability}} {{to assess the impact of}} their own actions in social situations.

25|$|<b>Schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> {{disorder}} (SPD) is {{a personality}} disorder {{characterized by a}} lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment, and apathy.

5000|$|In making {{assessments}} of mood and affect the clinician is cautioned that [...] "it {{is important to}} keep in mind that demonstrative expression can be influenced by cultural differences, medication, or situational factors"; while the layperson is warned to beware of applying the criterion lightly to [...] "friends, otherwise or she is likely to make false judgments, in view of the prevalence of <b>schizoid</b> and cyclothymic <b>personalities</b> in our 'normal' population, and our US tendency to psychological hypochondriasis".|$|R
50|$|This {{diagnostic}} rubric is {{not recommended}} for general use {{because it is not}} clearly demarcated either from simple schizophrenia or from <b>schizoid</b> or paranoid <b>personality</b> disorders, or possibly autism and Asperger syndrome as currently diagnosed. If the term is used, three or four of the typical features listed above should have been present, continuously or episodically, for at least 2 years. The individual must never have met criteria for schizophrenia itself. A history of schizophrenia in a first-degree relative gives additional weight to the diagnosis but is not a prerequisite.|$|R

25|$|People with <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> {{disorder}} {{are often}} aloof, cold, and indifferent, which causes interpersonal difficulty. Most individuals diagnosed with SPD have trouble establishing personal relationships or expressing their feelings meaningfully. They may remain passive {{in the face}} of unfavorable situations. Their communication with other people may be indifferent and terse at times. Because of their lack of meaningful communication with other people, those who are diagnosed with SPD are not able to develop accurate impressions of how well they get along with others.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the causes, however, psychoticism {{marks the}} two {{approaches}} apart, as the five factor model contains no such trait. Moreover, psychoticism, unlike {{any of the other}} factors in either approach, does not fit a normal distribution curve. Indeed, scores are rarely high, thus skewing a normal distribution. However, when they are high, there is considerable overlap with psychiatric conditions such as antisocial and <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> disorders. Similarly, high scorers on neuroticism are more susceptible to sleep and psychosomatic disorders. Five factor approaches can also predict future mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> {{disorder}} rarely {{seek treatment}} for their condition. This {{is an issue}} found in many personality disorders, which prevents {{many people who are}} afflicted with these conditions, who tend to view their condition as not conflicting with their self-image and their abnormal perceptions and behaviors as rational and appropriate, from coming forward for treatment. There is little data on the effectiveness of various treatments on this personality disorder due to the infrequency of encountering this personality disorder in clinical settings. However, those in treatment have the option of medication and therapy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, another German psychiatrist, Emil Kraepelin, {{included}} {{a chapter on}} psychopathic inferiority in his influential work on clinical psychiatry for students and physicians. He suggested six types - excitable, unstable, eccentric, liar, swindler and quarrelsome. The categories were essentially defined by the most disordered criminal offenders observed, distinguished between criminals by impulse, professional criminals, and morbid vagabonds who wandered through life. Kraepelin also described three paranoid (meaning then delusional) disorders, resembling later concepts of schizophrenia, delusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder. A diagnostic term for the latter concept would {{be included in the}} DSM from 1952, and from 1980 the DSM would also include <b>schizoid</b> and schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorders; interpretations of earlier (1921) theories of Ernst Kretschmer led to a distinction between these and another type later included in the DSM, avoidant personality disorder.|$|R
50|$|In {{children}} with night terrors, {{there is no}} increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses. However, in adults who suffer from night terrors there is a close association with psychopathology or mental disorders. There may be an increased occurrence of night terrors—particularly among those suffering or having suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night terrors, such as dependent, <b>schizoid,</b> and borderline <b>personality</b> disorders. There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have suffered from frequent night terrors. Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors. A study of adults with thalamic lesions {{of the brain and}} brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors. Night terrors are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy.|$|R
500|$|Kaczynski's lawyers, {{headed by}} Montana federal defender Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, {{attempted}} to enter an insanity defense {{to avoid the}} death penalty, but he rejected this plea. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed to not use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views. This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently {{tried to commit suicide}} by hanging on January 9. Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a <b>schizoid</b> or schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorder. In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists, who visited him frequently for four years, told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and a [...] "political diagnosis".|$|R
