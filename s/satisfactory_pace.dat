All EU member states are automatically members of both the EMU and the SGP, as this is defined by paragraphs in the EU Treaty itself.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} case of a 67 -year-old woman {{suffering}} from Ebstein's disease, who underwent three cardiac operations for bypass, tricuspid prosthesis and pacemaker implantation, and who needed an implantable cardioverter defibrillator for recurrent syncopes related to ventricular tachycardia. Because of the tricuspid prosthesis we chose to implant the defibrillation lead in the inferior vena cava. We collected <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pacing</b> and sensing data and performed a successful defibrillation test during the procedure.

40|$|A right-sided {{pneumothorax}} developed {{several hours}} after atrial lead repositioning following otherwise straightforward implantation of a biventricular defibrillator from a left subclavian approach. Right atrial lead perforation was presumed, though {{this could not}} be demonstrated on computed tomography. The patient was managed conservatively and made a full recovery. Case presentation A 63 -year-old man with no underlying lung disease underwent implantation of a biventricular defibrillator. The device was implanted in the left prepectoral region via a subclavian approach. Vascular access was straightforward. An active fixation Sprint Quattro ICD lead (6947) was located at the right ventricular apex, an active fixation CapSure Fix Novus (5076) within the right atrial appendage, and a unipolar Attain Ability lead (4196) in an anterolateral vein (Medtronic Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK). Post-procedure chest radiographs taken immediately {{and the next day}} were satisfactory. Technical checks on Day 1, however, revealed loss of atrial capture at high output, without macrodisplacement. Revision of the pacing system was undertaken, with repositioning of the atrial lead to an anterolateral position with <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pacing</b> parameters. No further instrumentation of the subclavian vein was required. An initial post-procedure radiograph was satisfac...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are {{performed}} routinely after permanent pacemaker implantation to identify pacemaker lead position and exclude pneumothorax. We assessed the clinical value {{and need for}} this procedure. Design: Retrospective analysis of pacemaker data and CXRs following permanent pacemaker insertion between December 2002 and February 2004. Materials and Methods: Post-procedural CXRs were available in 125 / 126 consecutive patients after either first endocardial pacemaker implantation or insertion {{of at least one}} new lead. Subclavian vein puncture was used for venous access in all cases. CXRs were examined to establish the incidence of pneumothorax and assess pacing lead positions. The clinical records were examined in all patients who had subsequent CXRs or a further pacemaker procedure to identify the indication for these and to establish whether CXR had influenced patient management. Results: In total, 192 post-procedural CXRs were performed, either postero-anterior (PA) and/or lateral views. Ventricular and/or atrial pacing lead contour and electrode position was considered radiographically appropriate in 86 &#x 0025; CXRs. Fourteen per cent of post-procedural radiographs were considered to have radiologically sub-optimal pacemaker lead positioning. None of the patients with these "abnormal" radiographs experienced subsequent pacemaker complications or had further radiographs recorded at a later date. Later repeat CXRs were performed in 16 patients (13 &#x 0025;) but only 3 patients (2 &#x 0025;) had pacing abnormalities as the primary indication. All three had <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pacing</b> lead position on initial post-implantation and later radiographs, but required further procedures for lead re-positioning. Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurred in one patient (incidence 0. 8 &#x 0025;) in our series. CXR confirmed the clinical diagnosis and allowed an assessment of size to guide treatment. Conclusion: Routine CXR after permanent pacemaker insertion is not necessary in uncomplicated cases with adequate pacing characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} was the qualitative evaluation of the hybrid fir trees (Abies borisii regis Matff.), existing in the university forest at Pertouli, Trikala (in Greece), under silvicultural and wood utilization criteria, in order to determine, how compression wood effect in the total production and to learn more about its formation and behavior as long as the tree grows up. Material of this study was 266 fir trees that have been cut in 630 section of university forest, in the summer of 2004. The method was completed in the following stages: 1. Stand structural analysis, by using 10 sample plots in proportion to the quality timber site (II, III, IV), according to stratified random sampling, 2. Study of the tree stem or wood structure growth and qualitative characteristics by growth defects measurement and classification, 3. Study of compression wood formation, distribution, frequency of appearance and intensity in tree stems, horizontally and vertically, 4. Study of how tree stem or wood structure growth and qualitative characteristics effected in compression wood and their correlation to compression wood 5. Study of compression wood effects in sawn timber and its correlation to longitudinal (bias, parallel and axial bending arrow) and transversely (base and top bending arrow) plank deformation. Moreover, deformation types were distinguished according to the number of the curve parts appeared longitudinally the sampling planks. The stand structure, in the study area is stepping to a mixture of tree groups with different ages and sizes as an irregular group selection system. The total yield and stem quality is being concentrated to exquisite trees, presenting large diameters and desirable growth features, while the majority of the other tree population presents individual stability, vitality and developmental tendency. Silvicultural treatment helps younger and smaller in diameter trees, to grow up easily by selective cuttings and regeneration fellings. Site quality II, in comparison with the other site qualities (III, IV) appears the highest yield but it is inferior regarding to social tree characteristics. The forest density is 548 trees/ha, with a total basal area of 30. 15 m 2 /ha and average diameter 21. 32 cm. The average height is 11. 03 m and the maximum average height 24. 56 m. The average free of branches stem length is 25. 1 % of tree’s height and the average crown height is 7. 25 m. The average quotient h/d (lissome index) is 52. 62 showing that trees’ stability is <b>satisfactory</b> and keeps <b>pace</b> with wood quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on the {{existing}} literature on national saving and investment we attempt to identify and empirically analyze the main drivers of Greece’s current account position in recent decades and, especially, {{in the years following}} the euro adoption. Our results seem to provide broad-based support to the key findings of a number of earlier empirical studies on the determinants of Greece’s current account position. More specifically, the significant deterioration in the country’s current account position in recent years can be attributed to, among others: (i) accumulated loss of economic competitiveness against main trade-partner economies; (ii) pronounced fiscal policy relaxation following the euro adoption; (iii) the completion of domestic financial sector liberalization in the mid- 90 s and enhanced financial deepening post the country’s euro area entry. To assess the capacity of the new EU-IMF economic adjustment programme to stabilize Greece’s external position, we utilize our estimated econometric models to produce out-of-sample forecasts for the evolution of the current account in 2012 - 2016. Specifically, we examine a number of alternative scenarios encompassing varying degrees of policy-adjustment and success rates in implementing the agreed reforms. Assuming a broadly <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pace</b> of programme implementation, we forecast a steady improvement in the country’s current account position in the years ahead. This is deemed to be an important prerequisite for stabilizing and gradually starting to reduce Greece’s external debt, from what currently appear to be unsustainable levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} {{recovery in the}} euro area lost momentum in 2004. After a strong increase during the first half, real GDP rose {{at an annual rate}} of less than 1 percent in the following two quarters. Overall capacity utilization, which had increased in the first half of 2004 for the first time in several years, fell once again. While internal demand picked up somewhat, the weakening of export growth could not be compensated. In the wake of the renewed weakness, labor market conditions did not improve. Inflation accelerated at the end of last year because of the surge in oil prices. High oil prices and the strength of the euro will dampen the economic expansion for a while, so the recovery will continue to be rather modest during the first half of 2005. Later on, the negative effects will fade, and economic activity will accelerate somewhat. We expect real GDP to increase by 1. 4 percent in 2005; the unemployment rate will remain high. Next year, the recovery will gain further momentum also because monetary policy will remain expansionary; we expect that the ECB will not raise key interest rates very soon. Real GDP growth will amount to 2. 0 percent in 2006, and the unemployment rate will drop to 8. 3 percent. Inflation will remain slightly below 2 percent in both years. The situation of public finances has deteriorated further. In 2004, the aggregated budget deficit rose to 2. 9 percent of GDP, compared to 2. 7 percent last year. In addition to Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Greece, the deficit ratio probably exceeded the 3 percent margin also in Portugal. Several governments will apparently not consolidate their budgets as intended by the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). In the recently published Stability Programs, the budgets of several large countries are not projected to be balanced until 2008, even though growth assumptions appear very optimistic. In March this year, the European governments and the European Commission decided on changes in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. They imply that budget deficits will be higher in the future and that the debt-to-GDP ratios will continue to rise. One reason for this is that countries can now claim special circumstances, which means that a deficit ratio above 3 percent will not automatically be called excessive. Furthermore, countries with high deficits should consolidate their budgets mainly in good times, which are defined as years in which the output gap is positive. And they are given more time than before to take corrective actions. All in all, the sustainability of public finances will deteriorate. The main target of the SGP - to balance the budgets in the medium term and to reduce government debt to below 60 percent of GDP at a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pace</b> - will not be achieved.

40|$|The {{vision of}} an {{economic}} and monetary union came to be realized within three stages. The limitations for capital movements were removed, the Economic Monetary Institute was founded and when the convergence criteria were met, the joint currency was launched. Italy did not pass the debt criterion {{to enter into the}} third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) but passed all the other criteria and was accepted. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was founded in 1997 to strengthen the budgetary surveillance of countries within the EMU. It consisted of two Council regulations and a Council resolution. In 2005 the SGP was reformed and from that point a lot clearer to interpret. For example, it had been hard to interpret the importance of the Other Relevant Factors (ORF) and which to include in the decision making of an excessive deficit with the unreformed SGP but after 2005 there were clear guidelines to follow. The same year as the reformation the Commission filed a report regarding Italy, the state had a deficit above the 3 % reference value and might have an excessive deficit. The Commission found that the deficit was neither temporary nor exceptional which suggested that the deficit criterion of the SGP was not fulfilled. They also found that the debt ratio was not sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>pace</b> and thereby they did not fulfil the debt criterion. The Commission was of the opinion that there existed an excessive deficit in Italy. The Council was of the same opinion and gave Italy strong recommendations to follow for a correction of the excessive deficit. In 2006 and 2008, two follow-up reports about action taken by Italy for the correction was sent from the Commission to the Council. The first one found that there was no meaning to continue the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and the second one, sent in 2008, was about an abrogation of the decision of the existence of an excessive deficit in 2005. The Council also carried this out. No {{more than a year after}} the abrogation a new process started and Italy was once again found with an excessive deficit. The EDP was anew in full action. In a report in 2010 the Commission found that Italy had under the circumstances, amongst other the widely spread economic downturn, taken the adequate action for a correction of the excessive deficit within its time limit. The Council once again agreed and no further steps of the EDP were taken at this stage. Italy has, under the entire time period presented in this paper, failed to reach the debt and deficit criteria and have been acted on in accordance with the SGP. The changes or clarifications if you rather call it that, of the SGP has been of major help to the Commission and Council in their opinions, decisions and recommendations regarding the existence of an excessive deficit and its correction. Without the changes, the outcome for Italy might have been different...|$|E
