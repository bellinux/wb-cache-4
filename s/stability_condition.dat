50|$|In the 1950s, {{the field}} of {{theoretical}} plasma physics emerged. The confidential research of the war time years became declassified and allowed the publication and spread of very influential papers. The world rushed {{to take advantage of}} the recent revelations on nuclear energy. Although never fully realized, the idea of controlled thermonuclear fusion motivated many to explore and research novel configurations in plasma physics. Instabilities plagued early designs of artificial plasma confinement devices and were quickly studied partly as a means to inhibit the effects.The analytical equations for interchange instabilities were first studied by Kruskal and Schwarzschild 1954. They investigated several simple systems including the system in which an ideal fluid is supported against gravity by a magnetic field (the initial model described in the last section). In Bernstein et al. 1958, Bernstein derives an energy principle that rigorously proves that the change in potential must be greater than zero for a system to be stable. This energy principle has been essential in establishing a <b>stability</b> <b>condition</b> for the possible instabilities of a specific configuration. In 1959, Thomas Gold attempted to use the concept of interchange motion to explain the circulation of plasma around the Earth, using data from Pioneer III published by James Van Allen. Gold also coined the term “magnetosphere” to describe “the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the Earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles.” Marshall Rosenthal and Conrad Longmire described in their 1957 paper how a flux tube in a planetary magnetic field accumulates charge because of opposing movement of the ions and electrons in the background plasma. Gradient, curvature and centrifugal drifts all send ions in the same direction along the planetary rotation meaning that there is a positive build-up on one side of the flux tube and a negative build-up on the other. The separation of charges established an electric field across the flux tube and therefore adds an E x B motion, sending the flux tube toward the planet. This mechanism supports our interchange instability framework, resulting in the injection of less dense gas radially inward. Since the Kruskal and Schwarzschild’s paper a tremendous amount of theoretical work has been accomplished that handle multi-dimensional configurations, varying boundary conditions and complicated geometries. The motivation for new technologies in World War II and the Cold War also directly led to the advanced rocketry and satellite technology developed in the space race. This boded well for experimentalists who now had the means and support to build satellites that could orbit the Earth. Pioneers like James Van Allen, Louis Frank and others in space physics were finally able to acquire in situ data from Earth’s magnetosphere. Ever since the establishment of NASA in 1958, the program has overseen the bulk of American space exploration. Dozens of unmanned missions have been completed and many are still ongoing. From inner earth orbit to the interstellar medium, these missions have become essential in our understanding of the planets and the properties of their magnetospheres. Without them, the study of interchange instability would be much more brief and much less developed. These unmanned missions, that have now reached every planet in our solar system, have enabled a more comprehensive understanding of interchange motions in Jupiter and Saturn’s magnetospheres. Jupiter has had two major orbital missions: Galileo (launched in 1989) and Juno (launched in 2011 and currently operating in orbit). Saturn currently has the Cassini-Huygens probe in orbit. Cassini was launched in 1997 and has been at Saturn since 2004.|$|E

5000|$|Let’s first {{consider}} the simple {{model of a}} plasma supported by a magnetic field B in a uniform gravitational field g. To simplify matters, assume that the internal energy {{of the system is}} zero such that static equilibrium may be obtained from the balance of the gravitational force and the magnetic field pressure on the boundary of the plasma. The change in the potential is then given by the equation:.If two adjacent flux tubes lying opposite along the boundary (one fluid tube and one magnetic flux tube) are interchanged the volume element doesn’t change and the field lines are straight. Therefore, the magnetic potential doesn’t change, but the gravitational potential changes since it was moved along the z axis. Since the change in is negative the potential is decreasing. A decreasing potential indicates a more energetically favorable system and consequently an instability. The origin of this instability is in the J × B forces that occur at the boundary between the plasma and magnetic field. At this boundary there are slight ripple-like perturbations in which the low points must have a larger current than the high points since at the low point more gravity is being supported against the gravity. The difference in current allows negative and positive charge to build up along the opposite sides of the valley. The charge build-up produces an E field between the hill and the valley. The accompanying E × B drifts are {{in the same direction as}} the ripple, amplifying the effect. This is what is physically meant by the “interchange” motion.These interchange motions also occur in plasmas that are in a system with a large centrifugal force. In a cylindrically symmetric plasma device, radial electric fields cause the plasma to rotate rapidly in a column around the axis. Acting opposite to the gravity in the simple model, the centrifugal force moves the plasma outward where the ripple-like perturbations (sometimes called “flute” instabilities) occur on the boundary. This is important for the study of the magnetosphere in which the co-rotational forces are stronger than the opposing gravity of the planet. Effectively, the less dense “bubbles” inject radially inward in this configuration. Without gravity or an inertial force, interchange instabilities can still occur if the plasma is in a curved magnetic field. If we assume the potential energy to be purely magnetic then the change in potential energy is:. If the fluid is incompressible then the equation can be simplified into [...] Since (to maintain pressure balance), the above equation shows that if the system is unstable. Physically, this means that if the field lines are toward the region of higher plasma density then the system is susceptible to interchange motions. To derive a more rigorous <b>stability</b> <b>condition,</b> the perturbations that cause an instability must be generalized. The momentum equation for a resistive MHD is linearized and then manipulated into a linear force operator. Due to purely mathematical reasons, it is then possible to split the analysis into two approaches: the normal mode method and the energy method. The normal mode method essentially looks for the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies and summing the solutions to form the general solution. The energy method is similar to the simpler approach outlined above where is found for any arbitrary perturbation in order to maintain the condition [...] These two methods are not exclusive and can be used together to establish a reliable diagnosis of the stability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the Fermat Calabi-Yau {{threefold}} and {{the theory}} of <b>stability</b> <b>conditions</b> [Bri 07], {{there have been two}} mathematical aims given by physical reasoning. One is that we should define <b>stability</b> <b>conditions</b> by central charges of quintic periods [Hos 04, Kon 12, KonSoi 13], which extend the Gamma class [KKP, Iri 09, Iri 11]. The other is that for well-motivated <b>stability</b> <b>conditions</b> on a derived Fukaya-type category, each stable object should be a Lagrangian [ThoYau]. We answer affirmatively to these aims with the simplest homological mir-ror symmetry (HMS for short) of the Fermat Calabi-Yau threefold [Oka 09, FutUed] and <b>stability</b> <b>conditions</b> of Bridgeland type, which we introduce. With HMS, we naturally obtain <b>stability</b> <b>conditions</b> of Bridgeland type by the mon-odromy around the Gepner point. As consequences, we obtain bases of quintic periods and the mirror map [CdGP] categorically, wall-crossings by quintic periods, and a quasimodular form [KanZag] attached to quintic periods by motivic Donaldson-Thomas in-variants [KonSoi 08]. The quasimodular form is of the quantum dilogarithm and of a mock modular form [Zag 06]...|$|R
