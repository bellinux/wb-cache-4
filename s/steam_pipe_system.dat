The dynamic effects are the discharging fluid and pipe whip on structures, systems or components. A pipe rupture can be caused in the <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>system</b> where a defect such as a crack exists. Multiple factors contribute to the initiation of pipe cracks during the plant’s life. Cracks may start microscopically small and over time, {{with the assistance of}} cyclic operation, fatigue may elongate the crack. When a steam pipe is cooled by water during an accident, steam condensate may accumulate and form slugs of water. This water will {{have an effect on the}} system termed condensation induced water hammer. The cause of the pipe rupture is not addressed in this dissertation. Pipe rupture can be considered to be either a circumferential or longitudinal break. For the purpose of this dissertation only a circumferential break will be considered. This research is based on the development of a pipe whip restraint structure to protect the plant environment during a steam pipe rupture event in a nuclear power plant. It focuses on a structural component required to restrain the dynamic energy to an acceptable level. Whip restraints used in the nuclear industry are typically honeycomb, U-bar and crush pipe types. In this dissertation only the U-bar and crush pipe whip restraints will be considered. The plant environment, with regards to pipe layout, plays a large role in determining the type of restraint to be used, whether it is U-bar or crush pipe. A whip towards the wall/structure will favor a crush pipe; a whip away from the wall/structure will favor a U-bar restraint. In this project the crush pipe is selected where the whip is towards a wall/structure. The crush pipe also represents a simpler design. First-order analysis is performed using the energy method to determine the conceptual geometry of the whipping component and the restraint geometry. Second-order analysis includes finite element analysis to verify the first-order results. In this dissertation the concept validation is done using LS-PrePost. for the pre- and post-processing while the analysis is performed using LS-DYNA ®. During the second-order analysis it was demonstrated that the energy is successfully absorbed by the crush pipe and thus the first-order analysis is considered adequate. Master...|$|E

40|$|An effective, {{in-service}} {{health monitoring}} system {{is needed to}} track water condensation in real time through the walls of <b>steam</b> <b>pipes.</b> The <b>system</b> is required to measure {{the height of the}} condensed water from outside the pipe, while operating at temperatures that are as high as 250 C. The system needs to account for the effects of water flow and cavitation. In addition, it is desired that the system does not require perforating the pipes and thereby reducing the structural integrity. Generally, <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> are used as part of the district heating system carrying steam from central power stations under the streets to heat, cool, or supply power to high-rise buildings and businesses. This system uses ultrasonic waves in pulse-echo and acquires reflected signal data. Via autocorrelation, it determines the water height while eliminating the effect of noise and multiple reflections from the wall of the <b>pipe.</b> The <b>system</b> performs nondestructive monitoring through the walls of <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> and automatically measures the height of condensed water while operating at the high-temperature conditions of 250 C. For this purpose, the ultrasonic pulse-echo method is used where the time-of-flight of the wave reflections inside the water are measured, and it is multiplied by the wave velocity to determine the height. The pulse-echo test consists of emitting ultrasonic wave pulses from a piezoelectric transducer and receiving the reflections from {{the top and bottom of}} the condensed water. A single transducer is used as a transmitter as well as the receiver of the ultrasonic waves. To obtain high resolution, a broadband transducer is used and the frequency can be in the range of 2. 25 to 10 MHz, providing sharp pulses in the time domain allowing for higher resolution in identifying the individual reflections...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2010, Valve {{released}} all {{of their}} major Source games on OS X, coinciding {{with the release of}} the Steam client on the same platform. Valve announced that all their future games will be released simultaneously for Windows and Mac. The first of Valve's games to support Linux was Team Fortress 2, the port released in October 2012 along with the closed beta of the Linux version of Steam. Both the OS X and Linux ports of the engine take advantage of OpenGL and are powered by SDL. During the process of porting, Valve rearranged most of the games released up to The Orange Box into separate, but parallel [...] "singleplayer" [...] and [...] "multiplayer" [...] branches. The game code to these branches was made public to mod developers in 2013, and they serve as the current stable release of Source designated for mods. Support for Valve's internal <b>Steam</b> <b>Pipe</b> distribution <b>system</b> as well as the Oculus Rift are included. In May 2014, Nvidia released ports of Portal and Half-Life 2 to their Tegra 4-based Android handheld game console Nvidia Shield.|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} {{industrial process}} to produce medium voltage electric cables based on EPDM consists of crosslinking by peroxides with high temperature steam (pressurized water vapor). Suboptimal material crosslinking is usually {{due to a}} decrease of the temperature along the vulcanization pipe. Temperature variations are connected to variations in <b>steam</b> pressure into <b>pipe</b> <b>system.</b> In the present paper a combined numerical and experimental approach to optimize the production process of medium voltage rubber insulated electric cables vulcanized with steam water is presented. The numerical part, discussed in an accompanying paper, {{is based on the}} utilization of Finite Elements and an optimization Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. Here, attention is focused on the experimental investigation. In particular, the final crosslinking degree is experimentally obtained by means of a DSC determination of non-decomposed peroxide from the external layer to the core of the cable insulation. The final task is to minimize the difference between numerically predicted and experimentally determined crosslinking degree using a steam temperature profile along the pipe to explain the variations. A preliminary evaluation of kinetic reaction constants of rubber cured with peroxides is here provided by means of a previously presented kinetic model...|$|R

The test results indicate that acoustic emission count rates show reasonable correlation with crack propagation rates for applied stress ratios.
