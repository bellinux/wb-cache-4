5|$|In the <b>second</b> <b>step,</b> {{the crystal}} {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the <b>second</b> <b>step</b> (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E

5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be {{less than or equal to}} the greatest common divisor g. In the <b>second</b> <b>step,</b> it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The <b>second</b> <b>step</b> consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} used {{approach}} to multiple sequence alignments uses a heuristic search known as progressive technique (also known as the hierarchical or tree method) developed by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1984. Progressive alignment builds up a final MSA by combining pairwise alignments beginning with the most similar pair and progressing to the most distantly related. All progressive alignment methods require two stages: a first stage in which {{the relationships between the}} sequences are represented as a tree, called a guide tree, and a <b>second</b> <b>step</b> in which the MSA is built by adding the sequences sequentially to the growing MSA according to the guide tree. The initial guide tree is determined by an efficient clustering method such as neighbor-joining or UPGMA, and may use distances {{based on the number of}} identical two letter sub-sequences (as in FASTA rather than a dynamic programming alignment).|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a <b>second</b> <b>step,</b> he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E
5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the <b>second</b> <b>step,</b> a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E

25|$|This {{speculation}} {{also involves}} theories concerning whether Mallory and Irvine could {{have managed to}} climb the <b>Second</b> <b>Step.</b> Òscar Cadiach {{was the first to}} climb it in 1985 free and rated it V+. Conrad Anker led an experiment to free climb this section without using the “Chinese ladder” for assistance, since that equipment was not installed in 1924. In 1999, he did not manage a complete free climb as he put one foot briefly on the ladder when it blocked the only available foothold. At that time he rated the difficulty of the <b>Second</b> <b>Step</b> as 5.10—well outside of Mallory's capability. In June 2007, Anker returned {{as a member of the}} Altitude Everest Expedition 2007, and with Leo Houlding successfully free-climbed the <b>Second</b> <b>Step,</b> after removing the “Chinese ladder” (which was later replaced). Houlding rated the climb at 5.9, just within Mallory's estimated capabilities. Theo Fritsche climbed the step free solo on-sight in 2001 and rated it V+.|$|E
