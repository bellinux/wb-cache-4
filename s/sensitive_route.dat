30|$|The German Environment Agency {{initiated}} {{a project to}} elucidate the entry of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in food related to environmental contamination. This paper summarizes the most important findings. Food products from farm animals sensitive to dioxin/PCB exposure—suckling calves and laying hens housed outdoor—can exceed EU maximum levels at soil concentrations that have previously been considered as safe. Maximum permitted levels can already be exceeded in beef/veal when soil is contaminated around 5  ng PCB-TEQ/kg dry matter (dm). For eggs/broiler, this can occur at a concentration of PCDD/Fs in soil below 5  ng PCDD/F–PCB-TEQ/kg dm. Egg consumers—especially young children—can easily exceed health-based guidance values (TDI). The soil–chicken egg exposure pathway {{is probably the most}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>route</b> for human exposure to both dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs from soil and needs to be considered for soil guidelines. The study also found that calves from suckler cow herds are most prone to the impacts of dl-PCB contamination due to the excretion/accumulation via milk. PCB (and PCDD/F) intake for free-range cattle stems from feed and soil. Daily dl-PCB intake for suckler cow herds must in average be less than 2  ng PCB-TEQ/day. This translates to a maximum concentration in grass of 0.2  ng PCB-TEQ/kg dm which is less than 1 / 6 of the current EU maximum permitted level. This review compiles sources for PCDD/Fs and PCBs relevant to environmental contamination in respect to food safety. It also includes considerations on assessment of emerging POPs.|$|E

Existing solutions for providing anonymity such as mix networks are not well suited to applications like VoIP, SSH, and gaming which require low communication latency. This paper investigates the problem of on-demand construction of QoS <b>sensitive</b> <b>routes</b> on anonymizing networks using the VoIP application. We first describe triangulation based timing analysis attacks on shortest path route set up protocols. We show that even when a small fraction (∼ 1 %) of the network is malicious, the adversary can infer the source (caller) with reasonably high probability. Second, we describe random walk based route set up protocols that significantly improve anonymity while satisfying latencybased QoS guarantees. We describe a prototype implementation of our proposal and show that our protocols can significantly reduce the probability of inferring the caller. We present a detailed experimental evaluation to demonstrate our attacks and quantify the performance and scalability of our guards. I...|$|R

There is {{a growing body of}} literature examining water-related discourses which identifies the ability of powerful actors and institutions to influence policy. Concern about the effects of future climate change has featured strongly in research on the Nile River for several decades. It is therefore timely to consider whether and how these concerns are reflected in regional policy documents and policy discourse. This study analyses discourse framings of {{water resources}} management and climate change in policy documents (27, published between 2001 and 2013) and as elicited in interviews (38) with water managers in the EQNB. Three main discursive framings are identified which are present in the discourses on both subjects: a problem oriented environmental risk frame; and two solution oriented frames, on governance and infrastructure development. Climate change discourse only emerges as a common topic around 2007. The framings found in the {{water resources management}} discourse and the climate change discourse are almost identical, suggesting that discursive framings were adopted from the former for use in the latter. We infer that the climate change discourse may have offered a less politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>route</b> to circumvent political sensitivities around water allocation and distribution between riparian countries in the EQNB. However, the climate change discourse does not offer a lasting solution to the more fundamental political dispute over water allocation. Moreover, in cases where the climate change discourse is subsumed within a water resources management discourse there are dangers it will not fully address the needs of effective adaptation...|$|E

Although the primary cause of PD is still unknown, epidemiological studies have revealed that its incidence is increased in consequence of exposure to certain environmental toxins. In this study, most of the impairments presented by C 57 BL/ 6 mice infused with a single intranasal (i. n.) administration of the proneurotoxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1 mg/nostril) were similar to those observed during the early phase of PD, when a moderate loss of nigral dopamine neurons results in olfactory and memory deficits with no major motor impairments. Such infusion decreased the levels of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the olfactory bulb, striatum, and substantia nigra by means of apoptotic mechanisms, reducing dopamine concentration in different brain structures such as olfactory bulb, striatum, and prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. These findings reinforce the notion that the olfactory system represents a particularly <b>sensitive</b> <b>route</b> for the transport of neurotoxins into the central nervous system that {{may be related to the}} etiology of PD. These results also provide new insights in experimental models of PD, indicating that the i. n. administration of MPTP represents a valuable mouse model for the study of the early stages of PD and for testing new therapeutic strategies to restore sensorial and cognitive processes in PD.

40|$|DNA charge {{transport}} (CT) chemistry {{has received}} considerable attention by scientific researchers {{over the past}} 15 years since our first provocative publication on long range CT in a DNA assembly. 1, 2 This interest, shared by physicists, chemists and biologists, reflects the potential of DNA CT to provide a <b>sensitive</b> <b>route</b> for signaling, whether {{in the construction of}} nanoscale biosensors or as an enzymatic tool to detect damage in the genome. Research into DNA CT chemistry began as a quest to determine whether the DNA double helix, a macromolecular assembly in solution with π-stacked base pairs, might share conductive characteristics with π-stacked solids. Physicists carried out sophisticated experiments to measure the conductivity of DNA samples, but the means to connect discrete DNA assemblies into the devices to gauge conductivity varied, as did the conditions under which conductivities were determined. Chemists constructed DNA assemblies to measure hole and electron transport in solution using a variety of hole and electron donors. Here, too, DNA CT was seen to depend upon the connections, or coupling, between donors and the DNA base pair stack. Importantly, these experiments have resolved the debate over whether DNA CT is possible. Moreover these studies have shown that DNA CT, irrespective of the oxidant or reductant used to initiate the chemistry, can occur over long molecular distances but can be exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in the base pair stack. Here we review some of the critical characteristics of DNA charge transport chemistry, taking examples from a range of systems, and consider these characteristics {{in the context of their}} mechanistic implications. This review is not intended to be exhaustive but instead to be illustrative. For instance, we describe studies involving measurements in solution using pendant photooxidants to inject holes, conductivity studies with covalently modified assemblies, and electrochemical studies on DNA-modified electrodes. We do not focus in detail on the differences amongst these constructs but instead on their similarities. It is the similarity among these various systems that allows us to consider different mechanisms to describe DNA CT. Thus we review also the various mechanisms for DNA CT that have been put forth and attempt to reconcile these mechanistic proposals with the many disparate measurements of DNA CT. Certainly the debate among researchers has shifted from "is DNA CT possible?" to "how does it work?". This review intends to explore this latter question in detail...|$|E

Technological advancements and developments in gathering geotechnical information on our working environment have given birth {{to the development of}} new methods which will prevent problems that may have emerged due to the use of traditional methods during the construction of infrastructure facilities. One of these new methods is trenchless technology which is becoming increasingly popular in the infrastructure construction industry. One of its processes, the pipejaking process, is of special importance in busy urban centres and densely populated living quarters as it has proved to be the most sustainable method for working in such environments and for global use. The name of this process is trenchless technology. There is an increasing demand for infrastructure systems, especially in cities, because of increasing populations and varying lifestyles, and in the areas around cities which are environmentally <b>sensitive.</b> <b>Routes</b> of infrastructure (pipelines) to be constructed have many obstructions such as motorways, buildings, railways, rivers, creeks, and canals. The pipejacking process, a trenchless technology to overcome these problems and obstructions, has been achieving an important scope of application in Turkey {{and the rest of the}} world. Infrastructure facilities planned to be constructed by the application of this system can be built under every kind of ground condition in a correct, swift, and economic manner, without needing an open excavation and its associated traffic problems and conditions that may cause danger to human life and property. Within the context of this study, the collector line, constructed in S¸ ile district by the pipejacking process(which is 1535 m in length and 800 mm in diameter), was examined, and jacking force length graphics were prepared with the use of jacking force records obtained from the machine. After analysing these graphics, change of coefficients of α adhesion was researched and, for use at cohesioned grounds, an α value was suggested in order to predict friction resistance and accordingly possible jacking force values that may be faced. First, with the assistance of the Plaxis 3 D Tunnel Program, considering land conditions, the examined line was modelled. Then, stress values resulting from this modelling and graphic analyses were compared, and observed harmonies or inharmonies were discussed. Lastly, parameters that are effective on these harmonies or inharmonies were defined. In addition, considering jacking forces and stress values observed where bentonite is whether used or not, the lubricant’s effect on the jacking action was examined. Within the context of this study, stoppages, lubrication during jacking process, and their effects on the jacking force and stresses were analysed.

40|$|To my {{wife and}} family Side-channel attacks are a {{powerful}} technique against cryptographic implementations. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} design efficient and effective countermeasures. Mainly two approaches have been suggested to reduce side-channel leakage, namely masking and hiding. The former modifies the cryptographic algorithm by blinding val-ues with random masks before their computation. This requires a true random number generator and also depends on the order of the masking. The latter is usually realized by implementing a kind of dual-rail logic style that aims at equalizing the power consumption level, thereby minimizing possible leakages. This approach almost always results in circuits that need to be developed and securely manufactured separately {{from the rest of the}} circuit to prevent adversarial leakages.

40|$|Despite the {{relative}} recent move towards inherent safe materials, the relentless drive of consumerism requires increased quantities of dangerous goods to be manufactured, transported, stored and used year on year. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of road transport systems is {{to be considered a}} strategic goal in particular in those countries, like Italy, in which 80 % of goods are transported by this means. In this paper, we face the risk from dangerous good transport by presenting a site-oriented framework for risk assessment and developing a theoretical approach for emergency planning and optimization. In the first step, we collected field data on a pilot highway and developed a database useful to allow a realistic evaluation of the accident frequency on a given route, by means of multivariate statistical analysis. To this end, we considered both inherent factors (such as tunnels, bend radii, height gradient, slope etc), meteorological factors, and traffic factors (traffic frequency of tank truck, dangerous good truck etc.) suitable to modify the standard national accident frequency. By applying the results to a pilot area, making reference to flammable and explosive scenarios, we performed a risk assessment <b>sensitive</b> to <b>route</b> features and population exposed. The results show that the risk associated to the transport of hazardous materials, in some highway stretches, can be at the boundary of the acceptability level of risk set down by the well known F/N curves established in the Netherlands. On this basis, in the subsequent step, we developed a theoretical approach, based on the graph theory, to plan optimal emergency actions. The effectiveness of an emergency planning can normally be evaluated in term of system quickness and reliability. As a case study, we applied the developed approach to identify optimal consistency and localisation in the pilot area of “prompt action vehicles”, properly equipped, quick to move and ready for every eventuality. Applying this method results in an unambiguous and consistent selection criterion that allows reduction of intervention time, in connection with technical and economic optimisation of emergency equipment...|$|R

The {{source of the}} purinergic agonists acting in the ciliary epithelium, as in many epithelial tissues, is unknown. We found that the fluorescent ATP marker quinacrine stained rabbit and bovine ciliary epithelia but not the nerve fibers in the ciliary bodies. Cultured bovine pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells also stained intensely when incubated with quinacrine. Hypotonic stimulation of cultured epithelial cells increased the extracellular ATP concentration by 3 -fold; this measurement underestimates actual release as the cells also displayed ecto-ATPase activity. The hypotonically triggered increase in ATP was inhibited by the Cl−-channel blocker 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) in both cell types. In contrast, the P-glycoprotein inhibitors tamoxifen and verapamil and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blockers glybenclamide and diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate did not affect ATP release from either cell type. This pharmacological profile suggests that ATP release is not restricted to P-glycoprotein or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, but can proceed through a <b>route</b> <b>sensitive</b> to NPPB. ATP release also was triggered by ionomycin through a different NPPB-insensitive mechanism, inhibitable by the calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase II inhibitor KN- 62.

Results are compared with detailed chemical models that emphasize the coupling of gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry. Molecules that are particularly <b>sensitive</b> to different <b>routes</b> of formation and that may be useful in distinguishing between a variety of environments and histories are outlined. In the cold, low-density prestellar cores, radicals and long unsaturated carbon chains are enhanced. During the cold collapse phase, most species freeze out onto the grains in the high-density inner region. Once young stars ignite, their surroundings are heated through radiation and/or shocks, whereupon new chemical characteristics appear. Evaporation of ices drives a “hot core” chemistry rich in organic molecules, whereas shocks propagating through the dense envelope release both refractory and volatile grain material, resulting in prominent SiO, OH, and H_ 2 O emission. The role of future instrumentation in further developing these chemical and temporal diagnostics is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{resolved}} {{general circulation}} models (GCMs) now generate realistic flow fields, and have revealed how <b>sensitive</b> larval drift <b>routes</b> are to vertical positioning {{in the water}} column. Sensible representation of behavioural processes then becomes essential to generate reliable patterns of environmental exposure (growth and survival), larval drift trajectories and dispersal. Existing individual-based models involving larval fish allow individuals to vary only in their attributes such as spatial coordinates, and not in their inherited behavioural strategies or phenotypes. We illustrate the interaction between short-term behaviour and longer-term dispersal consequences applying a model of larval cod Gadus morhua drifting in a GCM, and show how variations in swimming behaviour influence growth and dispersal. We recommend a deep integration of oceanography and behavioural ecology. First, {{we need to understand}} the causes and survival value of behaviours of larval fish, framed in terms of behavioural ecology. Second, we need practices to address how drift and dispersal of offspring are generating spawning strategies (timing and location) of adults, using life history theory. Third, the relative importance of local growth and mortality versus the need to drift to particular areas depend strongly on the mobility of organisms at the time of settling, or the spatial fitness-landscape. The field of ‘individual-based ecology’ provides sound methods to approach this interface between evolutionary theory and physical oceanography...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBecause of its potent {{ability to}} induce apoptosis, {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) {{is an attractive}} candidate as an oncolytic virus for tumor therapy. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} VSV selectively infects tumor cells due to defects in their antiviral responses making them more susceptible to VSV infection than normal cells. We tested this hypothesis in the prostate tumor system by comparing LNCaP and PC- 3 prostate tumor cells to benign human prostatic epithelial cells from patient prostatectomy specimens. We compared the cell killing ability of a recombinant virus containing a wild-type (wt) M protein (rwt) and an isogenic M protein mutant virus (rM 51 R-M) that induces interferon (IFN) in infected cells and should display a greater selectivity for tumor cells. Our results showed that in single-cycle infection experiments, LNCaP cells were sensitive to killing by both wt and mutant viruses, while PC- 3 cells were highly resistant to VSV-induced cell killing. LNCaP and benign prostate cells were similarly susceptible to both viruses, indicating that normal prostate cells are not inherently resistant to killing by VSV. In each of the cell lines, the rM 51 R-M virus induced similar levels of apoptosis to rwt virus, showing that the M protein does not {{play a significant role in}} apoptosis induction by VSV in these cells. In multiple-cycle infection experiments, LNCaP cells were more sensitive than benign prostatic epithelial cells to virus-induced cell killing by rM 51 R-M virus, but not rwt virus. Both viruses were equally effective at reducing LNCaP tumor volume in vivo following intratumoral and intravenous inoculation in nude mice, while PC- 3 tumors were resistant to VSV treatment. None of the mice treated with rM 51 R-M virus died as a result of virus infection, while 50 – 71 % of mice treated with rwt virus succumbed to virus infection. Similarly, when inoculated by the more <b>sensitive</b> intranasal <b>route,</b> the rM 51 R-M virus was less pathogenic than the rwt virus from which it was derived. These results indicate that M protein mutant viruses are superior candidates as oncolytic viruses for therapies of prostate tumors, but future strategies for use of VSV will require testing individual tumors for their susceptibility to virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of {{gases and}} {{particles}} from ocean-going ships {{may have a}} major impact on both photochemistry of the marine boundary layer and the biogeochemistry of the surface ocean. Throughout large regions of the ocean, ship emissions of SO 2 and sulfate aerosols greatly exceed the natural DMS-borne sulfur emissions. Ship emissions must, therefore, be taken into account in estimates of global climate forcing by sulfate aerosols (Activity 1. 3 of the SOLAS Science and Implementation Plan). Ship emissions are also a significant source of atmospheric nitrogen, and the deposition of this nitrogen into marine ecosystems might affect marine productivity (Activity 1. 5). Finally, ship emissions of gaseous hydrocarbons and carbonaceous aerosol particles may impact both gas phase photochemistry and aerosol radiative properties over the oceans. The effects of ship emissions on atmospheric photochemistry include the production of ozone in regions that are usually sinks for ozone and the pollution-induced release of reactive chlorine from sea salt (Activity 1. 2). The photochemical and radiative impacts of ship emissions may persist considerably longer than the lifetime of the ship plume itself. Ship traffic has increased significantly in recent years and is projected to keep increasing. In the Arctic Ocean, which is a particularly <b>sensitive</b> region, new <b>routes</b> are becoming available for international shipping due to decreasing sea ice cover in summer. Open ocean ship emissions are currently largely unregulated and shipping often relies on very dirty fuels that cannot be used for land-based transport.
