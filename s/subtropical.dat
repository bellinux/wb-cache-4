5|$|Since 2002, <b>subtropical</b> storms {{have been}} {{assigned}} names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named <b>subtropical</b> storm since the policy change to not achieve full tropical cyclone status. In 1972 and 1973, four <b>subtropical</b> storms were named using the Phonetic alphabet, while all other <b>subtropical</b> cyclones remained unnamed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subtropical</b> {{cyclones}} with hurricane-force {{winds of}} greater than 33m/s, (119km/h, 64knots, or 74mph) are not officially {{recognized by the}} National Hurricane Center. Once a <b>subtropical</b> storm intensifies enough to have hurricane-force winds, then it is automatically assumed to have become a fully tropical hurricane. Despite this however, {{prior to the start}} of modern policies two systems in the Atlantic hurricane database attained hurricane-force winds as a <b>subtropical</b> cyclone; a <b>subtropical</b> storm in 1968, and a <b>subtropical</b> storm in 1979.|$|E
5|$|A {{circulation}} {{began to}} form on June 18 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings. It was declared <b>Subtropical</b> Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall {{on the morning of}} June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained <b>subtropical</b> storm status over land. The storm was classified as <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One by the National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name <b>subtropical</b> storms. The <b>subtropical</b> storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became distorted. The <b>subtropical</b> storm peaked at 70mph winds (110km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984mbar (29.07inHg). The <b>subtropical</b> storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes the same day.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a <b>subtropical</b> depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad <b>subtropical</b> low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the <b>subtropical</b> depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the <b>subtropical</b> depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E
5|$|A <b>subtropical</b> cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some {{characteristics}} of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although <b>subtropical</b> storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become <b>subtropical</b> during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|A {{system is}} {{designated}} as a tropical depression or a <b>subtropical</b> depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots (50km/h, 32mph). Should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots (65km/h, 40mph) {{then it will be}} classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the Sub Regional Center in Mauritius or Madagascar. No matter how strong a <b>subtropical</b> system is in this basin, it is always {{designated as a}} <b>subtropical</b> depression.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island has a <b>subtropical</b> climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, Lord Howe Island has a Humid <b>subtropical</b> climate (Cfa).|$|E
5|$|March 10, 2011 - Before {{becoming}} a <b>subtropical</b> cyclone, <b>Subtropical</b> Storm Arani produces torrential rains over Brazil. Damage is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, Ana {{became the}} second <b>subtropical</b> cyclone on {{record in the}} Atlantic basin {{in the month of}} April, after a <b>subtropical</b> storm in 1992. After {{attaining}} tropical characteristics, it became the first tropical storm on record in the month of April, and was among the earliest forming tropical or <b>subtropical</b> cyclones in the Atlantic basin.|$|E
5|$|Six storms {{during the}} season had <b>subtropical</b> {{characteristics}} {{at some point in}} their track, those being <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One, Tropical Storm Cesar, Hurricane Hortense, Hurricane Josephine, Hurricane Klaus, and Hurricane Lili.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a below-average season that produced six named tropical cyclones. The season officially started on June 1, 1992, and finished on November 30; however, <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One formed outside the official timeline on April 21. <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One {{was the first}} recorded <b>subtropical</b> cyclone to form in April since the recording of <b>subtropical</b> cyclones began in 1968. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season.|$|E
5|$|The South Atlantic {{environment}} for formation of <b>subtropical</b> cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures, yet <b>subtropical</b> cyclogenesis is regularly {{observed in the}} open ocean in the South Atlantic. A second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for South Atlantic <b>subtropical</b> cyclones: lee cyclogenesis {{in the region of}} the Brazil Current.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Florence {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} which developed in late October along a stationary front located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The low gradually detached from the front and began developing convective banding features. The system was not fully tropical as the strongest winds were recorded a couple hundred miles from the center, leading to the system being classified a <b>subtropical</b> cyclone on the morning of November 2. Minor intensification followed shortly after and the <b>subtropical</b> depression was upgraded to a <b>subtropical</b> storm. This was based on ship reports of 40mph (65km/h) sustained winds associated with the system. By November 3, the storm became slightly disorganized and was downgraded to a <b>subtropical</b> depression. By the afternoon, the <b>subtropical</b> system began to undergo a transition from a <b>subtropical</b> system to tropical system. Later that day, the storm was classified Tropical Depression Eleven while located 875mi (1,400km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression was moving towards the northwest at 8mph (13km/h) and the same general motion was expected as a large upper-level low situated over the system was forecast to move towards the northeast, leading to Eleven moving around the periphery of the low.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Gilda was notable {{as being}} the first {{observed}} tropical cyclone to transition into a <b>subtropical</b> cyclone; several <b>subtropical</b> cyclones have undergone tropical cyclogenesis, but never the opposite. Since Gilda, a few other storms accomplished the feat. In 1980, a tropical depression dissipated, reformed as a <b>subtropical</b> depression, and later became Hurricane Georges over the open Atlantic Ocean. The next year, Tropical Storm Jose became <b>subtropical</b> {{near the end of}} its duration, and in 1984, Hurricane Klaus became a <b>subtropical</b> storm over the western Atlantic Ocean. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison, after causing devastating flooding in Texas, became a <b>subtropical</b> storm over the Gulf of Mexico and moved across much of the southeastern United States. In 2011, Tropical Storm Lee transitioned into a <b>subtropical</b> storm while approaching Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|A <b>subtropical</b> cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some {{characteristics}} of a tropical and an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed <b>subtropical</b> {{storm in}} early-December of the 2013 {{hurricane}} season.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a <b>subtropical</b> storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the <b>subtropical</b> storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become <b>Subtropical</b> Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{under the}} <b>subtropical</b> ridge are the doldrums, or horse {{latitude}}s, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the <b>subtropical</b> ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to rough}} surf from the {{precursor}} low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory {{for much of}} the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a <b>subtropical</b> cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch {{from the mouth of the}} Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a <b>subtropical</b> depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued {{for much of the}} South Carolina coastline.|$|E
5|$|Gustav {{spent the}} early part of its {{existence}} as a <b>subtropical</b> storm, and was the first such storm to be named from the current lists by the National Hurricane Center. Previously, <b>subtropical</b> storms were not given names. The cyclone was also the latest-forming first hurricane of the season since 1941.|$|E
5|$|Gustav was {{the first}} <b>subtropical</b> storm {{to be given a}} name from the current name lists by the National Hurricane Center. Prior to the 2002 season, Atlantic <b>subtropical</b> storms were either not named or given a number from a {{separate}} numbering list than tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island has a humid <b>subtropical</b> climate.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fran, also {{referred}} initially as <b>Subtropical</b> Storm Bravo, was a long-tracked Category 1 hurricane that caused little damage during its existence in early October 1973. Originating from a tropical wave that developed {{off the coast}} of Hispaniola on October1, the precursor to Fran slowly developing {{during the first week of}} October. By October4, a surface low formed within the system and convective activity increased. The system was eventually classified as a <b>subtropical</b> depression on October8 and was upgraded to <b>Subtropical</b> Storm Bravo shortly thereafter. Bravo became increasingly tropical throughout the day as it intensified. Following a reconnaissance mission into the storm on October10, it was deemed fully tropical and upgraded to a hurricane, at which time it was renamed Fran.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} Indian Ocean, <b>subtropical</b> cyclones are also named once winds reach tropical storm, or gale, force.|$|E
5|$|June 19, 1982– <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One brushes the {{coastline}} and causes some minor flooding due to locally moderate precipitation.|$|E
5|$|June 26, 1974– The first <b>subtropical</b> {{storm of}} the season brushes the {{coastline}} with light rainfall.|$|E
5|$|May 23, 1976- <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One strikes near Saint Marks, {{producing}} {{slightly above}} normal tides, minor beach erosion, and beneficial precipitation.|$|E
5|$|May 24, 1976– <b>Subtropical</b> Storm One drops light {{rainfall}} {{near the}} coastline as parallels the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a <b>subtropical</b> climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid <b>subtropical</b> climate (Cfa). The main {{features}} of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|Months {{after the}} {{hurricane}} season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review {{of the season and}} its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed <b>subtropical</b> storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm corethe hallmark of a <b>subtropical</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the <b>subtropical</b> ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the <b>subtropical</b> ridge shifts due to El Niño, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the <b>subtropical</b> ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the <b>subtropical</b> ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|November 12, 1981– A <b>subtropical</b> Storm {{produces}} coastal {{flooding and}} beach erosion along the East Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|November 15, 1981- A <b>subtropical</b> storm slowly {{moves through}} the western Atlantic, causing higher than normal tides along the Delaware coastline.|$|E
5|$|November, 1981- An unnamed <b>subtropical</b> storm {{produces}} coastal {{flooding and}} beach erosion {{along the eastern}} coastline while located over the open Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|October 1, 1969– <b>Subtropical</b> Depression One {{hits the}} western Florida Panhandle. Its effects, if any, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|October 8, 1974– The fourth <b>subtropical</b> {{storm of}} the season {{produces}} rainfall in the eastern portion of the state as it parallels offshore.|$|E
