2500|$|Rheinmetall {{designed}} an anti-tank cannon {{using their}} [...] "High-Low Pressure System" [...] that fired a standard general-purpose HE 8.1-cm mortar bomb {{which had been}} modified to function as an anti-tank round with a shaped charge. [...] Normally, a mortar bomb cannot be fired from a cannon, because its thin walls can not endure the high stress forces upon firing from a cannon. [...] The 8.1-cm round was mounted on a rod which was fixed to a round steel plate with eight holes in it. [...] A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> held the round to the rod. [...] The round and the plate were fitted {{at the mouth of}} a cut-down cannon shell casing which contained two propellant bags. [...] On firing, the pressure would build up in the shell casing, which along with the reinforced breech acted as the [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] and bled out the steel plate holes at half the pressure to the thinner walled cannon barrel which acted as the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". [...] Unlike standard cannon, in which the propellant [...] "kicks" [...] the projectile out the barrel with an almost instant acceleration to maximum muzzle velocity, the Rheinmetall concept [...] "shoved" [...] the projectile out the barrel at a constantly increasing muzzle velocity. [...] There was recoil, but nowhere near the recoil of the 5-cm and 7.5-cm anti-tank cannons being used at that time by the German forces, which required a heavy constructed carriage, and both a heavy and complex hydraulic recoil-mechanism as well as a muzzle brake to contain the massive recoil on firing. The Rheinmetall solution required only a lightweight recoil-unit and muzzle brake.|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} of a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> is selected and treated {{so that it}} is relatively resistant to fatigue (material). That is, when subjected to small forces, each one insufficient to break the pin, the pin does not retain damage.

40|$|Coaracy Nunes was {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the Amazon region, being located in Araguari River, Amapa State, Brazil. The plant operates since 1976, presenting now a nominal capacity of 78 MW. The <b>shear</b> <b>pins,</b> which are installed in the turbine hydraulic arms to control the wicket gate and regulate the water flow into the turbine blades, suffered several breakdowns since 2004. These <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are made of an ASTM 410 stainless steel and were designed to break by a shear overload of 120 kN. Fractographic investigation of the pins, however, revealed two types of fracture topographies: a region of stable crack propagation area, with non-pronounced striation and secondary cracks; and a region of unstable propagation, featuring elongated dimples. These {{results indicated that the}} stable crack propagation occurred by fatigue (bidirectional bending), which was nucleated at machining marks under high nominal load. Finite element analysis was carried out using two loading conditions (pure shear and a combination of shear and bending) and the results indicated that the presence of a bending stress strongly increased the stress concentration factor (85 % rise in the shear stress and 130 % rise in the Von Mises stress). Misalignment during <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> assembly associated with vibration might have promoted the premature failure of the shear by bending fatigue. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The {{principle}} while well {{rooted in}} chemical equilibrium and extended into economic theory, {{can also be}} used in describing mechanical systems in that the system put under stress will respond in a way such as to reduce or minimize that stress. Moreover, the response will generally be via the mechanism that most easily relieves that stress. <b>Shear</b> <b>pins</b> and other such sacrificial devices are design elements that protect systems against stress applied in undesired manners to relieve it so as to prevent more extensive damage to the entire system, a practical engineering application of Le Chatelier's principle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Segment {{floating}} is {{a common}} problem met {{in the construction of}} large-diameter crossing-river shield tunnel. The factors affecting segment floating are discussed first and analyzed by numerical simulation, including the properties of grouting material, the speed of shield tunneling, grouting pressure difference, the tunnel longitudinal stiffness, frictional force between segment rings and weight of the supporting system. The simulation results indicate that segment floating will reduce by shortening slurry’s initial solidification time, slowing shielding speed, improving the tunnel longitudinal stiffness as well as increasing the frictional force between segment rings. And some measures are given such as applying new rapid-setting slurries, <b>shear</b> <b>pins,</b> rubber mats with high friction coefficient and pre-stressed bolts...|$|R
50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|R
50|$|In {{the role}} as a {{conditional}} operator, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> {{will be used to}} prevent a mechanical device from operating before the criteria for operation are met. A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> gives a distinct threshold for the force required for operation. It is very cheap and easy to produce delivering a very high reliability and predictable tolerance. They are almost maintenance-free and can remain ready for operation for years with little to no decrease in reliability. Shear pins are only useful for a single operating cycle, after each operation they have to be replaced.|$|E
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the {{conveyor}} system to drive the chain. Conveyor sprockets typically have an odd number of teeth although sprockets with an even number have become more prevalent over the last thirty years. Most sprockets are made from fabricated steel and are parallel or taper keyed to a through shaft. Conveyor sprockets are also available in double pitch and <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> varieties. Double pitch sprockets wear evenly and offer a longer service life than standard sprockets. <b>Shear</b> <b>pin</b> sprockets break when overloaded, stopping the conveyor and saving considerable expense and downtime.|$|E

In this way, {{the failure of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> will physically separate the aircraft and the tractor. The design may be such that the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> will have several different causes of failure - towbar rotation about its long axis, sudden braking or acceleration, excessive steering force, etc. - all of which could otherwise be extremely damaging to the aircraft.|$|E

Egan, 'A {{sensitivity}} analysis of 3 -dimensional restoration techniques using vertical and inclined shear constructions', Tectonophysics, Vol. 269, Issues 1 - 2, January 1997, pp. 33 - 50, DOI: [URL] (96) 00099 - 6. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. The restoration of cross sections in extensional settings is commonly {{carried out with}} simple shear constructions which use either vertical or inclined shear geometrical construction techniques. These techniques assume plane strain and that the X and Z principal finite strain axes are contained within {{the plane of the}} cross-section. In 2 -dimensional balanced cross sections the displacement vector is, of necessity, assumed to be in the plane of the section. In 3 -dimensional restoration the main components are the horizontal displacement vector (heave), the deformation plane that contains the X and Z principal strain axes in plane strain deformation and the vertical/inclined <b>shear</b> angle (<b>shear</b> <b>pins)</b> parallel to which the hanging wall deforms during translation. During 3 -dimensional restoration it is possible to vary the orientation of the displacement vector and <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> in both azimuth and plunge. We can therefore test the sensitivity of artificial models, or natural examples, to variation in restoring parameters. The examples used here show that restorations are extremely sensitive to the shear angle chosen for the hanging wall, {{and in the case of}} an oblique ramp model and a natural fault example, to the movement direction assumed for the restoration. Using map view visualisation of faulted hanging-wall surfaces it is possible to obtain a good estimate of the original slip vector which would not be apparent from 2 -D sections by matching hanging-wall and footwall cut-offs. Using this 3 -D approach it is possible to minimise errors in restoration which result from erroneous restoring slip vectors. Any information on the angle of simple shear deformation of the hanging wall during deformation should be used when restoring the 3 -D surface or cross-section...|$|R

50|$|This type of tool can be {{extended}} and closed rapidly to induce a mechanical shock to the tool string.

The operator can use the jars to <b>shear</b> the <b>pins</b> at a predetermined depth.

40|$|AbstractGeosynthetic Reinforced Segmental Retaining Walls (GR-SRWs) are {{developing}} as well recognized earth retaining structures for their manifold economic and technical advantages. It {{is a matter}} of great concern that still now a huge volume of natural coarse aggregate is used as filler in GR-SRWs, thus depleting natural resources and presenting a challenge for sustainable development. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of recycled coarse aggregates (RCAs) used as alternative granular infills in hollow facing column. As granular infills, two types of recycled aggregates were used along with natural coarse aggregates (NCAs). Recycled aggregates were primarily selected based on the grading of the source waste concretes to investigate its effect on the frictional behavior of recycled aggregates used as infillers. Purely frictional capacity of I-Block infilled with recycled aggregates was compared to those infilled by fresh aggregates. To eliminate the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> on interface <b>shear</b> capacity of I-Block system infilled with gravels, none were used in purely frictional shear. A series of direct shear tests was performed using a specially designed and fabricated direct shear apparatus to assess the frictional behavior of infilled blocks under different normal loading conditions. The tests were conducted following the exiting ASTM and National Concrete Masonry Association (NCMA) test protocols. The test results were outlined in the form of shear stress–displacement relationship to compare the effect of recycled aggregate against the fresh aggregate. Shear capacity envelopes were also plotted using Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion to find out the angle of friction for each case. Test results reveal that the angle of friction of the blocks infilled with the recycled aggregate is almost equal to those with the fresh aggregate. The results also show that compressive strength of the source waste concretes has a little or no effect on the frictional performance of recycled concrete aggregates used in facing units...|$|R
