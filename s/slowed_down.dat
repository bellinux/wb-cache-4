40|$|We {{study the}} <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of {{particle}} beams {{passing through the}} dusty plasma with power-law kappa-distributions. Three plasma components, electrons, ions and dust particles, can have different kappa-parameter. We derive the deceleration factor (the velocity moment equation) and the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> time of a test particle, and numerically study the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> properties of an electron beam, a proton beam and a dust particle beam, respectively, in the kappa-distributed dusty plasma. We show that the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> properties of particle beams depend strongly on the kappa-parameters of the plasma components, and the dust component plays a dominant role in the <b>slowing</b> <b>down.</b> And the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> also depends on mass and charge of the dust particles in the dusty plasma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 2 ̆ 7 <b>Slowing</b> <b>down</b> {{when you}} should 2 ̆ 7 has been {{described}} as marking the transition from 2 ̆ 7 automatic 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 effortful 2 ̆ 7 functioning in professional practice. The ability to 2 ̆ 7 <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 is hypothesized as an important factor in expert judgment. This study explored the nature of the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon intraoperatively and its link to surgical judgment. METHODS: Twenty-eight surgeons across different surgical specialties were interviewed from four hospitals affiliated with a large urban university. In grounded theory tradition, data were collected and analyzed in an iterative design, using a constant comparative approach. Emergent themes were identified and a conceptual framework was developed. RESULTS: Surgeons recognized the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon acknowledging its link to judgment and described two main initiators. Proactively planned 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 moments were anticipated preoperatively from operation-specific (tying superior thyroid vessels) or patient-specific (imaging abnormality) factors. Surgeons also described situationally responsive 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 moments to unexpected events (encountering an adherent tumor). Surgeons described several influencing factors on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> phenomenon (fatigue, confidence). CONCLUSIONS: This framework for 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 assists in making tangible the previously elusive construct of surgical judgment, providing a vocabulary for considering the events surrounding these critical moments in surgery, essential for teaching, self-reflection, and patient safety...|$|R

40|$|Shafieloo ea al. firstly {{proposed}} {{the possibility that}} the current cosmic acceleration (CA) is <b>slowing</b> <b>down.</b> However, this is rather counterintuitive because a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA cannot be accommodated in most mainstream cosmological models. In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories of dark energy equation of state w(z) and deceleration parameter q(z), we present a comprehensive investigation on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA from both the theoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the impact of different w(z) by using six parametrization models, and then discuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we investigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive to the specific form of w(z); in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS 3 SNe Ia datasets favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA at 1 σ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an eternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible. (3) Compared with CMB distance prior data, full CMB data more favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA. (4) Due to the low significance, the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA is still a theoretical possibility that cannot be confirmed by the current observations.
