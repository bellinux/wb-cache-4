40|$|The use of <b>soft</b> <b>research</b> {{approaches}} {{is gaining}} popularity in construction research for their appeal of highlighting issues which are normally not visible through using the traditional hard research methods. The hard research approaches tend to develop generic findings. However {{these findings are}} only applicable under a given set of constraints. Once the constraints changes, these findings are less meaningful. The construction industry is unique and the construction problems are unique.

40|$|High Reliability Organizations (HROs) are {{organizations}} with processes that have extremely low failure rates, because {{the costs of}} failures are extremely high. According to Weick, Sutcliffe, and Obstfeld (2008) the key aspects of HROs are: preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify, and sensitivity to operations, among others. While we understand What the aspects of HROs are, we lack the understanding of How to implement HROs and Why they work. Using a <b>soft</b> <b>research</b> methods approach with Mindfulness techniques, this study demonstrates implementation of HRO in healthcare. In doing so, this research finds that Mindfulness techniques used with Soft Systems Methods provide an effective framework to create HROs. In doing so, this study also discovers a sixth aspect of HROs...|$|E

40|$|In the USA, the UK and Australia, a {{combination}} of credential inflation and attendant instrumentalism has resulted in theory being a disparaged part of educational research, and thus also doctoral research in education. This disparagement comes {{in part from the}} conflation of theory with abstract purposelessness, and its connection with <b>soft</b> <b>research</b> as opposed to applied research into, and for, educational policy and practice. In many ways this dichotomy is paradigmatically located, in that it is only some forms of theory that are seen as under attack. In the UK in the mid- 1990 s, Ball lamented a-theoretical moves within sociology of education to issues of management, measurement, evaluation, and so forth, and the resultant creation of new fields such as 'school improvement', 'leadership', and so forth. In the early 2000 s, qualitative researchers in the USA have felt the veracity of their work is undercut, and inadequately funded due to an emphasis on 'evidence-based' research, coded as large-scale 'scientific research in education', as 'gold standard' quantitative research. However, Atkinson and Delamont argue {{that this is a very}} insular viewpoint that conflates shifts in the USA with trends in other countries. They argue that in the UK rigorous qualitative research is not only respected, but also centrally located within research council funding schemes. Nonetheless, Sikes writes that in the UK the marketisation of education and research has meant that 'research which apparently provides value-free, objective, and quantifiable evidence that can directly inform practice is favoured and funded'. Clearly the world of theory and research is a fraught one...|$|E

40|$|This book captures {{current trends}} and {{developments}} {{in the field of}} systems thinking and <b>soft</b> operations <b>research</b> which can be applied to solve today's problems of dynamic complexity and interdependency. Such ‘wicked problems’ and messes are seemingly intractable problems characterized as value-laden, ambiguous, and unstable, that resist being tamed by classical problem solving. Actions and interventions associated with this complex problem space can have highly unpredictable and unintended consequences. Examples of such complex problems include health care reform, global climate change, transnational serious and organized crime, terrorism, homeland security, human security, disaster management, and humanitarian aid. Moving towards the development of solutions to these complex problem spaces depends on the lens we use to examine them and how we frame the problem. It will be shown that systems thinking and <b>soft</b> operations <b>research</b> has had great success in contributing to the management of complexity. ...|$|R

Further progress in <b>soft</b> robotics <b>research</b> has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities—that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach.

In all, {{the first step}} interprets the real world into a description used in following stages. In system dynamics, description leads to equations of a model, simulation to understand dynamic behavior, evaluation of alternative policies, education and choice of a better policy, and implementation. Case studies, systems thinking, and soft OR usually lack the discipline of explicit model creation and simulation and so rely on subjective use of unreliable intuition for evaluating the complex structures that emerge from the initial description of the real system. Nevertheless, systems thinking and soft OR, with emphasis on eliciting information from real-world participants, should contribute useful insights to system dynamics. Conversely, the model creation and simulation stages of system dynamics should contribute rigor and clarity to systems thinking and soft OR...|$|R
