As a result of a December 1, 2013, train derailment in the Bronx on the Metro-North Railroad, railroads with similar cab signal systems to Metro-North, such as the LIRR, were ordered to modify the systems to enforce certain speed limit changes, which has resulted in lower average speeds and actual speed limits across the LIRR.|$|E

50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>display</b> {{signs are}} {{sometimes}} {{used in conjunction}} with physical traffic calming solutions. They are also used on streets that cities do not want to put physical measures on either because of snow concerns or traffic volume.

50|$|FAMOS is a {{graphical}} {{data analysis}} program for evaluating and visually displaying measurement results. The program, {{whose name is}} an acronym for Fast Analysis And Monitoring Of Signals, was introduced in 1987 by the German company imc Meßsysteme GmbH (integrated measurement & control) in Berlin for Windows 3.11. According to its manufacturer, FAMOS offers high <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> and processing of data sets of any size.|$|E
5000|$|Signs are {{available}} {{in a range of}} costs with a variety of different features. Manufacturers of radar speed signs abound, ranging in style and features from a basic inexpensive sign to more sophisticated signs with myriad features to help analyze data and improve results. Pole mounted signs that combine <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> with variable message capability are often used in school zones, eliminating the trailer's [...] "footprint".|$|E
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped film advance lever. The stop down lever was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to these aspects there is Yellow-over-Green, which carries the meaning 'Reduce to Medium speed' (35 km/h) and is used when the next signal displays one of the Medium speed indications. If the top light (normal <b>speed)</b> only <b>displays</b> red (such as departing from a crossing loop), it is only fitted with a red aspect. If the lower light (medium <b>speed)</b> only <b>displays</b> red, it is often replaced with a red reflector {{in place of a}} red light.|$|R
5000|$|TVM-300 was {{developed}} in the 1970s as part of the TGV project. At speeds of above 220 kilometres per hour, TGV trains run only on dedicated tracks designated as [...] (LGV). At high-speeds it is not possible for a driver to accurately see colour-light based railway signals along the track-side. Signalling information is instead transmitted to the train and displayed as part of the train controls. The driver is shown the safe operating <b>speed,</b> <b>displayed</b> in kilometres per hour.|$|R

5000|$|The OM-4 was {{the first}} camera with a {{built-in}} multi-spot exposure meter (2% of view; 3.3˚ with 50 mm lens) which could take up to eight spot measurements and average them. Another unique feature was the selectable option to assess the darkest or brightest part of the scene, the camera adjusting the exposure based on that measure. The light meter used a dual-concentric segmented silicon photodiode to provide spot or center-weighted readings. It used a graduated, linear LCD shutter <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder to precisely indicate its readings versus the actual camera settings.|$|E
5000|$|Long Island Rail Road Automatic Speed Control: The LIRR was a PRR {{subsidiary}} {{and it is}} {{no surprise}} that they would adopt a similar system. The LIRR used standard PRR cab signals until bought by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968, when it was modified slightly into ASC systems used to this day. ASC employs two additional codes, 270 and 420 ppm and replaces the in-cab signal display with an in-cab <b>speed</b> <b>display.</b> The additional codes are used to display speeds of 50/60 and 60/70 mph, which are used to slow trains for curves, higher speed turnouts and short signal blocks.|$|E

50|$|While it is {{possible}} to use audio processing software to correct speed it is much easier and more straight forward to use a turntable running at the correct speed to capture the recording. For those working with acoustic recordings, commonly referred to as early 78s, it would be very useful if the LCD displayed the actual platter speed in rpm to two decimal places in addition to the pitch variation in percentage since various acoustic gramophone records were made to rotate at speeds ranging from 60 to over 90 rpm, with most around 78 rpm, depending on the label or manufacturer. With the adoption of the Western Electric recording system in 1925 the speed was standardized to be 78.26 rpm. With a pitch range of +/-20%, or about 65 to 94 rpm, the Numark Pro TT1+ and Pro TT2 turntables cover the speed range for most acoustic records. The question does arise as to whether 78 rpm is 78, 78.26, or 78-1/3 rpm on the Numark turntables. Hence, having an accurate digital <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> would be beneficial.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sport watch" [...] {{functionality}} often includes {{activity tracker}} features (also known as [...] "fitness tracker") {{as seen in}} GPS watches made for training, diving, and outdoor sports. Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, <b>speed</b> <b>display,</b> GPS tracking unit, Route tracking, dive computer, heart rate monitor compatibility, Cadence sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in triathlons). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a smartphone {{to carry out their}} functions. They may be little more than timepieces unless they are paired, usually by Bluetooth with a mobile phone. Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same mobile operating system; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones. Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone. This allows the watch to display data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, calendar invites, and any data that may be made available by relevant phone apps. Some fitness tracker watches give users reports on the number of kilometers they walked, hours they slept, and so on.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results from}} a field {{experiment}} (conducted in 2012) are presented, in which 3 regional police units in the Flemish region of Belgium each tested a particular combination of a speed control (with mobile radar in an anonymous car) with communicative signage. The goal {{of this paper was}} to scientifically evaluate frequently used field set-ups. The following set-ups were tested in one week: (1) police unit 1 : speed control with and without a static feedback sign placed after the control; (2) police unit 2 : speed control with and without a digital feedback sign placed after the control; (3) police unit 3 : <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> followed by a second <b>speed</b> <b>display</b> further along the road section. During certain time frames, speed control took place in between both signs. All tested field set-ups generated significant reductions in the speed level. Studying the effect of the different variations for each set-up reveals that the effect of the speed control is generally larger in combination with the signage alongside the road. After the period during which the police activities took place, speed levels again reached their initial level. Based on the before–after analysis, only in police area 2 was a small ‘time halo-effect’ found. To generalize results from this pilot study, repetition of tested set-ups in the field is recommended as well as testing on a larger scale...|$|E

5000|$|As far as {{the wind}} is concerned, it should be {{recalled}} that as the speed scale factor is 1 in 5, a wind of 10 knots on the lake is equivalent to a 50 knot squall in reality.

The wind and ship <b>speeds</b> <b>displayed</b> on the control panel are therefore very important for trainees. However, the lake is situated in a forest in a region with little wind, so that uncontrollable wind effects are minimised.|$|R
