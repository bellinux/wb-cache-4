30|$|Since {{we did not}} test macroecological {{hypotheses}} in this paper, {{future studies}} should investigate macroecological correlates to the different species richness patterns which are documented in this study. However, such correlative studies will always suffer from the absence of historical data to test real cause-and-effect relationships: {{an example is the}} mid-elevation <b>species</b> <b>hump</b> due to a mid-domain effect (Colwell and Lees 2000) or the almost-complete anthropogenic alteration of Taiwan's lowland ecosystems (Shiu and Lee 2003; Lee et al. 2004; Koh et al. 2006 a). For the purposes of conservation, however, it is sufficient to highlight important areas which should be the target of more intensive field work and conservation management.|$|R
5000|$|It resembles morphologically {{most closely}} Sinocyclocheilus yishanensis {{known from the}} Liu River, another river in the Pearl River system. Both have [...] "normal" [...] body shape, in {{contrast}} to some other Sinocyclocheilus <b>species</b> showing <b>humps</b> or horns.|$|R
50|$|C. frontosa {{can grow}} to 33 cm in length. Even captive {{specimens}} potentially grow to this size. It has distinct markings with 5-7 black vertical bars adorning a white or blue body and head and trailing fins {{with a distinct}} blue hue. The species also develops a nuchal hump that is more pronounced in older specimens. C. frontosa is a sexually monomorphic <b>species,</b> although the <b>hump</b> is occasionally more pronounced in males. These fishes can live for over 25 years.|$|R
40|$|The word camel {{is derived}} from the Greek word &# 8220;kremal&# 8221;. Camel is an {{important}} component of the desert ecosystem from time immemorial and is recognized as the &# 8220;Ship of the desert&# 8221;. Humans depend on this animal not just for meat, milk and hide but also as one of the most important mode of transport in the desert which has increased to 10, 30, 000 million according to FAO census, which is almost 6 - 8 % of the total camel population of the world. The genus Camelus has two <b>species,</b> one <b>humped</b> camel found in Africa, Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and India and two-humped camel found in Central Asia reaching up to Mongolia and Western part of China. Camels have 70 chromosomes. Camels do not have sweat glands and can tolerate heat up to 49 oC to 50 oC during the day time and 30 oC during night time. [Vet. World 2009; 2 (2. 000) : 72 - 73...|$|R
25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some sockeye salmon develop {{pronounced}} humps {{just before they}} spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer <b>species</b> advantages. The <b>humps</b> make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|R
40|$|Alburnoides manyasensis, sp. n., is {{described}} from the Koca Stream (Lake Manyas drainage, Marmara Sea basin) in Anatolia. It is distinguished from all species of Alburnoides in Turkey and adjacent regions, Alburnoides tzanevi (Rezovska [Rezve], Istranca and Terkos streams {{in the western}} Black Sea drainage), Alburnoides cf. smyrnae (Banaz Stream, a drainage of Büyük Menderes River, Aegean Sea basin), Alburnoides fasciatus (streams and rivers in the eastern Black Sea drainage) and Alburnoides eichwaldii (Kura and Aras rivers [a drainage of Kura River], Caspian Sea basin) {{by a combination of}} the following characters (none unique to the <b>species)</b> : marked <b>hump</b> at nape, especially in specimens larger than 60 mm SL; partly developed ventral keel between pelvic fin and anal fin, scaleless 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 its length; body depth at dorsal-fin origin 29 − 32 % SL; caudal peduncle depth 11 − 12 % SL; 45 – 52 + 2 – 3 lateral-line scales; 9 – 12 scale rows between lateral line and dorsal-fin origin; 4 – 5 scale rows between lateral line and anal-fin origin, 10 &frac 12;– 12 &frac 12; branched anal-fin rays; 40 – 42 total vertebrae...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpecies {{abundance}} distributions (SAD) {{are central}} to the description of diversity and have {{played a major role in}} the development of theories of biodiversity and biogeography. However, most work on species abundance distributions has focused on one single spatial scale. Here we used data on arthropods to test predictions obtained with computer simulations on whether dispersal ability influences the rate of change of SADs as a function of sample size. To characterize the change of the shape of the SADs we use the moments of the distributions: the skewness and the raw moments. In agreement with computer simulations, low dispersal ability <b>species</b> generate a <b>hump</b> for intermediate abundance classes earlier than the distributions of high dispersal ability species. Importantly, when plotted as function of sample size, the raw moments of the SADs of arthropods have a power law pattern similar to that observed for the SAD of tropical tree species, thus we conjecture that this might be a general pattern in ecology. The existence of this pattern allows us to extrapolate the moments and thus reconstruct the SAD for larger sample sizes using a procedure borrowed from the field of image analysis based on scaled discrete Tchebichef moments and polynomials. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
