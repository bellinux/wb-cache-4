40|$|In {{order to}} make a long rail of high carbon steel for railroad, about 300 m long rails are {{prepared}} in shop of JNR by flash butt welding. After that enclosed are welding or telmit welding are used in the field but in some case only enclosed are welding is used to build up a long rail. The life of heat-treated rail is three to five times of as <b>rolled</b> <b>rail.</b> Today, commonly speaking, only as <b>rolled</b> <b>rails</b> are used to make a long rail. However, heat-treated long rails are desired at private railways. Therefore, fatigue characteristics of both as <b>rolled</b> and heat-treated <b>rails</b> are investigated and the latter showed better fatigue properties. Impact properties of as <b>rolled</b> <b>rails</b> are reported in the previous report and those of heat-treated rails are investigated now. Impact properties of heat-treated rails seem to be better than those of as rolled ones. These results will be reported in the next paper...|$|R

50|$|The {{three-roll}} {{variable pitch}} works by having all three rolls {{able to move}} and tilt. The top roll moves in the vertical plane and the <b>side</b> <b>rolls</b> move on the horizontal plane.When rolling, the top roll presses the metal plate between the two <b>side</b> <b>rolls.</b> The advantage of having the variable three roll {{is the ability to}} roll many thicknesses and diameters of cylinders.|$|R

50|$|Wrought iron {{was used}} for minor {{structural}} and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to <b>roll</b> <b>rails,</b> bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.|$|R

6000|$|Our firm is a Steel Corporation. We <b>roll</b> <b>rails.</b> As {{soon as we}} {{read your}} {{circular}} on the Stimulus of Competition we saw that there were big things in it. At once we sent one of our chief managers to the rolling, mill. He carried a paper bag in his hand. [...] "Now boys," [...] he said, [...] "every man who <b>rolls</b> a <b>rail</b> gets a gum-drop." [...] The effect was magical. The good fellows felt a new stimulus. They now <b>roll</b> out <b>rails</b> like dough. Work is a joy to them. Every Saturday night {{the man who has}} rolled most gets a blue ribbon; the man who has rolled the next most, a green ribbon; the next most a yellow ribbon, and so on through the spectroscope. The man who rolls least gets only a red ribbon. It is a real pleasure to see the brave fellows clamouring for their ribbons. Our output, after defraying the entire cost of the ribbons and the gum-drops, has increased forty per cent. We intend to carry the scheme further by allowing all the men who get a hundred blue ribbons first, to exchange them for the Grand Efficiency Prize of the firm,--a pink ribbon. This the winner will be entitled to wear whenever and wherever he sees fit to wear it.|$|R

50|$|Flanged T rail (also called T-section) is {{the name}} for flat {{bottomed}} rail used in North-America.Iron-strapped wooden rails were used on all American railways until 1831. Col. Robert L. Stevens, the President of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, conceived the idea that an all-iron rail would be better suited for building a railroad. There were no steel mills in America capable of rolling long lengths, so he sailed to England which {{was the only place}} where his flanged T rail (also called T-section) could be rolled. Railways in England had been using <b>rolled</b> <b>rail</b> of other cross-sections which the ironmasters had produced.|$|R
50|$|All {{rolls in}} the game are done by using 12-sided dice, and adding or {{subtracting}} a modifier (adding being far more common). Human-level abilities and skills add 1 to 4 to a die roll result, while superhuman abilities can add anything from 5 up, with modifiers adding more than 12 through a single ability being somewhat rare, but not unheard of for superheroes. To use an ability against a foe or other opposing force, you have to simply meet or beat the other <b>side's</b> total result. <b>Rolls</b> are usually opposed (both <b>sides</b> <b>roll).</b>|$|R

In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted I beam), which had a flat bottom and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted U section with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|R

40|$|A {{square steel}} pipe is {{reshaped}} from a welded round pipe by roll forming. The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a roll-forming machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and bottom rolls is usually set larger than that of the <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors. When the diameter of the top roll is larger than that of the <b>side</b> <b>roll,</b> the width of a corner part of the formed pipe is larger than the height. A square pipe was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases. Therefore, elliptical preforming is effective in forming square pipe with a sharp corner. However, excessive preforming causes a hollow at the flat surface of a square product.
