5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure, resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil <b>supply</b> <b>pipe,</b> led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E
500|$|Overtones of the Civil War {{and racial}} {{conflict}} were evident. Brooks' men numbered 600by this time, and were all freedmen who supported Republicans as their emancipators. Baxter's forces, all white Democrats, {{continued to grow}} steadily during the conflict until they reached nearly 2,000. Several bloody skirmishes occurred. Known as the Battle of Palarm, a small naval battle erupted on the Arkansas River near Natural Steps, where Brooks' men attacked a flatboat known as the [...] "Hallie", thought to be bringing supplies. The shooting lasted around ten to fifteen minutes before the pilot ran up a white flag signaling a surrender. One stray bullet pierced the vessel's <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> between the boiler and engine, cutting off its power, and the boat drifted downriver, out of gun range, and lodged on the Southern (Western) shore. Sources vary as to the actual casualties of the incident. The boat's captain, a pilot, and one rifleman were killed; the other pilot and three or four riflemen were wounded. One source stated that the Brooks regiment suffered one man killed and three wounded; another report was that five men were killed and [...] "quite a number" [...] wounded.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for an operating ram to require occasional restarts. The cycling may stop due to poor adjustment of the waste valve, or insufficient water flow at the source. Air can enter if the supply water level is not at least a few inches above the input end of the <b>supply</b> <b>pipe.</b> Other problems are blockage of the valves with debris, or improper installation, such as using a <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> of non uniform diameter or material, having sharp bends or a rough interior, or one that is too long or short for the drop, or is made of an insufficiently rigid material. A PVC <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> will work in some installations but is not as optimal as steel.|$|E

50|$|By the 1970s, {{replacement}} of the water <b>supply</b> <b>pipe</b> that was running through the Waiwhetu Tunnel had become necessary.
