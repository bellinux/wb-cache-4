5|$|A {{mountain}} resort municipality designation is {{granted by the}} Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development through the Local Government Act if there exists alpine <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> operations, year-round recreational facilities, and commercial overnight accommodations. There are two {{mountain resort}} municipalities in British Columbia: Sun Peaks and Jumbo Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Blunt's main {{residence}} is in Ibiza. He also owns a chalet in the Swiss town of Verbier, which he purchased in February 2007, {{and has a}} <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> named after him there. In 2012, Blunt, Carl Fogarty and Lawrence Dallaglio opened a restaurant {{at the top of}} the chairlift called La Vache.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the hill}} and judge's tower started on 1 July 1980 and was {{completed}} on 1 December 1982. Construction of the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> started on 1 October 1982 and was completed on 30 October 1983. The jumps were inaugurated in 1983. After the Olympics, Sarajevo experienced a boom in recreational skiing among locals, including ski jumping.|$|E
50|$|The vintage <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> were {{installed}} in 1952 by Harwood Developments. They were operated as Mt Baldy <b>Ski</b> <b>Lifts</b> Inc, and managed by Herbert Leffler from 1953 {{until his retirement}} in 1969. The resort was sold to an investment group in 1969.|$|R
50|$|CTEC, {{which stands}} for Cable Transportation Engineering Company, was the {{successor}} to Thiokol, a company which built 41 <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> between 1971 and 1977. By 1977, Thiokol had decided to stop producing <b>ski</b> <b>lifts</b> and sold their designs to two employees, Jan Leonard and Mark Ballantyne.|$|R
50|$|The Markstein ski {{station has}} eight <b>ski</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Raptor {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders in <b>Ski</b> <b>lift</b> like trains. Riders are secured by an over the shoulder restraint with a locking belt. The trains were manufactured in Switzerland at Bolliger & Mabillard's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Kanthaugen has {{traditionally}} {{served as a}} recreational area for Lillehammer, and has in particular been used for alpine skiing. In 1946, Norway's then-largest <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> was installed between Stampesletta and Kanthaugen. It remained in use until the late 1970s. At {{the time of the}} closing, a local businessman proposed that it be renovated and that a tobogganing slide be built from Kanthaugen to Stampesletta. The plans were met by local opposition and were not carried through.|$|E
5|$|Kanthaugen {{has hosted}} FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup events twice, on 26 to 28 March 1993 and on 3 to 5 March 1995. It also hosted the Norwegian Freestyle Skiing Championships in 1993 and 1996. Lillehammer is {{scheduled}} to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Kanthaugen to host freestyle skiing and half-pipe snowboarding. The venue is designated a Norway's national freestyle skiing venue and is the main training ground for the national team. The area around the venue is a popular recreational area for Lillehammer. Since 1995, Lillehammer Olympiapark has rented out toboggans {{for use in the}} hill, including use of the <b>ski</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E
5|$|Papoose Peak Jumps was a {{ski jumping}} hill located at Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the US state of California. The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the ski jumping event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished {{to make room for}} a <b>ski</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
5|$|The hill {{required}} {{a lot of}} volunteer work to maintain and run during the season and particularly for the tournament. It also lacked a <b>ski</b> <b>lift.</b> Combined, this made {{it increasingly difficult to}} recruit new ski jumpers during the 1960s, particularly after a lift was installed on Mount Revelstoke in 1961. Skiing activities moved to Mount Mackenzie during the 1960s and in 1973, the ski club also relocated to there. The Tournament of Champions during 1971 and 1972 incurred a heavy loss. The last major tournaments in Nels Nelson Hill were the Western Canadian Ski Jumping Tournament, the Canadian Junior and Senior Ski Jumping Championship and the International Cross Country Championship, held in February and March 1974. The last tournament was a junior event held in 1975. The venue has since fallen into disrepair.|$|E

In the summer hiking and {{mountain}} biking are popular. <b>Ski</b> <b>lifts</b> operate year-round at Mount Buller allowing bikers to easily {{get to the}} top of downhill mountain biking runs.|$|R
5|$|Tourist {{facilities}} in Sisimiut include several youth hostels and hotels, such as Hotel Sisimiut with Restaurant Nasaasaaq, and Seaman's Home, and a conference center. The other restaurant of note is the Misigisaq Restaurant, {{located at the}} harbor. It is the only Chinese restaurant {{in the country and}} it uses Greenlandic ingredients cooked in the Chinese style. The town has a heated open-air swimming pool, which is supported on stilts so that the heat does not melt the permafrost. Several camping sites are located in Sisimiut valley and near the Kangerluarsunnguaq bay. During winter, a <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> operates {{at the foot of the}} Alanngorsuaq mountain, at the base of the northern slopes of Nasaasaaq.|$|E

25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the main cable during construction. In several ways similar to a <b>ski</b> <b>lift,</b> additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled from one end of the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E
25|$|A {{chair lift}} {{is a type}} of aerial lift, which {{consists}} of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas, but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran, an engineer from the Union Pacific Railroad, invented and built the first chair lift in the world. Known as the Proctor Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Lift,</b> it was located in Sun Valley, Idaho.|$|E
25|$|A stone cottage {{was built}} at Mount Hotham in 1925 to cater {{for a growing}} {{interest}} in sport of skiing and a Club was built in 1944 with the first ski tow installed in 1951. A ski hut was erected at Mount Baw Baw, just 120km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski rope tow added in 1955. The first <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, {{and in the same}} year a rope tow was installed at Falls Creek. In 1957, Australia's first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek, and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.|$|E

25|$|As {{this class}} {{includes}} skiers with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. Skiers in this classification who have paralysis {{as a result of}} hemiplegia, stroke or polio tend to initially favour a strong side of their body when they learn to ski, which sometimes results in overskiing. Ski-bras and bungie cords are used in training to correct this. If this is not corrected, skiers are likely to fall over when their skis cross in front of them. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> using the same technique as able-bodied skiers.|$|E
25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski on the snow. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, 20 November {{the party}} {{set off on}} a two-day navigational {{exercise}} to cross the Cairngorm Plateau from Cairn Gorm south to Ben Macdui. Because they were very late in starting (it was almost 11:00 when they left Lagganlia) they used the Cairngorm <b>ski</b> <b>lift</b> {{to get close to}} the plateau and then, as planned, they separated into two groups â the more experienced group led by Beattie set off and was followed by the group led by Davidson and Sunderland. After crossing the plateau both groups were to descend to the Corrour Bothy at a much lower level in the Lairig Ghru where they would spend the night â sunset was just before 16:00. The less-experienced group of 15-year-olds would then return along the Lairig Ghru while the other group would return by traversing Cairn Toul and Braeriach {{on the far side of}} the valley. In case of emergency each group was to go to the Curran shelter high on the plateau. This plan had been approved in advance by the head of Lagganlia, John Paisley, who could forbid unsuitable expeditions.|$|E
