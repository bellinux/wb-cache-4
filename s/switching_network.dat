After {{earning his}} PhD {{in electrical engineering}} from MIT in 1963, Roberts continued to work at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory where in 1965 he connected Lincoln Lab's TX-2 computer to the SDC Q-32 computer in Santa Monica. In 1966, he became a program manager in the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), where he led {{the development of the}} ARPANET, the first wide area packet <b>switching</b> <b>network.</b> Roberts applied Donald Davies' concepts of packet switching for the ARPANET, and also sought input from Paul Baran and Leonard Kleinrock. After Robert Taylor left ARPA in 1969, Roberts became director of the IPTO. In 1973, he left ARPA to commercialize the nascent technology in the form of Telenet, the first data network utility, and served as its CEO from 1973 to 1980. In 2012, Roberts was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{multi-mode}} {{message passing}} <b>switch</b> <b>networks</b> for multi-standard QC-LDPC decoder are presented. An enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> {{with only one}} barrel shifter permutation structure and a shifter-based two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> are proposed to support 19 and 3 different submatrices defined in IEEE 802. 16 e and IEEE 802. 11 n. These proposed <b>switch</b> <b>networks</b> can route the decoding message in parallel by different sizes without signal congestion. The enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> can <b>switch</b> the messages at different expansion factors with the lowest hardware complexity. Under the condition of a smaller expansion factor, the decoder throughput can be enhanced from the two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> by increasing the parallelism. In the 130 nm CMOS synthesis result, the proposed enhanced self-routing and the two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> gate counts are 21. 9 k and 37. 4 k at 384 MHz operation frequency.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} cost-effective designs of {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for current and future generation communication systems. Based on different target applications: we categorize WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> into two connection models: the wavelength-based model and the fiberlink-based model. Most of existing WDM optical switching networksbelongtothefirst category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. The newly designed sparse WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> have minimum hardware cost {{in terms of both}} the number of crosspoints and the number of wavelength converters. The single stage and multistage implementations of the sparse WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> are considered. An optimal routing algorithm for the proposed sparse WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> is also presented.

As a result, many space division switching systems used electromechanical switching networks with SPC.

The two types of space division electronic switching systems are using electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> and the other using electronic <b>switching</b> <b>network.</b> The second type is fully electronic.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} new simulation and analytic models for the performance analysis of wide area communication networks. The models are used to analyse adaptive routing and flow control in fully connected circuit switched and sparsely connected packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines. Previous analytic work in circuit switched work is extended to include both asymmetrical networks and adaptive routing policies. In the analysis of packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> analytic models of adaptive routing and flow control are integrated to produce a powerful, integrated environment for performance analysis The work concludes that routing algorithms based on linear learning automata have significant potential in both fully connected circuit <b>switched</b> <b>networks</b> and sparsely connected packet <b>switched</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
