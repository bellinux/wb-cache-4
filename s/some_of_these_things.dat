25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E
500|$|Engineer Rob Fraboni {{was brought}} to Shangri-La {{to clean up the}} {{recordings}} still in the possession of Hudson, the original engineer. Fraboni had worked on Dylan's Planet Waves album, with backing by The Band, and the live Dylan–Band album Before the Flood, both released in 1974. Fraboni has described Robertson as the dominant voice in selecting the final tracks for The Basement Tapes and reported that Dylan was not in the studio very often. The stereo recordings made by Hudson were remixed to mono, while Robertson and other members of The Band overdubbed new keyboard, guitar, and drum parts onto some of the 1967 Woodstock recordings. According to Fraboni, four new songs by The Band were also recorded in preparation for the album's official release, one of which, a cover of Chuck Berry's [...] "Going Back to Memphis", did not end up being included. There is disagreement about the recording date of the other three songs: [...] "Bessie Smith", [...] "Ain't No More Cane" [...] and [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry". While Fraboni has recalled that The Band taped them in 1975, the liner notes for the reissued versions of The Band's own albums state that these songs were recorded between 1967 and 1970. Ultimately, eight of the twenty-four songs on The Basement Tapes did not feature Dylan, several of the studio outtakes postdating the sessions at Big Pink. In justifying their inclusion, Robertson explained that he, Hudson and Dylan did not have access to all the basement recordings: [...] "We had access to some of the songs. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> came under the heading of 'homemade' which meant a Basement Tape to us." [...] Robertson has suggested that the Basement Tapes are, for him, [...] "a process, a homemade feel" [...] and so could include recordings {{from a wide variety of}} sources.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E

In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled the prohibition of same-sex marriage was unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges and state legislation was subsequently introduced in 2015 and 2016 to repeal the prohibition of same-sex marriage (SB 10, HB 1395, SB 782).|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{originally}} {{announced that}} he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on [...] "filmic storytelling". Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: [...] "I think it's almost counterproductive to say <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'" [...] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a [...] professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.|$|E

2500|$|The bonfires {{were also}} used in divination rituals. In 18th century Ochtertyre, a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid round the fire, perhaps on a layer of ashes. Everyone then ran round it with a torch, [...] "exulting". In the morning, the stones were {{examined}} and if any was mislaid {{it was said that}} the person it represented would not live out the year. A similar custom was observed in north Wales and in Brittany. James Frazer says that this may come from [...] "an older custom of actually burning them" [...] (i.e. human sacrifice) or may have always been symbolic. Divination has likely {{been a part of the}} festival since ancient times, and it has survived in some rural areas. At household festivities throughout the Gaelic regions and Wales, there were many rituals intended to divine the future of those gathered, especially with regard to death and marriage. Apples and hazelnuts were often used in these divination rituals or games. In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom. One of the most common games was apple bobbing. Another involved hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod was spun round and everyone took turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth. Apples were peeled in one long strip, the peel tossed over the shoulder, and its shape was said to form the first letter of the future spouse's name. Two hazelnuts were roasted near a fire; one named for the person roasting them and the other for the person they desired. If the nuts jumped away from the heat, it was a bad sign, but if the nuts roasted quietly it foretold a good match. [...] Items were hidden in food—usually a cake, barmbrack, cranachan, champ or sowans—and portions of it served out at random. A person's future was foretold by the item they happened to find; for example a ring meant marriage and a coin meant wealth. A salty oatmeal bannock was baked; the person ate it in three bites and then went to bed in silence without anything to drink. This was said to result in a dream in which their future spouse offers them a drink to quench their thirst. Egg whites were dropped in water, and the shapes foretold the number of future children. Children would also chase crows and divine <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> from the number of birds or the direction they flew.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{most recent}} {{confrontation}} with race-based affirmative action, Fisher v. University of Texas, {{did not live}} up to people’s expectations—or their fears. The Court did not explicitly change the current approach in any substantial way. It did, however, signal that it wants race-based affirmative action to be subject to real strict scrutiny, not the watered-down version featured in Grutter v. Bollinger. That is a significant signal, because under real strict scrutiny, almost all race-based affirmative action programs are likely unconstitutional. This is especially true given the conceptual framework the Court has created for such programs—the way the Court has set up the constitutional analysis. On the other hand, the Court’s conceptual framework is wildly, almost absurdly, wrong. This Article will discuss the way the Court has set up the constitutional analysis of affirmative action and why it is wrong. It will do so {{in the form of a}} list—a list of the propositions we must accept if we are to take the Court’s affirmative action jurisprudence at face value. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are <b>things</b> that the Court has said explicitly, and others are inferences I feel it is fair to draw. Not all of them command majority support, and when they do not, I note that. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> them, I hope, bear their absurdity on their face; for others, I offer <b>some</b> explanation <b>of</b> why I think they do not make sense. In all, I hope this list supports the assessment I give my first-year constitutional law students: of all the areas of the Court’s jurisprudence we cover in our survey of constitutional law, the handling of race-based affirmative action is the least defensible...|$|R
