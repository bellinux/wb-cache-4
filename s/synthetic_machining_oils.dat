In this paper, the {{low alloy}} bainite {{ductile cast iron}} has been {{obtained}} by a new heat treatment technique of the step austempering in room-temperature <b>machine</b> <b>oil.</b> The effects of element boron, manganese and copper on structure and mechanical properties of the bainite ductile cast Iron in above-mentioned process are investigated. The phenomenon, hardness lag of the alloyed bainite ductile cast Iron, has been discussed.

It is found that boron and manganese can increase the hardness and reduce the impact strength while copper can increase the impact strength.

Approaches taken by several research groups to construct wholly <b>synthetic</b> molecular <b>machines</b> and devices are compared.

We will conclude with prospects for future developments in this exciting field of nanotechnology. ...|$|R

In many cases, removal of the {{hydrocarbon}} <b>machining</b> <b>oils</b> is necessary before the metals can undergo further processing such as electroplating. In other situations, the stamping occurs as the last {{step in the process}} and the formed metal parts must be cleaned before packaging and shipping. Because the CFC solvents have been implicated in stratospheric ozone depletion, AT&T has developed a policy that calls for a 50 % reduction in emissions by 1991 with eventual discontinuation of emissions in manufacturing processes by 1994. To comply with the corporate goals, alternative methods of metal cleaning must be developed. These methods may involve cleaning techniques that do not depend upon CFCs or processes that do not result in contaminated parts. Previous to this work, CFC- 113 was used in the production of circuit board backplane pins in Kansas City. The incoming rolls of CA 725 metal (Cu/ Ni/Sn) alloy were lubricated with <b>machining</b> <b>oils,</b> stamped and immersed in an ultrasonically agitated CFC- 1 13 bath to remove residual oil in a continuous reel-to-reel operation. The reels of stamped metal were then inspected for physical imperfections, stored for a variable period and sent to the plating shop as needed.

The parts were rinsed, immersed in an acidic solution for preplate activation, plated with the appropriate metals and finally coated with insertion oil. Cleanliness is very im...|$|R
