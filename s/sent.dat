5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comité Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims. Officials <b>sent</b> medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead {{to determine the extent of}} damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP <b>sent</b> US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme <b>sent</b> 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter <b>sent</b> a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later <b>sent</b> US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community <b>sent</b> US$227,000 worth of food and medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries <b>sent</b> additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid.

On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water containers, and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was <b>sent</b> for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations <b>sent</b> $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were <b>sent</b> to communities in need.

50|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the present airport in Ülemiste area, Lasnamäe Airfield was the primary airport of Tallinn, serving as a base for Aeronaut airline. After Aeronaut went bankrupt in 1928, air service was continued by Deruluft, which used Nehatu instead, 12 km from the centre of Tallinn. The first seaplane harbour on the shores of Lake Ülemiste was built 1928 to 1929 in order to serve Finnish seaplanes. The use of this harbour ended in World War II. On 26 March 1929 Riigikogu passed an expropriation act in order to establish a public airport. 10 ha of land was expropriated from Dvigatel joint-stock company and another 22 ha was expropriated from descendants of Vagner. 10 million <b>sents</b> were paid to land-owners as indemnity.

By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to stagnant waters, although no such outbreaks occurred.

A total of 174 men were <b>sent</b> to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches, which only about ten percent of the 2/18th men survived. Despite being separated, though, wherever possible the 2/18th men sought to stay together in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity. The battalion's first commanding officer, Varley, was one of those <b>sent</b> to Burma where, as senior Allied officer, he worked to secure the welfare of over 9,000 men working on the railway, including many from the 2/18th. He was later <b>sent</b> to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed. In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa. On 12 September, while en route, the transport ship—Rakuyo Maru—that he and around 1,250 other prisoners were on, was torpedoed by a US submarine, USS Sealion. Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation, attempting to lead them to safety. They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine-gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area.|$|E
