50|$|Auxiliary cutter with Bermudian rig. Long keel yacht with counter {{stern and}} <b>spoon</b> <b>bow.</b> 11 tons, 37.4 ft LOA. Built by A. Everson & Sons of Woodbridge, Suffolk in 1937.|$|E
50|$|J. & E. Riggins sparred {{length is}} 120 ft, 89 ft on deck, 23 ft at the beam and draws 7 ft with the {{centerboard}} up. She is a bald-headed schooner with low sides and a <b>spoon</b> <b>bow,</b> using a yawl boat for auxiliary power {{as one might}} a small tug boat to maneuver the vessel {{on and off the}} dock and when she is becalmed.|$|E
5000|$|The Gypsy (previously {{known as}} the Witch and the Wren) is a {{historic}} catboat whose home is in Wareham, Massachusetts. She was designed and built in 1900 by Bowdoin B. Crowninshield, as one of four identical sailing vessels, and was designated Crowninshield #149. Her design {{was influenced by the}} [...] "Seawanhaka Rule", instituted at the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club to govern important characteristics of racing boats. She has a <b>spoon</b> <b>bow,</b> low freeboard, and long overhangs rising out of the water fore and aft. Her hull is made of white cedar on an oaken frame, although the top levels have been replaced with cypress.|$|E
50|$|The {{schooner}} is 81 ft {{in overall}} length, extending 64 ft on deck and 48 ft along the waterline. At 36 gross tons, her maximum beam is 16 ft and she draws 10 ft of water. The design is a semi-fisherman type with a <b>spooned</b> <b>bow,</b> that was {{popular in the}} early 20th century. The full keel is made of solid oak and the hull is yellow pine over an oak frame. The floor timbers are oak, the stern is laminated mahogany, and the decks are teak. She has two spruce masts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} four {{designs for}} icebreaking tankers {{that have been}} developed by Samsung Heavy Industries and tested at NRC?s Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT). Three of the designs developed were twin-screw ships (with twin rudders). The first two bow shapes were similar to existing Canadian icebreakers. The third ship had a <b>spoon</b> shaped <b>bow</b> designed for heavy ice conditions. The fourth ship was designed for light to moderate ice conditions. The propulsion system for this ship was a single screw, single rudder stern with an innovative bulbous bow. This unique bow design showed considerable improvement in icebreaking performance compared to a conventional open-water bulbous bow but with almost no penalty to open water resistance. The paper presents predictions of speed and power for each icebreaking tanker design, in level ice, pack ice and open water. The important features of each hull form and propulsion system combination are discussed and the most appropriate voyage profile for each design is presented.

5000|$|A {{whaleback}} was a type {{of cargo}} steamship of unusual design, with a hull that continuously curved above the waterline from vertical to horizontal. When fully loaded, only the rounded portion of the hull (the [...] "whaleback" [...] proper) could be seen above the waterline. With sides curved in towards the ends, it had a <b>spoon</b> <b>bow</b> and a very convex upper deck. It was formerly used on the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States, notably for carrying grain or ore. The term developed in common usage {{in response to the}} ship's appearance when fully loaded. A total of 44 such vessels were constructed from 1887 to 1898. All but two were built initially as lake freighters for service on the Great Lakes. Six were built at Duluth, Minnesota; 33 were built at West Superior, Wisconsin; 2 at Brooklyn, New York; one at Everett, Washington; and one at Sunderland, England. A number of the Great Lakes vessels left the lakes for service on salt water seas.|$|E
