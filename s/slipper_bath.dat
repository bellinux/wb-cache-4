6000|$|Some {{time after}} his recovery, Captain Ellice {{purchased}} a brig, and fitted her {{out as a}} whaler, determined to try his fortune in the northern seas. Fred pleaded hard to be taken out, but his father {{felt that he had}} more need to go to school than to sea; so he refused, and Fred, after sighing very deeply once or twice, gave in with a good grace. Buzzby, too, who stuck to his old commander like a leech, was equally anxious to go, but Buzzby, in a sudden and unaccountable fit of tenderness, had, just two months before, married a wife, who might be appropriately described as [...] "fat, fair, and forty," [...] and Buzzby's wife absolutely forbade him to go. Alas! Buzzby was no longer his own master. At the age of forty-five he became--as he himself expressed it--an abject slave, and he would as soon have tried to steer in a <b>slipper</b> <b>bath,</b> right in the teeth of an equinoctial hurricane, as have opposed the will of his wife. He used to sigh gruffly when spoken to on this subject, and compare himself to a Dutch galliot that made more lee-way than head-way, even with a wind on the quarter. [...] "Once," [...] he would remark, [...] "I was clipper-built and could sail right in the wind's eye, but ever since I tuck this craft in tow I've gone to leeward like a tub. In fact, I find there's only one way of going ahead with my Poll, and that is right before the wind! I used to yaw about a good deal at first, but she tuck that out o' me in a day or two. If I put the helm only so much as one stroke to starboard, she guv' a tug at the tow-rope that brought the wind dead aft again; so I've gi'n it up, and lashed the tiller right amidships." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon the sleigh {{appeared}} in sight, {{coming up the}} river at full speed, and a loud [...] "hurrah!" [...] from {{the men at the}} gate, told the visitor that he was a welcome guest. It was a dog-sleigh--a sort of conveyance much used by the fur-traders in winter travelling. In form, it was as like as possible to a tin <b>slipper</b> <b>bath.</b> It might also be compared to a shoe. If the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a man, sitting with his legs out before him, that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole. There is sometimes an ornamental curve in front. It is made of two thin hardwood planks curled up in front, with a light frame-work of wood, covered over with deer or buffalo skin, and painted in a very gay manner. Four dogs are usually harnessed to it, and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days, over every sort of country, where there is no road whatever. Dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter. The traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs, that nothing but his head is visible. He is attended by a driver on snow-shoes, who is armed with a large whip. No reins are used. If the snow is hard, as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river, the driver walks behind and holds on to a tail-line, to prevent the dogs from running away. If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away. It is {{as much as they can}} do to walk; so the driver goes before them, in this case, and beats down the snow with his snow-shoes--"beats the track," [...] as it is called. The harness of the dogs is usually very gay, and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful tinkling sound.|$|E
6000|$|Our visitor had {{travelled}} in a dog cariole. This {{machine is}} very narrow, just broad enough to admit one person. It is a wooden frame covered with deer-skin parchment, painted gaudily, and is generally drawn by four Esquimaux dogs [see note 3]. Dogs are invaluable in the Arctic regions, where horses are utterly useless, {{owing to the}} depth of snow which covers the earth for so large {{a portion of the}} year. The comparatively light weight of the dogs enables them to walk without sinking much; and even when the snow is so soft as to be incapable of supporting them, they are still able to sprawl along more easily than any other species of quadruped could do. Four are usually attached to a sledge, which they haul with great vigour; being followed by a driver on snow-shoes, whose severe lash is brought to bear so powerfully {{on the backs of the}} poor animals, should any of them be observed to slacken their pace, that they are continually regarding him with deprecatory glances as they run along. Should the lash give a flourish, there is generally a short yelp from the pack; and should it descend amongst them with a vigorous crack, the vociferous yelling that results is perfectly terrific. These drivers are sometimes very cruel; and when a pack of dogs have had a fight, and got their traces hopelessly ravelled (as is often the case), they have been known to fall on their knees in their passion, seize one of the poor dogs by the nose with their teeth, and almost bite it off. Dogs are also used for dragging carioles, which vehicles are used by gentlemen in the Company's service who are either too old or too lazy to walk on snow-shoes. The cariole is in form not unlike a <b>slipper</b> <b>bath,</b> both in shape and size. It is lined with buffalo robes, in the midst of a bundle of which the occupant reclines luxuriously, while the dogs drag him slowly through the soft snow, and among the trees and bushes of the forest, or scamper with him over the hard-beaten surface of a lake or river; while the machine is prevented from capsizing by a voyageur who walks behind on snow-shoes, holding on to a line attached to the back part of the cariole. The weather during winter is so cold that it is often a matter of the greatest difficulty for the traveller to keep his toes from freezing, despite the buffalo robes; and sometimes, when the dogs start fresh in the morning, with a good breakfast, a bright, clear, frosty day, and a long expanse of comparatively open country before them, where the snow from exposure has become quite hard, away they go with a loud yelp, upsetting the driver in the bolt, who rises to heap undeserved and very improper epithets upon the poor brutes, who, careering over the ground at the rate of eleven miles an hour, swing the miserable cariole over the snow, tear it through the bushes, bang it first on one side, then on the other, against stumps and trees, yelling all the while, partly with frantic glee at the thought of having bolted, and partly with fearful anticipation of the tremendous welting that is to come; until at last the cariole gets jammed hard and fast among the trees of the forest, or plunges down the steep bank of a river head over heels till they reach the foot--a horrible and struggling compound of dogs, traveller, traces, parchment, buffalo robes, blankets, and snow! ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> {{were removed}} when the {{building}} was refurbished in the 1980's: the 'mikva bath' was latter restored.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Poplar Baths {{opened in}} 1852, costing £10,000. It {{was built to}} provide public wash facilities for the East End's poor {{as a result of}} the Baths and Washhouses Act 1846. The <b>baths</b> incorporated <b>slipper</b> and vapour <b>baths.</b> The <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> section contained 12 baths in the men's first-class division, 24 in the men's second-class and six in both women's divisions. Steam and shower baths were located behind the <b>slipper</b> <b>baths.</b> A comprehensive public laundry was located at the rear of the building, on Arthur Street. It contained 48 wooden washing tubs, drying equipment and ironing rooms. An uncovered water tank supplied the baths and was erected above the boiler house with a capacity of 24,000 gallons.|$|R
5000|$|Turning into Lambeth Walk, at no 5 is the Lambeth Walk Group Practice, a local NHS {{health centre}} run {{for many years}} by King's College London. The {{practice}} relocated to the site in 1996; the building was converted from a former public laundry and <b>slipper</b> <b>baths.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{the city}} council were {{building}} Northgate Arena, a leisure complex which included a swimming pool, and they stated {{that they would not}} be able to afford to run both this and the old baths. However the City of Chester Swimming Club were of the opinion that the new baths would not be suitable for competitive swimming or for water polo. The Chester Swimming Association was formed and they took over the management of the baths on 14 April 1977. They made improvements to the building, including the installation of gas central heating and a new water filtration system, the addition of a kitchen, cafeteria and gymnasium, and strengthening of the structure. The <b>slipper</b> <b>bath</b> was replaced by a clubroom and bar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} is partly in two storeys and partly in one storey. The frontage on Union Street is in two storeys. [...] The lower storey is in red Ruabon brick with stone dressings, the upper storey is half-timbered, and the decorated chimney stacks are brick. [...] Behind the frontage are the swimming baths and the boiler house {{is at the}} rear. The frontage is symmetrical; the small wing at the left originally contained the caretaker's flat and a <b>slipper</b> <b>bath.</b> The ground floor contains two arched entrances, each with double doors and windows. Between the entrances {{is a pair of}} ogee-headed windows, over which is a stone panel containing the city's coat of arms. The upper storey is jettied and has three gables. Beneath the middle gable is a five-light mullioned canted oriel window, and under the outer arches are four-light mullioned casement windows. [...] Internally there are two swimming baths. The larger, the Atlantic, 25 yd long, is deep enough for diving, and is surrounded by galleries. The other bath, the Pacific, is 20 yd long.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, the Friends of Dulwich Baths lobbied Southwark Council {{for repairs}} and £250,000 was {{invested}} in various re-developments including removing the women's <b>slipper</b> <b>baths.</b> In 2007, a full renovation plan of £5 million was agreed with Fusion taking over {{operation of the}} building as a leisure complex.|$|R
50|$|Bow Baths {{was badly}} bomb damaged during WW2 and never re-opened. In 1961, a new Bow Baths {{was built in}} Sutherland Place which {{included}} 60 <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> and a laundry block. This closed in 1977 as new housing and home improvements dramatically {{increased the number of}} homes with bathrooms.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{swimming}} baths of Northwich was the Verdin Baths, situated on Verdin Park. It was presented by Robert Verdin in {{commemoration of the}} Jublilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. It consisted of a [...] cast-iron plunge <b>bath</b> and five <b>slipper</b> <b>baths.</b> It was a largely timbered-framed building. As the entrance was approached, the motto [...] "Cleanliness is next to Godliness" [...] could be clearly seen along {{the front of the}} building. Whilst it supplied the needs of many, the accommodation was inadequate for what was required.|$|R
5000|$|Haggerston Baths in Hackney, London, {{was opened}} in 1904 as public baths. The baths were built {{at a cost}} of £60,000. There was a single pool, 91 [...] <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> and a 60 stall wash house.The Grade II listed Haggerston Pool was {{designed}} by Alfred Cross. It was closed in 2000 with an uncertain future. In June 2009 after a long community campaign, a £5m grant was announced from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to refurbish and re-open the pool. The building would also contain community facilities and a GP surgery.|$|R

50|$|Dame Emily Park, on {{the site}} of the old Dean Lane coal pit head (closed December 1906), is celebrated for its popular {{skateboard}} park and the vivid graffiti, the latter regularly updated by a variety of artists on a weekly basis. Greville Smyth Park is the largest local park and is popular for sports, families and dog walkers. Bristol South swimming pool, a grade II listed building in the south of Dame Emily Park is currently undergoing a renovation to modernise its facilities.Once a year you can look round the old <b>Slipper</b> <b>Baths</b> here on Bristol Open Doors. Southville Community Development Association (SCDA) is a local community-led organisation that supports many local projects and also runs the Southville Centre - a community centre, cafe, nursery, after school club and older peoples Monday club.|$|R
50|$|The {{south side}} of this street is {{dominated}} by the Victorian brick and Portland stone façade of the Woolwich Public Baths (H.H. Church, 1892-94). The building had five entrances (separate entrances for women and first and second-class men) and contained two large swinging pools, 52 <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> (private baths), a wash house and a laundry. The baths were modernized around 1960 and closed in 1982, after which it was used as a community centre and then as a students' union of the University of Greenwich. After the departure of the university from Woolwich, it has served as an administrative building and a rehearsal studio for drama students. Until recently, all the buildings {{on the north side of}} the street were part of the municipal enclave. The Magistrates' Court building (John Dixon Butler, 1911-12) had its main entrance on Market Street. The neo-classical building next to it was the rear elevation of the Woolwich Public Library, designed by H.H. Church in 1897 and built in 1900-01. Adjacent, a soup kitchen of 1913-14 was converted into a reading room for the library in 1979. The library closed in 2011 and was relocated consequently at The Woolwich Centre, opposite the town hall on Wellington Street. For the building on the corner of Polytechnic Street, see below.|$|R
50|$|Hillsborough baths (properly {{known as}} the Walkley and Hillsborough District Baths) on Langsett Road were built in 1926 by the Sheffield City {{architect}} F.E.P. Edwards on open fields belonging to Rawson Springs Farm. The baths (comprising a large swimming pool and <b>slipper</b> <b>baths)</b> were opened by the Lord Mayor John George Graves and have a Neo-baroque stone dressed façade with some circular windows. The building remained a swimming bath until 1991 when it {{was replaced by the}} Hillsborough Leisure Centre for swimming activities in the area. It then became the “Deep End” bar and live music venue before becoming the Rawson Spring public house in July 2007. Other pubs in the central area of Hillsborough have more history, The Shakey (formerly The Shakespeare), The Old Blue Ball and The Freemasons all pre-date the 1864 flood in which they were all badly damaged.There are two schools within Hillsborough, Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School on Ripley Street and Hillsborough Primary School on Parkside Road.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond the village, the {{landscape}} has two very unusual features: Creswell Crags and Markland Grips. Both are dolomitic limestone gorges but {{the former is}} much more important as the caves that it hosts have been found to contain not only prehistoric artefacts but also cave art.During World War II children used to play in the caves at the Crags. In the woods behind the Crags there is a quarry. The woods were a great place for sweet chestnuts. Markland Grips was popular for fishing, hazelnuts and blackberries. [...] By the mid 20th century Creswell supported facilities not to be found in other villages, such as a cinema and some baths. The original cinema was in King Street, but in the 1930s it burned down and was replaced. The new cinema on Elmton Road was a stylish art deco structure, built by the Rogers family and called the Regors. Like many others it became a bingo hall in the late 1960s. The baths were built in 1924. As a council facility they included not only a swimming pool but also <b>slipper</b> <b>baths</b> for the many homes that did not have their own bathrooms at that date.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Downing {{was perhaps}} the most bigoted anti-gym-shoeist in the whole list of English schoolmasters. He waged war remorselessly against gym shoes. Satire, abuse, lines, detention--every weapon was {{employed}} by him in dealing with their wearers. It had been the late Dunster's practice always to go over to school in gym shoes when, as he usually did, he felt shaky in the morning's lesson. Mr. Downing always detected him in the first five minutes, and that meant a lecture of anything from ten minutes to {{a quarter of an hour}} on Untidy Habits and Boys Who Looked Like Loafers--which broke the back of the morning's work nicely. On one occasion, when a particularly tricky bit of Livy was on the bill of fare, Dunster had entered the form room in heelless Turkish <b>bath</b> <b>slippers,</b> of a vivid crimson; and the subsequent proceedings, including his journey over to the house to change the heelless atrocities, had seen him through very nearly to the quarter-to-eleven interval.|$|R
60|$|They sit or recline huddled {{together}} against a rock, {{and they are}} farther from home, {{in every sense of}} the word, than ever before. Thirty-six hours ago, they were given three minutes in which to dress, without a maid, and reach the boats, and they have not made the best of that valuable time. None of them has boots, and had they known this prickly island they would have thought first of boots. They have a sufficiency of garments, but some of them were gifts dropped into the boat--Lady Mary's tarpaulin coat and hat, for instance, and Catherine's blue jersey and red cap, which certify that the two ladies were lately before the mast. Agatha is too gay in Ernest's dressing-gown, and clutches it to her person with both hands as if afraid that it may be claimed by its rightful owner. There are two pairs of <b>bath</b> <b>slippers</b> between the three of them, and their hair cries aloud and in vain for hairpins.|$|R
60|$|The {{facts of}} the {{burglary}} at the vicarage came to us chiefly {{through the medium of}} the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up in bed listening. She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his <b>bath</b> <b>slippers,</b> he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then a violent sneeze.|$|R
